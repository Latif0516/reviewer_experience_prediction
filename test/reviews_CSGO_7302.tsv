review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in. When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money. Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend. In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a "Hostage Rescue Kit", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.

review: I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia. I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus. I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind. My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze. I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia. Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning. My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished. Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn. The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room. _ Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people. Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway. Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before. I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value. I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came. The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow. My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade. I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head. I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.728mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words "NOT ON MY WATCH" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks. Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed. A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen. Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long- wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk. _ Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice. I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG; 9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself "I ing hate that gun" while typing out "#TAZED " in all chat. Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. "get rekt" "u suck" "TIME to die, amirite" Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round. From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will. The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes. Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a "REKT" holographic sticker and renamed "Clockwork Assing". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it. Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never. Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet. Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to  with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you. I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall. I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia.

review: I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.

review: As a veteran player having played since beta 5.4 (that's the original beta in 2000), I have to say they've done a great job at updating this game and still giving it the classic Counter Strike feel. The Competitive Matchmaking is well done and generally keeps teams balanced, even with a wide array of ranks on each team. The new modes are great and definitely show that the devs are listening to their community. If you like fast action, round based strategic scenario game play, then you should give CS:GO a shot.

review: I came to this game for my fetish of chickens. When playing the game, I realised that not every map has chickens on it, so I slowly got angrier with the game... The lack of chickens boiled my blood. CSGO made me angry, Until, I found my dream love, Deathmatch. A Chicken on any map, right then.. I'd kick the bots, and chase the chickens around for hours. Ah, It was so pleasurable, How I would do it for hours on end. The chickens are perfect. I play this game for hours on end, and the chickens never disapointment me now, Oh Chickens, how you are my one true love. I can't focus at school anymore.. I only think about chickens, on the way home from school there is a KFC, I walk past it every day, I think of chickens, One time, I literally stopped, and took a fap to one of the chickens. Ah, It was so good. Chickens I love them Oh Chickens THANK YOU GABEN 5/5 I love chickens.

Throw away everything you knew from CS:S because this game is different. Where the P90 was a standard SMG in CS:S, in this game, it's used as a smaller LMG. I still do love this game!

review: Once upon a time on de_inferno there existed a single chicken on A site. "I must get to my family!" said the father chicken. Navagating through all the stained karambits and battle-scarred asiimovs will prove quite the challenge. As the chicken creeps up the stairs into apartments he sees the glass shatter in the first room to his right. He scatters down the hallway anxious of what will happen next. There are 3 mysterious people wearing potato sacks on their head and must have applied way too much eye shadow. He sneaks past them and makes it into the crawlspace. "I can't believe it! I may actually live to see my family on B site fishing in the koi pond." AWP shots are being exchanged down the middle of the battlefield and the chicken hears flowerpots shattering here and there. As he gets to the exit of crawlspace he sees another potatosack creature hiding behinds a haystack and scuttles down into banana. "Who the hell drove a taxi down here?" says the chicken. He makes it down the dark ally and glances over to see the remains of his family. They are but feathers floating in the burnt sushi in the pond after a thrown molotov. "I.. I.... I can't belive thi-BOOM-." A cheeky CT sits in his spawn with an AWP as he giggles in his chair after murdering the poor creature in cold blood. Please, I beg of you, these chickens are endangered creatures and risk thier lives to venture through the city just to meet thier family again..

You really helped me a lot on English : ) and buried me with "Silver II, the Nu:B" on my tombstone. -------------------------------------------- Update 17/02/2015 Hey my foreign friends. Have fun in the Chinese Lunar new year! May the goat or sheep bless you and have a safe and sound 2015. Update 1/31/2015 400 hours and I'm still Silver 2. ------------------------------------------- Last Update before Christmas: Kids are lovely. "Carry us harder," he screamed. However, I'm just a lucky silver 2 with swag-7 and pro90. I tried my best to give him the Christmas present, but I failed. So sad. ------------------------------------------ Update something about racism. Well....as an Asian, I encountered lots of racism assaults during the gameplay. I would just simply mute the racist and report him after the match, cuz I play this game for fun and practicing English, not arguing with other players... Fortunately, most people are friendly and are willing to learn new things about Asia. Don't regard all the jokes as racism. I also made some friends online, people from East Europe, State people and Canadians. Hope the world can develop in peace and go hell terrorism! Yes, that refers to you, ISIS. Go hell. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prefer it to Rising Storm, because it has a crosshair. Prefer it to Tomb Raider, because I don't have to aim by holding R-mouse. Prefer it to Call of Duty, because I would know how I died. Playing CS:GO is a good way to practice English. Not suitable for foreign youngsters, because I learned lots of four letter word from this game.

game-hours: 806.2
review: A full upgrade over its predecessor Counter-Strike: Source, Global Offensive manages to revive its playerbase that was lost from the previous game and (as always) introduces new players to the franchise. If I were to briefly describe it, I'd say it's a "Modern Day Classic". There are 4 modes: The main 2 are Casual and Competitive, while the other 2 are Arms Race (Gun game) and Demolition (like Gun game but a kill awards only 1 weapon to be used in the next round). There is also a Deathmatch mode, basicaly TDM, that is usually used for practising different weapons. With the Arms Deal update, which introduced camos and some weapons to the game, there are drops at the end of matches and it slightly feels like TF2, but not to that extent. The Matchmaking system is kind of "meh", although it is much better than some other games I've played. In Competitive, there is a 50-50 chance for you to join a balanced game without your team being on a losing streak (that is if you go solo....it's quite a gamble...) There are also some minor hitreg issues that are barely noticable but still important enough to determine the outcome of the round...aaaaaand it's very freaking annoying too (64 tick.... -_-) If you intend to take this game seriously, you can join a competitive team (5 people) and spend time practising recoils patterns and the like. Who knows! You might end up entering a tournament! As far as game content is concerned, new guns and camos are constantly being added to the game. Plus, Valve introduces Operations (Last one was Operation Phoenix and current one is Operation Breakout) that include a handful of new maps from the workshop. After about 2-3 months ( I may be wrong) the Operation ends and there is a vote about which maps people enjoyed the most. 2 of the most voted maps are added to the main game while some others pass on to the next Operation. The only thing I dislike about this, is the fact that a ticket is required and will set you back 6$ if you are willing buy it at the start. The price drops over time so I suggest entering when it is about a dollar or so. Overall, with the price of 11 (~15$) it's much more than you pay for and with more than 550 hours currently in the game, I can safely say I'm very satisfied. Great game 9.5/10.

review: I used to be an Xbox addict. But after playing this game, I have now stopped playing xbox for months. After all the years of playing COD i have finally figured out why I never had a girl friend. I was alone, played alone, lived alone, I thought it would never end... Then my friends told me about steam and after a while I found this game, Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I was excited to play it, i played it everyday NONSTOP until i felt like going to sleep. One day, I woke up and of course started playing cs go, I noticed what i have became...a csgo addict. I didn't know what to do when i was thinking of that. I quickly shut off my computer and went outside for once. I thought about what i was thinking...I decided to go back inside, still trying to get it out of my head..."a csgo addict". I started crying...I didn't know what to do. I couldn't stop playing now...I have only just begun. I looked at all the money i had left and wasted it on cs go skins. The addiction is growing. I couldn't stop it even if a tried, thats when i realized...that i have fully became a cs go addict. To this day, I'm still a cs go addict. I love cs go and will never stop playing it... 10/10 Ruined my life that i never had...

review: It's different than previous installments in the series. The recoil of the weapons is dramatic and infuriatingly unreal looking. It's very possible to almost completely miss a target standing in front of you at no more than 1 meter (gamewise meter) and deliver only one hit with the AK. The AWP for example isn't the surgical instrument of death no more. The shoot area isn't a dot (the dot in the center of your reticle) but a quite large "box". Also the physics of it seem a bit off, I cannot understand how you can be stopped from running from being hit with a smoke grenade, HE grenade, flash bang or molotov/incendiary. It is ridiculous and reminds me of the old stuck-in-the-ground with smoke launched at feet bug in Counter-Strike 1.4. I have the frustrating sensation that I am constantly playing a BETA game, a BETA I have purchased. Also lots of cheaters in Competitive matches. Competitive matches were supposed to be the bread and butter of the new series but the experience is very often destroyed by obvious cheat using players. I guess it is so easy to cheat in this game since there are lots of them. The Overwatch isn't helping much and participating in the Overwatch program ruins the faith in this program because 4 in 5 demos submited to Overwatch have players blatantly using wallhack. I guess the Overwatch can VAC ban one and while 10 more players start using it. In spite of all it has potential, it looks good and the maps, the old ones and the new ones added, are interesting and fun to play.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter and the next generation of Counter-Strike running on updated Source Engine and has many new features added. The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. This means slightly less weapons recoil and no need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further. Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system. Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving. You either die as a noob or live long enough the get a title hacker. This is yet the best Counter-Strike game where casual and hardcore gamers can play. I recommend this. Rating 9/10

review: I really want to recommend this game. It's a more immersive shooter than any of the Call of Duty series, and the way the game is made requires logical thinking and tactical strategies to win rounds with your teammates. When the game goes well, it's buckets of fun. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to newcomers. There are many reasons for this. First of all, unless you plan to mill around in deathmatch or the other lesser-played game modes (so anything but casual/competitive), you're going to die, a lot. And then you wait. You watch your uncooperative anonymous Russian teammates slowly break apart and lose the rounds in the most ludicrious fashion. If you can stand the game long enough to become half decent at it, you may find that you can often shoot someone in the head, literally tracing the bullet into their cranium, only to see that it doesn't register the hit due to the sub-standard 64 tickrate matchmaking servers and/or your West Country internet connection, thus falling victim to yet another unfair situation. If your internet connection is not the problem, you may try using ESEA or Faceit to play your competitive matches with. So you can pay more to play the game for no benefit other than to escape the crap quality of the standard servers, or faff about on Faceit, waiting for the afk team captains to pick maps, or the other team to cower away during the initial deciding knife round. After a few bad experiences, I've decided that Faceit isn't worth the hassle. Playing competitive also puts you in danger of not only numerous wallhackers, but mainly these things called smurfs. Put the image of the little happy blue creature out of your head: these are the players with a high rank on their first steam account, then make second/third/fourth accounts to play against easier opponents. It's that simple, yet it's infuriating and game-destroying for us lower ranked players. And when you discover this in a competitive game, your only choices are to stay there and endure it, gradually losing your sanity, or take a competitive ban. If you're lucky enough to have decent friends, they may just kick you from the game, sparing you of either choice. Having played almost 3 solid week's worth of the game in total, I have accumulated a wide friend group who also shares my pain, but we still play together for the social side. This is when I can recommend the game: when you've already played a lot of CS:GO and have many friends that also play the game. If you're new, and have less patience than a special forces marksman, you're going to hate this game. I hope that if you decide to play this game, you can take my advice with a pinch of salt, as I am admittedly easily riled up in the heat of the moment. However, if you too go ape, you only have yourself to blame. Also, look out for skin collecting. I've been caught by it, it saps a lot of your money, and is literally an addiction. Not a good one like being immersed in a fandom or crack cocaine: one that's ultimately utterly pointless.

review: I honestly do not like this game at all. This is my personal preference, I do not enjoy the round-based gameplay, I very much prefer jumping into a game and enjoying a no holds barred gorefest. But for all the readers out there, I'm throwing away my bias when it comes to reviewing this game! THE GOOD: The graphics for this game are very pretty. The game and everything (or mostly everything) in it has been polished greatly since the last rendition While I don't like the competitive gamemode (or casual, for that matter), I CAN acknowledge that when I DID play the game, I did feel that this gamemode really did capture the charm and tension that the other Counter-Strike games gave off. Deathmatch and Arms Race can be quite fun, using most of the Counter-Strike mechanics without the round-based gameplay that the rest of the game is so popular for THE BAD: The way the skins work make no sense. I can't understand how two people would get the same skin on the same gun, only to have one get factory new and the other battle-scarred. Personally, I feel the skins would make much more sense they would drop as factory new and deteriorate over time. Granted, it'll never work now, as it would definitely ruin the economy... The spawns in Deathmatch/Arms Race are horrible. while they've been improved over the months, I would still have an occasional issue where I'd kill one guy, only to have them respawn close by and shoot me down moments later. OVERALL: While I don't enjoy round-based gameplay, and the deathmatch spawns are too shoddy for me to truly enjoy it, I'd still really recommend the competitive gamemode to those who are really interested in that kind of thing. This game has a HUGE playerbase, so you'll never be left waiting for hours for a game! While this review gives off most of what I wanted to get across, I also wrote a slightly more detailed version over on my blog.

Learn to use it. 5) The guns have rubber barrels so when you hold the trigger for more than 3 shots, the bullets will go all over the screen. 6) P90 was crafted by Gods so it's users are not hackers. 7) If you have the bomb, sit behind your team like a good dog. 8) The game's secret name is Counter-Strike: Dust 2. 9) Competitive is the main game mode but there are other modes for your little kids too! 10) If you easily get brain cancer just from losing one match STAY AWAY FROM COMPETITIVE! you psycho!

review: Every-time this game goes on sale something inside of me dies. Thinking ( Here comes more hackers and smurfs ) 494,368 in game right now which is the highest peak it ever reached until now. EDIT : Now its 595,439 Anyway Csgo is a great game. I mean if you don't know any of the counter-strike series thats really bad because you have to, it is the basic fps game out there. In csgo it is even more fun and much more in-depth than Counterstrike:source. More modes more maps, and matchmaking systems and customize-able skins. I'v had a few people who don't know it thinking you buy better weapons with money. Nope all players same weapons just different colors ( Skins ) Thats all But the sad part of the game is having a lot of hackers, everytime it goes on sale = more and more hackers. Well that said you can play a lot of games without encountering one and just having some fair maps. But at ( Competitive ) mode you are most likely to encounter more hackers than you can count because thats the ranked mode in the game. Anyway, My favorite Fps on steam, I Loved Source so much but after getting into Global offensive i dont see myself trying source ever again. Also in this game you get weapon drops after finishing maps ( Random drops ) so you can trade/sell on market and gain some money, I got about 89$ from selling those stuff. good for people who wants to waste all their time on an FPS and still get something out of it.

review: So Counter Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest revision of the long running Half-Life mod fps. Created by Hidden Path the game is more of a refinement towards modern day military shooters then previous instalments such cs 1.6, cscz and css. This is mainly to allow a more broaden appeal to the masses of COD and Battlefield generation. You see CS generally has always had a very hardcore user base that is highly skilled. You'd be lucky to find yourself top of your first few games as a beginner like you could do in the fore-mentioned rival franchises in competitive multiplayer. How have they achieved this and to what extent it is successful is down to personal preference. The newly included arms race and demolition modes allows for a more fast pace and tightly confined CQC mode that allows the players little to no down time unlike the traditional bomb/defuse or hostage maps that most players are familiar with. For me though these modes are not the real meat of the game and if youre an experienced player these will only be glanced over and served as a side show at before delving into the traditional modes. The inclusion of some new weapons and equipment helps to change up csgo such as the Molotov and allow for different variations of old school tactics. Most of the well know maps are available from the offset and the workshop community is as good as it gets with newly created maps, game types and weapon skins to name but a few. There is the introduction of operation payback whereby a selection of community maps are promoted and available for players for a small fee across the whole of csgo and some of these are a delight to play. So why would you choose this over css for the experienced player. I find that it adheres to the original 1.6 far more closely then css ever did. The aiming is tight and follows the recoil sprays on many of the automatic guys far more closely. There are many updates that valve and hidden path are pushing though, such as spectator mode, competition spectators i.e. Dreamhack, newly released weapon finishes through drops and crate drops and newly revised maps being released mirage and cobble to name but a few. For me the main reason for this instalment above all others if the great competitive mode. Ranked csgo was never really available unless you sign up to a league such as ED, played pcws or cups. Now however with competitive mode 5vs5 ranked games are a blast if not for a few small problems that really need to be ironed out. These include dropped players being replaced by bots, hacking and over watch submissions, uneven rank matches to name but a few. If you though take the game as it meant to be played as a highly skilled social and fun game then the latest version of this simple but vastly complex game will delight you as it has me.

review: Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.

review: Whether you're a casual FPS gamer or a very competitive hard-core player, CS:GO is where it's at. A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value. There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option. CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals. It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!). Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics. You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky! I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS). The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000! It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5. With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot. Don't be discouraged by the learning curve. With great effort, comes great rewards! Now GO buy it!!

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is arguably the best game on the market. Ever. CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive henceforth) sets new standards for FPS gaming. Guns 'n Glory (mostly Guns) CS:GO, like COD: Whatevercrap, features many guns. CS:GO features two different teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, with distinct armories. Ranging from the classic Desert Eagle, which pwns faces, to the CZ25, a freakin' auto pistol, to the SCAR-20, an AUTOMATIC SNIPER RIFLE, to the infamous AK-47, CS:GO's wide range of weapons allows for adaptable play-style (or in other words, AWP ALL THE ROUNDS). Players can even customize their own guns, naming them, stickering them and painting them with in-game skins. CS:GO also features other non-gun weaponry. Grenades are prominent in rounds, from the classic High Explosive Grenade to Flashbangs to Moltovs. Players also can utilise Kevlar Armor and Helmets, which are useful against most guns. Finally, you can tase people. Fun. Gameplay/Gamemodes Unlike CS:S and 1.6, CS:GO kicks butt with new gamemodes. Different playstyles are designed with time and experience in mind- now, those without much time can play quicker games such as Arms Race, where players compete to get a kill with every weapon. It moves on to Demolition, a "simplified" version of Classic with only one bombsite, and no freedom in what weapons the player uses. Then, we get to the big leagues, with Casual, a drop-in game style much like Competitve, but more relaxed without early-dropout penalties and free armour. Then, there's competitive. This is where it really gets fun. 5v5 teams, the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, fight to the death to plant a bomb or save hostages. Competitive really brings out teamwork and strategy. Players have to buy guns and armour strategically, and winning counts. Competitve is really the crowning jewel of CS:GO. It even evens out the "unfairness" of maps, allowing both teams to play 15 rounds per side. Graphics/Performance CS:GO is not at all taxing on computers. I myself own a 2GB RAM computer, and it runs perfectly fine on lower Graphics settings. Other computers, such as that monster 16GB Alienware, can run on high setttings, beautifully visualising the different maps made by Valve and the Community. Hats? While CS:GO does not have hats (damn), it does feature weapon skins and stickers. Deck your own guns out with sick skins, whether it be as colourful as "Death By Kitty" for the P90, or as bloody serious as Crimson Web for the SCAR-20. Players can get skins by playing on VAC-secured serverts (nobody likes cheaters), unboxing Weapon Crates with Keys (think TF2), trading with other players, or buying them from the community market. Some guns are *special* (like me!), with StatTrak guns letting players count the kills acheived by the gun, or Souvenir-versions based on pro-tournaments. CS:GO also recently added stickers. Players can put stickers on their guns to show support for their favourite pro-teams, support for Eco-Rounds or dancing bannanas. Community CS:GO has an amazing community. The Steam Workshop has new skins and maps for players to try out, and in Operations, Valve adds these wondorus creations to CS:GO. In addition, there is a very supportive community online. Anybody who isn't gets an AWP to the face. Big deterrent. Overall, CS:GO is a great game. BUY IT FREAKIN' NOW!

review: Too many things are wrong in this game,movement is not smooth, awp and deagle are innacurate and not fun to play anymore, p90 and running is , flashes are not efective, nades are not accurate, limited wallbanging and  ammo limitation on M4, maps cluttered with unexpected props and corners to slow you down, certain areas are not wide enough and causes acidental TK on rushes and inability to rush fast as an whole, and the most important, recoil does not allow you to kill multiple enemies in 1 magazine in a short period of time, you are limited to short bursts and take cover, and that removes the ability to clutch rounds which was the most fun aspect in other versions. It prevents good skilled aimers from carrying a team. Also most maps are really bad unbalanced copies of CSS maps, like inferno and train, and people are forced to pay for operation passes to play extra maps in matchmaking. On the other hand there are many improvements in money and weapon balance specially on ecos, and other misc stuff like the GUI, matchmaking and de_nuke balanced, and I would rather play GO with this problems fixed than going back to 1.6 anyday, but at this moment the game is not fun anymore and gameplay is not fully oriented for competitive gameplay. I only play it because nobody plays the other versions anymore, and most people have to eat it up. This game had very low player count before the steam market update since the game was really bad, but after it many people started playing it to earn skins, so most of the players dont care about the game, they just idle for drops and watch streams to know on wich teams to bet on csgolounge, they dont actually care about the game, it is a sad truth and its clear that Hidden Path will never update this game to proper conditions.

review: In my opinion, this game is still very young and undeveloped and all the hate against russians is stupid. I mean i'm not one to talk here i hate them sometimes aswell. I realised something when i was playing one day, the game has gone trough a lot of changes and that it was slowly turning into a moba like game, where rank is more importand than having fun. How valve changed CS for me made me yonder and ponder from the time when i was playing CS 1.6 or CSS. Back then there where no rankings nor matchmaking and the servers where flooded with ads. I really hate how people neglect the times when people were fun to play with. Now people only care about how big your rank is, and how expensive your skins are. Where are the good old times? To me this game is a mess because of the ranking system and i mustn't recommend it for players from CS 1.6 OR CSS. Sure there are different mods, but people mostly play competitive and try to force their rank down your throat.

review: This game was the best tactical game I had ever played. The community was good, people were mature, sportsmanship was very well presented. But all of that changed when the skins came. The community of Counter Strike that we knew and loved got shattered in an instant. This community is turning into TF2 but instead of hats it is skins. It's a pathetic excuse from valve to build an economy to make more money off of virtual items. Really valve? You are turning this game into TF2 and it's a joke. More immature underage children are playing this game now and I don't like and I am certain that I am not the only one who thinks this way. First off, the community now is a disgrace. You could be playing with someone, become really good friends with them and then they ask for one of your good skins to "borrow". BAM! Skins stolen and your hard work has meant nothing. It increases the scamming within this steam community. Second, the competitive mode is great. It is challenging and very teamwork based, but all that can change with a steam sale. Hackers banned? Well then let's price Counter Strike: Global Offensive to 3.50. Oh boy that was a good idea right? A steam sale on this game is not only hurting us but steam as well. People also buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive on a different account, so that means if you are a low rank in competitive not only are you against a higher rank but you are also at a high chance to lose. It's a complete and utter disaster when it happens. It needs to end. Thirdly, Cases are ridiculous. You literally have a 0.01% chance to get a "Rare special item" (Knife). People waste so much money on cases when at the end of the day it's a "Virtual Item". You could go out and buy a real knife for about 50 at highest while the highest in this game is about 600. The economy is terrible. Community is terrible. Skins are a joke and Steam are probably laughing at you as you go out and waste money on cases. Fourthly and lastly is the, "Hit Detection". This game has a pretty bad hit detection system. Valve could go out and buy 124 tick servers but nope! they go out and be cheapskates and buy 64 tick servers which is god awful. I mean Valve, Come on! You make millions of  and $, why can't you actually just think about your game instead of how much money you take a bath in? This game is great once you get into it and "IF" you find a decent server (124 tick) it is pretty fun. One other thing I forgot to mention is when you play competitive there is a cooldown if you "leave", "Kill a teammate", "Kick too many players" or even if your power cuts during a match, you only have "3 minutes" to return to the match. Abandon the match? Ok sir we give you a 7 day ban. A ban ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours to 24 hours to finally 7 days. It is a bit unfair the banning system. It is automatic so it cannot be revoked. Please Valve, fix your game and your community before it wrecks itself. 6/10 for Gameplay 2/10 for Skins 3/10 for Community 0/10 for Competitive Cooldown

review: Initially I was very hesitant about this game; it seemed very risky to make so many fundamental changes to a formula that was barely changed through Counter-Strike: Source and Condition Zero. However, seeing how much Valve has listened and continues to listen the community, and how quickly they make changes in both the short and long term, it has completely restored my faith in the game. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is incredibly fun and feature-rich, with plenty to do for both casual and competitive players. On top of this, there is also plenty of ways to promote and support eSports, which is a much-needed and fundamental step in reinvigorating Counter-Strike in the competitive gaming scene. However, the most important thing with this game is that the community is incredibly nice and friendly - and with a game as difficult and intense as Counter-Strike, it's extremely welcoming. Good stuff!

review: Great true Counter-Strike-like competitive feeling in this latest addition to CS games. It has most of the elements from the older CS games (1.6 and Source) but with updated visuals, weapon skins and stickers, matchmaking system and a goal to unite the two different Counter-Strike communitites: CS1.6 and CSS. This game does that pretty well having a lot of the good old content but still a lot of new stuff to discover. + + Easy to use Matchmaking system. + Updated content (some new weapons that were not in CS1.6 or CSS and new versions of all the classic maps) + Overwatch is a great way to get the community involved in banning cheaters but it's not perfect system (not at all) A lot of important information about the match is not available for overwatchers and in order to get ow you need to win 150 matchmaking games and have a rank at atleast Gold Nova 1. Players on that level are usually not good enough to judge is someone is cheating or not and some more suspicious cases may get more votes on "Evidence beyond reasonable doubt" even when no cheating is involved. + Skins and stickers. These things keep a lot more casual players playing the game and gives the more competitive ones new and exiting content in the game after playing the game for thousands of hours. + Operations that make people play the new maps and all the available official gamemodes makes the game to have more content (operations are usually pretty cheap ~5 containing usually 5 or more maps that can be played on Valves official servers and some kind of scoreboard that keeps track of your matchmaking stats like kills, headshot % and matches won) + Big professional tournamets mainly funded by the community. You buy a certain key to open a weapon case (Esport key in this case is the one that supports electronic sports) and a portion of the money goes towards these tournamets. These big events gather a lot of Counter-Strike people together watching the games and having some great entertainment. When the professional scene does well the game itself attracts more people playing it. + Game gets updated really often compared to many other multiplayer shooters. Sometimes there can be updates every week some of them being quite major. Valve even listens to the community sometimes to make the game even better and more enjoyable. (Obviously they want to hear what the pros have to say about the current state of the game) - - Lots of hackers playing in the higher rankings in matchmaking. As Valve killed boosting in its known form most cheaters are just the one who want get to those highest ranks. Still some boosting appears to be seen even tho it doesn't work like that anymore. - Matchmaking system is quite broken. Rankings don't show the true skill and ability to play as a team but it still serves the purpose. MM being 64 tick is the main problem or atleast thats what the community says when it comes to the system itself. Most players would still pick hackers over low tickrate if it was about matchmaking as whole. The problem around this is that to be able to get any advantage of 128 tick your game needs to run at atleast that 128 fps (not exatly but close to it) and according to Valve greatly over half of the players have an average fps of 30 or less. Thats not enough to get any advantage of high tickrate servers. Another proble with matchmaking is that sometimes it puts higher ranks against lower ones which is not equal at all and usually results in a slaughter of either side. Balance just sometimes isn't there. - Bad behaviour among many players makes some matchmaking games really feel like you'd like to punch somebody. People that refuse to use teamwork or communicate are even worse than bad behaving ones when you want/need to win games. - Valve has a weird way of updating something (like buffing a weapon) without any testing if it will actually work like it was supposed to. This has lead to CZ-75, AUG buff, the insane Tec-9 buff and a lot more weird but sometimes even funny updates. Still a little bit of testing on the field wouldn't hurt anyone. All in all I would totally recommend this game for everyone! Even if it may seem difficult at first you can only get better by learning and playing. For me it has been quite 4.5/5 experience so far so if you have the will give it a go!

Physics has become even more disgusting. Particularly noticeable shooting Deagle. Played since closed beta test, nothing has changed after the release, with the exception of a couple of buttons on top (Show matches, Achievements, Inventory) Fairly well made selection matches conveniently find any game on the official server with good ping. (As there is not official server). In general, play nice, if you spend a lot of time to learn how to shoot. Overall CS and should be such for a given time. 9/10

review: I first came to cs from tf2 and a couple other single player games, being recommended it by a few of my online friends. I expected: A badly made, generic shooter filled with gimmicks to keep the player interested and a pay to win sort of system. I recieved: An absolutely amazing game with lots of depth and an insane amount of skill and strategy involved. At first I found the amount of effort, skill and stategy you have to put into player positioning and things of that nature was just astounding, and unlike any other game I had seen before. I took a massive liking to this type of game and started playing more and more. At first you will have difficulty understanding these things but putting more time and effort into the game will show results quickly. I just wanted to do a review of this game as I believe CS:GO is truly great and unlike any other game out there! Thanks for reading! ~envy

review: I purchased this game on release day and played it for about three hours. It was absolute crap and I un-installed it. Fast forward almost one year and my friend recommended I try it again. Well, i've got to say that the game has come a long way and has vastly improved from it's release version. The game is basically 1.6 with improved graphics and mechanics. While it still needs work in many areas, the current state of the game is highly enjoyable and worth the mediocre price of $14.99. If you're a long time CS player like me (Beta 1) and don't have this game yet, add me to your friends list and we'll reminisce about the old days and maybe i'll throw a copy your way.

review: I'll start off by saying that I haven't played CS:GO all that much yet, but here are some of my first impressions of the game: -The actual gameplay is flawless and it offers more than enough customization options to ensure your comfortability with the controls. There is also a huge abundance of guns, maps and unique game types to pick from. -I'm sure a lot of people are discouraged by the extremely high skill cap but I feel that the game's increased difficulty, relative to other first-person shooters, makes it much more rewarding. It is way more satisfying when you do finally get the hang of it. :) -I typically don't pay any attention to the chat/voice communication in multiplayer games such as this, but I quietly observed it from time to time for the sake of this review. I can tell you that just like in many other games, the community can be pretty toxic towards new players and just in general. Ignore the rage and you'll be fine. :P -CS:GO has a workshop with loads of community made maps that introduce unique game-modes and styles. It goes without saying that this adds hours, maybe even days, to the replayability and allows you as the player to better customize the way you play and enjoy the game. Overall, it's an awesome game and I only wish I had picked it up sooner! If you can handle the somewhat toxic community and the high skill cap, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the perfect first-person shooter and I recommend it! :)

review: This modern version of one of the best competitive games of all times does a good job in introducing new players to this highly tactical and skill-based gaming experience. If you are a veteran of the old days  CS:GO might disappoint you. It sure looks nice but lacks the precision that made CS 1.6 so damn good. Its still a very good Counter-Strike, though.It may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps, and little features of past games, but Global Offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking Counter-Strike for whoever wants it. Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.Brilliant old-school shooter has convinced us that Counter-Strike franchise is in no way to be retired or forgotten.At the end, what matters is not if CS:GO is innovative or more of the same than CS: Source, what counts is if it's fun. And CS:GO couldn't be better in this regard.

review: I have to say, originally, I did not want anything to do with this game. I have been a big fan of the series since starting with Beta 4 way back when. After CS:S was released, I was very content with the way the series had been progressing. The updated gameplay and graphics gave me a boosted interest in a game I had not played in several years. When Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was released, I was not feeling the same way. The frantic and well edited trailers made the game look spectacular, that is until I noticed it was still running on the source engine, albeit a modified version. Given the hefty price tag, I stayed away from CS:GO for as long as possible, until I noticed how many updates had been made since the first CS:GO beta, and the subsequent gold release. It was obvious, the developer planned on putting as much effort into maintaining the game as they were to keep the game fresh and even competitive. Once I finally bought the game on sale for a decent price, I realized what I had been missing. Competitive mode has changed the way the game feels and works. It was very easy to get bored playing CS:S, because as the popularity increased, so did the servers. Pretty soon you were competing against 32 players on the opposing team, making for a hellish free-for-all, despite the team based combat. CS:GO found the perfect solution by introducing a competitive game mode. Instead of having to play with your friends in 5v5 tournaments, CS:GO incorporated a 5v5 mode that mirrored the professional experience, making it a lot more fun to play. The fine-tuned competitive mode, coupled with officially supporting death match and the arsenal game modes, making CS:GO a game with a lot more re-playability, and a lot more fun. Some people are critical about the inclusion of skins, turning CS:GO into Team Fortress 2, but they fail to recognize the importance of customization. The skins don't really impact the gameplay, and are not overly obnoxious like some of the content included in TF2. In addition to the developer created content, the inclusion of community created weapon skins and operations allow community members to profit while increasing the awareness and fun of the game. I am not a fan of DLC, especially since most DLC is lack-luster overpriced content that should have normally been included in the game at launch, but was separated out to pay-for downloadable content in the interest of pumping out sequels and printing money instead of focusing on quality. CS:GO however, chooses community content to include, and gives back to the authors who continue to breath life into the game. Overall, I was skeptical when it was first released, but the developer's constant attention to detail and genuine intention to keep the game balanced and competitive has made this the best game in the series. I highly recommend fans of the series update to CS:GO and enjoy themselves.

review: Yes yes and yes. Very fun! And one of my favourite games. It is very different from other games where you can just run around like a noob and expect to be the best player, this game is all about accuracy, tactics and team work which is great! There is always an intense feeling that I don't get from any other games!

review: A great fps. I'm relatively me to pc gaming so I'm more of a cod player but cs go is definately the better of the two. Great game to play with friends and I highly reccomend buying it. Cheap price, One hell of a game!

review: ne of the most prominent multiplayer fps right now Counter Strike:Global Offensive is also one the most renowned! The recipe of success for this game was very specific and it is not neccesarily related only to its visual part or the sound effects. The technical sector works fine and will leave everyone contented! Nevertheless its charm is located to the intriguing way it puts you to cooperate with other players and deal with various scenarios either you belong to the terrorists or to the counter-terrorists. Additionally there is a big variety of different levels and modes where you are called upon to put your reflexes to the test and stressful situations demand speed and effectiveness! On the whole i strongly recommend this game if you are on the lookout for a Multiplayer FPS which is not only realistic but also fascinating.

review: The FUTURE of competitive gaming. I expect to see every family playing counter strike together within the decade. Families gathered around the telescreen, waiting for that last final clutch. The father fires one shot from his polished AK, it's wooden gloss glinting in the sun of the map of the year. The shot rings out, from the speakers of the telescreen. In that moment, the son contemplates his life's future. He sees a happy family playing by a white picket fence, his arm around his young wife's waist as they plant the "SOLD" sign on the front lawn. The daughter sees her prince charming, as they walk down the aisle together into an endless union of love. The father sees his glory days from college, the boys in his frat, and the touchdown pass he made his senior year. The mother sees herself with the young football star she fell in love with, two young mavericks against the world. The shot hits home, the match is won. The family hugs, their joy clearly visible together. They climb the stairs to bed, and prepare for tomorrow's activities. Tonight was just another normal night, but together they've all experienced something they'll never forget together. As you lay in bed this night, picture that scene in your mind's eye. You, your happy family all gathered to enjoy the future of competitive gaming. That's what Counter Strike Global Offensive was made for.

review: By the time of this review I've played for a little over 11 hours. The moment I launched it for the first time, the main menu music had me hyped. I got addicted from a single music track. Then, when I played my first round in Competitive, I got completely obliterated. I started to play more rounds, and started becoming a decent player. So I'm just going to stop this review right here, and I'm telling you.. Buy this game. 10/10

review: Focusing on the quality of servers, my experience has been a 5/10 satisfaction with them. Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and "var", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just "bad" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012.

I have tried getting into it with friends on three different time and each time i get more dissapointed. The ammount of players never changes. The only reason they still have it as one of the top selling games is because of all the people buying for alternate accounts and its just sad that they have to do that please don't give valve money for this trainwreck they get enough from all the smurfs and hackers buying it for their alternate accounts.

CS:GO is no match for previous iterations of CS. Sadly.

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

PEOPLE JUST RDM ME FOR NO REASON, AND HALF THE TIME I'M A T, IT'S RIDICULOUS. I also think there is a glitch, because everytime I spawn it doesnt say innocent nor traitor in the bottom right. Whenever I get on this game I am constantly reminded of how bad I suck, and how awful people are for RDM. This game makes me cry everytime, yet I can't stay away from it, kinda like my ex-girlfriend.

review: Well, it could be a good game. BUT there is something really messed up here... the game crashes a lot sometimes. Most of them at the start of the competitive matches. And if you cant connect back in time you get pentality. I got 7 days of pentality now because the power went out and my PC restarted. I cant really understand why cant they do at least something that checks that you left a match with error message or you even offline from steam suddenly. All my pentalities (except one) was all the games fault. Any we payed for this game and sometimes i dont even had a HUD or crosshair. Once it loaded me in the sky a didnt let me in. I could watch the whole warmup but after that it ended and told me that i failed to connect the match in time. But I was there all the time...

review: Hi VALVe! Thank you so much that you KILLED my favourite game again, because of your 2 eur price, I can't play another 2-3 months, CHEATERS everywhere, and they simply DONT CARE, because its cheaper then their ing cheat. How about making this game Free2Play, and CHEATERS vs CHEATERS. If you care about the game, don't play it for a long time, you will only get RAGE not fair play.  2EUR!  IT HARD!

review: Very addicting game. The strongest point this game has is its history. The game has been around for over a decade. It has a very steep learning curve, and a high skill ceiling to match. The most vibrant competitive scene of any FPS on the market. You can see my full review of the game here.

review: It's important to appreciate games like this for what they are, and this game is a callback to a past chapter of video game history that's been buffed and polished. And unfortunately as someone who never actually played the original Counter-Strike games, I'm not in much of a position to judge exactly how well they pulled this off. Basically, it entirely boils down to the kind of person you are. If you're a die-hard Counter-Strike fan, then this is probably all you can ask for. If you're a more typical gamer who just finished playing Crysis or Battlefield and wants to pick up something to play over the weekend, then trust me when I say that this is NOT the game for you. It's the online FPS equivilent of Dark Souls, in a way.

review: I've spent exactly 1.2k hours playing this game in all my accounts , i've found that this game is the best FPS game you can ever play. And here's why : First of all , you need some skills to play this game correctly , and when you get enough skills , you'll get more fun and more fun! Second , if you play this game with your friends , you'll get into it faster than playing SOLO , so its more fun with your friends instead of playing with randoms , then u'll try to be more better especially if you find a decent mates-team that plays with you , you'll start looking for some strats , then you'll play it more like serious. Third , for graphics , i dont really care about any game's graphics when its fun , but CS:GO's graphics are decent so there is no reason to complain about it. 4th , its gameplay , that every COD player complains about it. especially 'recoil' its really hard to control it but that's the the game you need to practice with your recoil , and try to find out the best settings you can play with. And there is alot of good things about this amazing game but sadly i cannot write them all in one review . And there is some bad things about this game , like after every update some people start getting some weird lags , i think they need to fix it , and if you're looking to play this game more serious , dont play on MatchMaking servers , because its full of R_E_T_A_R_D_S and alot of trolls and its a land of AFKs , thats just made me feel mad , just go on esea , esl , leetway and so on , and one more thing , and its after about every steam sale , CS:GO become a land of cheaters , and thats just redicouless. The reason why I'm not playing much lately because I need to focus on better life decisions and many important things. Finally i hope you find this review a helpful review and thanks for reading.

review: This is a really good, casual yet uncasual multi-player FPS that pits two teams against one another. The Terrorists and the counter-terrorists (counter strikers). The terrorists need to make it to specific bomb drop points and hold the position until the bomb goes off. The counter-strikers need to kill the terrorists need to disarm the bomb if it is set or if they kill a terrorist holding the bomb before it is set, they need to make sure no one picks up the bomb to set it. If all members of one faction die, they lose the round. There is no respawn until the next round. All rounds take place on the current map. You don't go to a different map until the match ends. Since you play a few rounds per game (let's say 15 rounds), you get cash for each round win or lose and you can spend that cash at the start of each round on weapons and stuff. So the game increases as you go from just pistols and knives in the first round to much bigger guns in the later rounds. You can also pick up a weapon off the ground and use it as well (unless you've set the rules to restrict such things). You'll keep the weapon from round to round until you die. Its a nice system. It is a great game dynamic with good maps that have the right amount of side paths and choke points to cover. The maps are small enough where there will always be some sort of action happening, but large enough where the action can happen at places you aren't. There is no single player campaign, but you can play maps on your own with bots that have difficulty levels. You can even jump into a bot if you die since there is no respawn until the next round. You'll notice the easy bots take their time to shoot you as well as you can tell watching them they intentionally don't aim directly at you. This is PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS to pick up and play, but of course the bots get more difficult. The game makes headshots instant kills and goes more along the realism path where if you jump and shoot, you're less accurate. When you kneel and shoot you're more accurate. It's a fun game that fills a different niche than Team Fortress 2. Give it a try over a free weekend and its also dirt cheap.

review: Counter-Strike. The game that lives up to its name. So simple, yet so much fun. It could be considered the game that began competitive first-person shooters... Or at least to my knowledge, it is. And compared to the other Counter-Strike games, I gotta say... CS:GO was okay. Graphics are nice, old-school maps, and the new item drop system is a nice addition. But, now, the only reason I play it is because I'm playing it with a friend, or I just want a drop that I could sell, no matter how pathetic it would be, or I just wanna waste time. You would find it awesome at first. But, at some point, it didn't give me something CS 1.6 gave me, and still gives today - Thrill. I won't say it's bad. But, then again, your money's probably well-spent on this game on sale... Or well-spent on something else.

review: I believe that this game is not for everyone if you are going to play it competitively, and it's not like the other FPS games. We all know something about CoD, BF or any other FPS games like these, but CS has been more different since it requires a different talent.. and this is the best of those CS games ever! PROS; #1- I can easily say that the competition on matchmaking, the ranking system -which is only available on CS:GO- made this game is the best of the serie. #2- Weapon skins and the stickers for sure! They're making the game much more better! #3- The "Operation" events! They're selling access for these events and making so many maps and some bonus case drops whoever joins the operation events, and they're fun! - I think there're like 3 events already finished and one is still alive! CONS; #1- CHEATS! I really can't imagine how Valve can't stand against all these cheaters.. There are so many cheaters in this game like in every single FPS game. #2- BAD SERVERS! Not usually, but sometimes you lag too much, even disconnect because of bad servers. -CONS UPDATE FOR 64 TICK SERVERS! -VALVE NEEDS TO UPGRADE IT'S SERVERS TO 128TICK!

review: The greatest FPS I have ever played in my life. I used to think that the original Half-Life was, but since I tried Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, I think I've changed my mind for the better. It outdoes every other FPS in the industry in almost every single way. It's cheaper, it's easy to run on an average computer, and you are not required to pay for extra maps. I would recommend this game to someone who wants a fresh new FPS experience, while still feeling like they want an old FPS game's atmosphere and content. Who am I kidding? I would recommend this game to everyone!

review: One of the best competetive games I've ever played. You'll feel the difference if you're CS or CS:S fan. Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No useless perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes, no UAVs which look like a radar hack. This game is growing day by day. Valve made huge updates since the release of the game. The improvement they did made the game completely different. Probably worth more than its full price $15. It went for sell for less than 4$ in many sales. It's just a game that I don't mind paying $50 for it. I think Valve is getting loads of money just by the skins they're releasing every now and then. +10/10

review: Having played this game for 130 hours now, I feel that it is a worthy sequel to CS:S and 1.6 and I definitely recomend it to fans of CS. Some of its good points are that the weapon balance is definitely better than in earlier CS games; the deagle, m4, ak, and awp do not dominate the battlefield anymore, with Valve's matchmaking it is easier to get into your prefered gamemode, rather than navigate through the server browser; you simply click on the gamemode of choice and click "go", the experience feels more focused on tactics rather than gunplay compared to other games of this genre, and is one of the most popular games on Steam, meaning that you should have no problems getting into servers. The biggest con for me is that the valve matchmaking servers run on 64 ticks per second, which can lead to some head-scratching with some kills, and some missed shots when you clearly should have hit. Another con for some people is that this game is quite difficult if you have no prior experience in Counter-Strike. All in all, if you desire a gameplay experience that is fast paced, but more tactical than competing FPS games than this is the game for you.

review: Hello everybody! Ever wondered what Counter-strike was? Well let me tell you! :) Counter-Strike is a FPS, a team based game where you either go for a defuse mission or something like a deathmatch, let me explain. -- Defuse mission: 2 teams on opposing sides, the Counter-Terrorists, and the Terrorists. The "CTs" defends the different BOMB sites, A and B and the "Ts" have the job to infiltrate the "CTs" defence and plant the bomb on either of these sites. Of course there's more to this. You start off with 800$, enough to buy a new Pistol or defuse kit or an kevlar[armor] (As CT). And on the terrorists side they have the oppertunity to buy a new pistol or kevlar as no Defuse kit is needed. (T) During the match you either earn money by winning or taking out enemies. And of course there's some money from losing but not as much. When every round ends there's a MVP ( Most Valuable Player ) star given out to the winning team, this is simply a "Good job" star and gives no benefits other than showing the enemies and teammates that you ROCK! There's a bunch of different maps but i can clearly say that "Dust 2" or in the old days "De_Dust_II" is the most favourable map and only has around a 20 second queue. In this "Gamemode" you don't respawn until the round ends. -- Deathmatch: You start as either CT or T and instantly get the oppertunity to pick weapons of your choice, you can go with the standard M4A4 and the pistol of your choice, or you could go for a more long-range option and try the AWP (Arctic Warfare Police) which is also known as the Magnum Sniper Rifle. Of course there's a lot of more options to choose from but that's up to you to find out! Deathmatch there's no spawn-timer and you will instantly get put back in the fight, this could be a bit messy but if you like madness, it's probably something for you! -- Of course there's more gamemodes but it's up to you to find out the different ones, i simply gave you the basic gamemodes which you probably will start on. -- Hopefully this gave you a humm what Counter-Strike is, This the very basics and there's a lot more to it, like tactical play, short burst fires and different call names for different areas, but it's up to you to find out and conquer Counter-strike. --- I myself love Counter-strike with an endless love, i've played cs 1.6, CS:s, CS:z, CS 1.5 and so on.. Of course it's been many accounts away since i played those and can't vouch that i did with this account, but i've been around on CS for a very long time, and i love it, the way every move you make. every shot you take makes a difference, either give your position away or wait and ambush, it's up to you! Can you handle it? This has been a review of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, by Emil Walter aka JesterHat. /Thank you for reading!

review: Ah, Counter Strike. It takes me back to to a hot summer day back in 2011 when i pirated half life one and this came with the bundle. Of course, it was 1.6... Well, needless to say i sucked more at this game than johnathan's mom, but i soon grew accustomed to it and then i came up upon this nifty program called steam. I bought it ( when i still had a cast) and i was disgusted by the difficulty but now i'm writing to you as a silver one and after a year or so, i call it progress. ( Dont insult my skills negur ill smoke you quicker than you got your hand in your ). Well, CS:GO is one of the best games i have ever played and my little "clique" seems to enjoy it too. The gameplay, guns, maps, and whetever else you want to name surpass my expectation. If you get this game, get it for the competitive, not casual. This game is subject to numerous updated for stupid stuff due to valve changing all the  we players complain about. Counter strike is a great way to work on teamwork and it will basiclly change your perception of a true "FPS". The weapons require knowledge on how to use them and they also require you to not be a little whiny girl over them. There are so many people who play and the newcomers understand it quick if they are committed to the game. I give it nine Monica lewenski  out of ten.

Some people might want to lure you in by saying "CoD's fer fukkin kids bra, thissis so realtik", but standing still and shooting (not aiming god forbid) a pixel is surprisingly not as fun as it may sound. This is so realistic that a grenade doesn't kill you and a flashbang makes the screen go white, which is racist. If you're to poor to buy CoD and you don't want to resort to prostitution, I recommend buying this 1999 mod, even though 4,99$ is a bit much for "Pixel Hunt Deluxe"

review: Once again, Valve never fails to deliver an epic title such as Counter Strike. For years, the Counter Strike community was divided into two titles: Counter Strike: 1.6 and Counter Strike: Source. But now thanks to Valve's latest Counter Strike adition, we can finally bring back the family all together. The addition of skins are all bonuses that make Counter Strike: Global Offensive even more enjoyable, following Team Fortress 2's hat and drop system. The money being used for E-sports for the best to take place in. The competitive rank system that finally matches players equally based in terms of skill and tactic, as well as giving you the prestige for winning. The game is not perfect, but then again no game is. But what seperates most games from this one is the fact that the beloved developers of Hidden Path Entertainment are always listening to the fans while working together with the top players to try to achieve the perfect gameplay (although there are many features that could be similar to DOTA 2 to make it even better, but Valve will learn soon). Thanks to this game more and more people are joining the community of this game and we should all work so that this game, or should I say franchise becomes the best First Person Shooter series EVER!

review: Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.

review: I'll just be straight-forward with this; this game is for ones who enjoy FPS, Counter-Strike games, and PvP. If you are one that doesnt enjoy those things then this game isn't for you. You will be faced with a lot of frustration and will regret purchasing this game. Now for those that do enjoy those things stated before, this game has better graphics than the previous CS games, intense competitive FPS matches, remakes of nostaligic classic CS maps, and new fun casual game modes like arms race. So yes, I will recommend this game, for those that love FPS.

Btw, there is also a new game mode, demolution. If you want to play serious, you should get this instead of CSS. This game is worth the full price! 4.5/5

review: Command and Strike: Global Alert is a game. This turn-based, roleplaying game combimes stealth and action not too distant to the Assassin's Creed series. Unlike the Assassin's Creed series, however, this game doesn't mess around. A risky lack of story really pays off with the powerful emphasis on coopertative puzzle solving. I'd caution new players to the Call of Strike: Global Warfare series, as the steep learning curve is somewhat of a disservice to the overall experience. However, if you can get over that curvature with ease, the experience opens up a lot of interesting rpg elements not typically seen in a third person shooter. If you're looking for a similar feel to the antiquated versions of this game but with more refined visuals, there's no reason to not pick this up. I give this real-time strategy visual novel a Snow White out of a Disney Princess.

review: Counter-Strike is one of the biggest names in the PC gaming community, and for good reason: it revolutionized multiplayer FPS games. After the original CS hit shelves, along with 1.6 and Source, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has set the bar even higher, and jumped over it tenfold. Sticking close to it's roots, Global Offensive employs it's famous bomb defusal and hostage mission game modes (available in both "casual" and ranked 5v5 "competetive" types), along with integrating some other fun modes, such as arms race and deathmatch. Bomb and hostage scenarios are lead by a buying system, encouraging successful kills and objectives (like planting the bomb) to aid in buying gear in the next round. Players are required to use teamwork and tactics in order to come out on top against the enemy team, and winning a game gives a sense of satisfaction unlike any other first-person shooter game I've ever experienced. If you are expecting this game to be anything like Call of Duty or Battlefield, you will be sorely disappointed. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an excellent addition to the CS saga, and I strongly recommend picking it up and giving it a try.

review: A worthy update to Counter-Strike: Source, CS:GO improves upon tons of mechanics that were lack-luster, or made the game too easy to get good at in it's predecessor. I think it's clearly safe to say this game also removed the stain left in the professional Counter-Strike community after a few CAL judges made unnecessary bans to advance their teams through tournaments. It's already had almost two dozen torunaments with multiple professional 5-man teams that many may recognize from CS 1.6. This game made quick work to fix some things that were decidedly annoying in CS:S, one being the too-often consistent bullet patterns when not on a flat surface(e.g. jumping, surfing, et cetera.) Some guns have been removed(looking at you MP5, and M3.), although they have been given replacements, and are joined with other new weapons that make the game much more fresh, and keep things interesting. Overall, combining this with the skin updates that will now be regular, the game can even pay for itself within a few weeks! The features allowing you to download demos of your games, watch the pros and casual high ranks alike live, and tons of exclusives for watching tournaments not only brings up community morale, but increases the excitement of the game. You can also link your twitch account to make it all easier. Very cool. Community servers are surprisingly still full, and almost as numerous as the last 3 games, even though Competitive play has been enhanced with an ELO system, and ranks to go along with it. Like always, if you can get good at this game, you'll be good at any First Person Shooter, making it a key title to own and play. It brings a set of new graphics that are amazing to compare to the other CS games(nostlagia withstanding), made all the better because of Valve's typical work to offload Graphics Processing to the CPU when possible. For what it's worth, it hardly tolls even low-end GPUs like my current 525M, with maxed settings, and very high levels of Anti-Aliasing. I'm able to keep a minimum of 80 Frames Per Second, and average about 150. All in all, I'm pleased to say that I have over 600 hours sunk into this game, and am only about 200 hours off surpassing my CS:S playtime as of writing. Valve did an amazing job with this game, and I can't wait to see what it's successor in Source 2 will look like!

review: This game will bring you alot of fun and hours played, I've played the first counterstrike 7 years ago. I've been a Counter-Strike fan since I first tried it out. I've got a total of 4000 hours in total of all the counter-strike games combined over my 7 years of service. This game is alot of fun and the operations are really great! If you feel like you don't hit, either become a better player by training your aim and reaction, or you could switch from Valves standard 64 tick (64 updates per second) to a paid 128 tick server (Costs if you're gonna do it the pro way, some free servers for it in the server browser). This game is very cheap and on some sales (which is common), it can cost around 3. That's the price you sell one or two cases for, which drops very common! This game is updated and maintained alot. This is a very good game and I support it to 100%.

review: Great game, usually a one time fee of $15 but the past winter sale had it at $2.99/copy. Valve does have some work to do on this game, while other games have balancing issues and a crappy player base, this game is not so much affected by that so much as it is affected by the subpar servers. About 95% uptime, but when they go down you get a penalty for "leaving the match" and get banned from competitive servers. This may happen multiple times in a row, and an undeserving player may find themselves left with much rage and a 7 day ban.

review: Many years ago I was drafted for this war. I was in the most deadly battle you could think of. I had lost all hope of survival and my team was loseing left and right. Then in my darkest hour I saw something that inspired me to keep fighting. It was single chicken that ran by and then I was inspired to fight for my freedom and I died but then I came back into the world. I think the reason was because I had not completed what I had started, I had not shown honor to the chicken yet, but then I saw a group of chickens and thats when I saw the holy chicken the one that I had saw in my time of darkness and I talked to it and became friends with thy chicken. Soon 2 enemys saw me I was traped with no escape I only managed to kill one of them and thats when the other shot but then out of no where the holy chicken flew down and sacrificed his life so that I had time to kill the other and survive. I still think of this chicken today and how he could have left me to die...but he didnt. he sacrificed himself for me as I think of him I shed a single tear and remember the fun times we had. How on that day he changed my life and inspired me that there is still hope in this dark world. How things can get better. From that day I said to myself I will keep fighting, that I will make sure that his death was not in vain and to honor all chickens not just him! You can honor the holy chicken to. All you have to do is purchase this game and fight for the chicken and for what is right! 10/10 Would honor the chicken again.

It is the best multiplayer game ive ever played and is great for people with game sense on the fact that you know where people will be camping and you know where people will go. And it is also good for team tactics unlike some other FPS games where you just go round shooting people (Call Of Duty). 10/10 buy this game 100% worth it!!

review: I don't know what it is but CS:GO just never gets boring for me. I can play it for 20 hours straight, and I'll be loving every second of it. 440+ hrs on record in a 3 month duration and still loving it. Unlike Call of duty & Battlefield, this tactical FPS game is very unpredictable and gets hard on every rank level. I can say CS:GO is one of myaaa... you know, It's a style thing. Never liked the aug / galil so much till now. Ehh & inferno, mirage, nuke, dust and cache are all good maps. Don't queue on d2.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games i just wanna play all the time. This game is really good. The graphics are good, the gameplay are fun and the game modes are fantastic. I have been spending so much time on this wonderful game mode Competitive. Competitive is a mode where two teams are fighting against each other and the first team that wins 16 rounds win the match. You can play this game with your friends, you can play this game with yourself and you can play this game with strangers. I really don't get tired of this game, it keeps my mood up and if i don't know what to play i start CS:GO. If you don't already own this game you should be a shame because this is a MUST own. All in all you won't regret that you bought this game if you like FPS games, the CS series and games made by Valve. And here comes the best thing - Skins. You can buy several skins for your favorite guns. There is alot of skins + You get drops every week. These skins can be bought from the Community Market! Another review by Niko Bellic!

review: This has to be the best Matrix game Ive ever played. The Story: You play as yet another person who was awoken from the Matrix and rescued by a Zion ship. The entire game takes place during a very specific training simulation that every recruit that has to run before he can jack back into the Matrix again. The aim of this simulation is to familiarise the trainee with various weapons he can acquire as well as basic tactics employed by terrorists and counter terrorist forces. In addition, this simulation is good at building a sense of teamwork and trust between the crew and their operator (referred to as Strat Caller). The Gameplay: Of course, as we learned in the movies, most of these training simulations are far from perfect. Some of the code used in it has been written by people with no formal education and the rest was pirated from the Matrix itself. This is cause for many anomalies we can observe within the simulation, but some argue that these glitches help the player get that surreal experience of entering the Matrix after living in the waking world. Most of these are small things like weapon having the wrong magazine size, missing fire selectors, fresh magazines looking empty, wrong ammo types (AKM uses 7.39x30 lolwut?). None of these subtract from the core of this game, however: the tension of being the last one alive and having all eyes on you is addictive. This game is in many ways the opposite of what is sold on todays FPS market. While a lot of people are hyped and praise some developers for discovering the Jetpacks and high movement shooters of the late 90s, this game keep a slower, more tactical pace. The guns have massive amounts of recoil and any sort of movement can throw your accuracy out the window. This places weight on map awareness and positioning more than what you would find in your average FPS game. The learning curve is steep and it doesnt simply boil down to learning recoil patterns. A lot of the time, you can win engagements by simply having better crosshair placement or having better communication then the enemy. Knowing where the enemy is and what gun they are using can easily win you the round even if you are outnumbered. This game also challenges you in a very in-universe way. Sometimes, the game will place Agents on the enemy team which will have all the godlike abilities they have in the movie: they know where you are and they have perfect aim. This can be a frustrating experience for most, but nobody said bringing down an Agent is easy. The Graphics: They are serviceable. Not much to look at here, you can run this on a toaster. Just make sure you stay away from Vsync, you want this game to run at 200+ frames. It's also worth mentioning that this is so far one of the few games that run perfectly on nVidia's Dynamic Super Resolution feature as I haven't encountered any UI scaling issues. The performance impact was negligable for me. The Sound: There is a lot of room for improuvemt here. The guns sound very weak compared to titles like Battlefield 3 and 4. The AK reminds me of a high pressure nail gun. There seems to be a bug when it comes to the sound engine deciding on which channel to play a sound, as people walking to my left sound almost the same as people walking on my right. The final verdict: Grab it on a sale. Its a fun game to play with friends. Its also worth mentioning that it already paid for itself by giving me a bunch of boxes that I sold on the market place. I ended up using the money to buy a bunch of gun, which is also another addicting aspect of this game.

review: Ahh... One of my favorite games. I was never in to CS, I bought CS:S for the Garry's Mod content. And whenever I tried to play it, I would get destroyed, even by bots. I do admit I was terrible at the game, but it really never appealed to me. The day that I got CSGO I went into it with the same mentallity, and opened up a match of office with easy bots. Instantly I noticed the updated graphics, and it looks good to this day. I ran around for a bit and fired off a couple shots with my pistol, then a bot came to try and ruin my day. I fired at him rapidly with my handgun, and he actually died. If that would of been CS:S, my brain would of been merged with the wall and I would of been looking at the bots on my team walk into walls. Suprised with myself, I carried on and made it to the second round alive. I opened up the buy menu, to find out the MP5 had been replaced (rip neva 4get) with the MP7. I bought it and looked for some bots to murder, I managed to kill 2 of them before getting shot in the back with a shotgun. While I groaned at myself for dying and having to wait for the remaining bots to duke it out, I noticed that you could take control of the bots and play as them. I was very happy with this feature at the time, and I am still happy with it now. After getting used to the recoil and spray patterns, I saw a gametype called competive, and I applied to a match of it. It was on de_dust2, and I got a couple of kills by luck with my trusty MP7. I was amazed by how noob friendly the game was, and how it had matched me with people of similar skill levels. After that match, I decided to go again. And again. And again. If you are looking to get into a competive shooter that is mostly* skill based. get this game. Also it can go for really cheap in sales. Thanks for reading. -Pyro *the p90 exists

review: Way too balanced. Needs aim assist to help me feel pro, and the balance is so harsh- the game needs overpowered secondaries, needs pointless deathstreaks, needs OP killstreaks, and most importantly, stop making changes in the new versions of the games, but need to put more polygons. Stop putting in good maps by fans, put in terrible maps that looks like circles. Stop helping the community, make the game pay-to-win and put hats in it. lol If what you pay for is what you get, all the other first person shooters are overpriced. For 15$ you get a legendary game, for 60$ you get more polygons.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, aka "The Hate Machine", or also known as "Aortic Aneurysm Simulator 2012" is best described as a slow, steady descent into a blind, black-out madness fueled entirely by your desire to see your virtual rank increase. It is guaranteed that at the very least, 60% of your time spent playing this game will be comprised of spectating your 14 year old Russian non-English speaking teammates continually fling themselves into an Auto-Rifle oblivion barrage and blame you in their foul Slavic tongues for their resulting deaths.

review: It was an ordinary day of solo-queueing, and I had been on the winning team in Workout. We were winning 15-0, and the other team didn't even stand a chance. On the last round, we decided to do a knife only. I turned the corner, noticing a Terrorist come out from the other end. I notice a basketball on the ground, and I hit it. It rolls towards him. He hits it back. A CT joins in, and then a T, and another, until the entire server is playing soccer with the basketball. Ts are winning 3-2. We are all good sports, except for one dude. Xban@TIC64, with 2 kills and 3 assists. He gets frustrated. Yells in teamchat. Then the unthinkable happens. He pulls out a Negev. And holds down the trigger. Instantly, the air is fulled with hundreds of bullets. The Ts dive for cover, but it is too late. They fall one by one, running away with their knives out. The game ends. Counter-Terrorists win. Before the scoreboard comes up and people recieve items, someone on my team starts a votekick to kick Xban@TIC64. It goes through with 4 votes. He is kicked. I have top-scored, with 47 kills and 12 assists. Turning around to get a drink of water, I freeze when I hear the sound of me getting a drop. I turn around slowly, getting ready to face my item. I look at the monitor. I have gotten a Galil | Sage Spray.

review: On Counter-Strike: Global Offensive since the announcement lay a huge responsibility. After all, the continuation of the legendary series of online shooters , a fan is a vast community will not tolerate the slag or just serednyachkovoy game. Benefit , Valve and not the studio that dares to disappoint their fans. Two years later, the clockwise and 691 held in opposition to the special forces and terrorists , I can proudly say that CS: GO is really failed. Even more than . Before continuing my review , it is worth noting that the only worthwhile game mode and remains to this day a bomb clearance , ie confrontation 5x5 , 30 rounds of 1 min. 45 sec. , In which the attacker must detonate a bomb at certain points , and protection appropriate to allow this to happen. One of the major advantages is the fact that CS: GO this type of game ( with minor changes ) placed in a separate section of the menu called ' competitive mode ' . Introduced a system of titles that helps you find a match according to your skill. In CS 1.6 and CS: Source competitive mode by default absent and was available only on certain servers , specially tuned for this type of game. The gameplay is not changed . Actually , nothing changed and is not required , a familiar mechanic works on hurray . Fixed characteristics of some weapons , something removed, something added to the overall picture it does not have nearly no effect. Shooting became more random, yes. But perhaps the most realistic FPS in the moment. If multiplayer shooter from you wait not fancy graphics and ballistics believable and interesting gameplay, then welcome to the CS: GO. Valve managed to make an almost perfect balance of gaming devices. With proper skill you can neutralize the enemy with a much more powerful weapon . Pistol rounds in CS: GO is not known to sink without a chance and an opportunity to take the round even with poor economies . But the most important advantage is the ratio of Valve to his fans . Almost every week there is a free upgrade , changing the gameplay for the better, in order to achieve a perfect balance . Approximately every six months out extensive additions cost 5-7 dollars with soccer fans cards that are available in the competitive mode. That's not counting skins for weapons that can get special opening drawers. In addition to all Valve maintains its competitive community , sponsoring tournaments large sums . And I am delighted that the number of people playing CS: GO, is increasing every day . But on the other hand it is the community CS was for me the only problem in this game. Because it often turns into a competitive mode into a farce and mutual humiliation. The only solution - only play with friends. Total we have a great continuation of one of the greatest franchises in history. To purchase required if gaming is important to you the gameplay itself . Best multiplayer shooter at this point, in my opinion. - beardATTACK @ fren

review: Focusing on the quality of servers, my experience has been a 5/10 satisfaction with them. Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and "var", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just "bad" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012.

review: Dear, Guy Who Just Quit League of Legend/ Dota Ok i get it you hated being stuck in your elo because your teammates constantly trolled you or threw your promo games and you wanted something new to play with a better community. I'm sorry to be the one to inform you all those same trolls play this game as well and as an added Gaben in your face this game has Hackers out the . All that aside Counter Strike has been one of the greatest FPS consistently throughout our lifetimes and we cant blame them for humanity, we can call them greedy as the skin system in this game was left to the peoples to decide and some conspiracy theories later we end up with digital skins that are worth more than some peoples cars, and you know Gaben is taking that 10% of all market transactions. But if you can avoid the hackers and mute the trolls it is possible to solo carry yourself out of Silver (This games version of Bronze) and make it to Nova where you should find simi skilled players that can communicate with you to a moderate degree about Dust II, BEFRIEND these noble gentleman as they are crucial to making it out of Nova! After that its all Hackers, GE Smurfs, Semi Pros and Streamers i suggest looking into alternative matchmaking prospects to hon your skills such as ESEA, CEVO or FaceiT. Good luck my friend i hope to see you on the sands of Dust soon may Gaben be with you always! Jove_Gaming

review: In Counter-Strike:GO you play as Tom Clancy's younger brother; Al Clancy. Growing up Tom gave Al a hard time ruffling his hair and calling him names such as "weird Al" Barbara and John Clancy brought up these two whiper snappers in the state of ohio in the USA. They were a middle class family. When Al turned 7 his mum and dad bought him a pair of Night Vision goggles for Christmas. Tom being the the young nipper scallion he was decided it was a good idea to steal these as they were proper flipping oreyt. The sense of achievment Tom got when he stole these glasses was second to none, it didnt take long for tom to get addicted to ruining christmas. (fun fact, the grinch is loosely based on this story.) As they grew older it became clear that all tom and his football friends wanted to do was ruin christmas, They called themselves Christerrorists. This new movement led to the boys seeing a darker side of themselves, they began finding care packages santa had dropped for deprived children and strapping C4 on them. The ultimate way to ruin Christmas. Al was enraged when he became aware of this, he did the only thing a right wing father of 3 christmas loving American could do in this situation... Bought a metric sh**t tonne of guns and grenades. He began handing these out to friends and neighboors on his cul de sac. They soon became The Count Christerroists. The game is purely story mode. With this special addition you play as both Christerroists and Counter Christerrorists, in a sort of heads to head. (!!!!!!!!spoilers the story gets a little confusing as it is mainly about how many quick scopes you can do with the AWP and standing at Mid With bomb while your team clear a plant site and then losing the game) I dont want to give too much away so I will leave this review here, I hope you found it helpful. I would rate this game a 7/10 it could get a 9 but due to it being a christmas game I can only play around the festive time of year otherwise it seems a little silly. Like when you here Fairy Tale of new york by the pogues in august. It just doesnt feel right.

review: CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.

review: The mechanics in this game are off for the most part: Movement is imprecise, tagging is almost not existing, weapons are way too accurate when moving, weapon balancing is bad (P250 + 5/7 are OP, P90), timings in matchmaking are wrong, matchmaking servers are REALLY bad, hitreg is bad even on a decent server (crouching + jumping - check youtube) and in general this game is designed for casuals while it claims to be a competitive title. CS:GO is no match for previous iterations of CS. Sadly.

review: Quoted the "OK! Let's Go!" prolog that started every single round that all shooter fans from the 90s are familiar with. CS:GO is the latest edition to the one of the most well known and played shooter game through out the history of the world - the Counter-Strike franchise. And just like the Counter-Strike back then more than a decade ago was never about fancy features, stunning graphic, or special effects. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is about the good old classic gameplay but revamped, polished and improved such as gameplay balances, animation, interface, presentation, audios and visuals, then powered by the modern systems and technologies to keep this franchise up-tp-date with the flow of time. However, CS:GO is not Counter-Strike 2 or the Counter-Strike: Source that merely replaced the engine and optimized a bit on top of it, but a better, newer and more advanced edition to the series which can shine its veteran brand that was left untouched in the last 13 years. I recommend this game to those newcomers who wonder how the shooter game back then was played and interested to give it a try as well as a definite must buy to the old players who have been playing shooters before the terms like "ADS, or Aiming Down the Sight, which also known as Iron Sighting" was invented. Q1: What can I expect as a player who never played a shooter without aiming simulation before? A1: You'll notice dropping an opponent is no longer as simple as counting one to two, meaning right click to aim and left click to pull the trigger. You'll also need to hone not only your aiming skills, but also how you fire your weapon, especially the timing in order to synergize the hitting pattern of your weapon on to your target. In simple words, things just got more difficult in a somewhat inhuman way. Q2: What else? A2-1: Counter-Strike has a lot of depths in how you move, how you aim, how you fire your weapon and even how you approach the position you have in mind after a new round started, and that's not the end of it. A2-2: It uses dedlicate server, server browser, and match-making. It focuses in a delicate scale of combat where players will play the game through a 5v5 scale by standard default. Custom scales ranging from 8v8 to 16v16 is supported depending on the actual server-side setting of the server you were connected into. A2-3: Given that there is hardly a cheap easy kill for players, there is no health regen, and it took quite some study and patience to get things started - Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a renewal of a classic way of how players used to play shooter games, a harsh (or perhaps just like I said, inhuman) shooter game by today's standard for average players. Sum: If you neither a old timer or a newcomer who really interested in the old, classic, proven way to play a shooter game, then there won't be any particular reason I should recommend you to get this game with the only exception being you're sicked and tired how easy today's shooter games are like.

review: Ready to play a REAL FPS? This isn't you run of the mill kiddie 360xXNoScopeXxQuickscope dropshot game, your skill doesn't depend on scopes or grips, heartbeat sensors or noob tubes, this game is all about gaining personal skill. Your improvement and developement as a player will depend on your willingness to learn and devote time to learning "strats" to improve your gameplay as a team, or as a solo player. You will practice smokes and flash grenade spots for hours to use in competitive matches, sit in aim maps and perfect your reactions and headshots. Just because someone happens to get a lucky headshot on you, or is steamrolling you in competitive doesn't make them a hacker, they are simply out-playing you, and you need to adapt to that. You will need to be able to read your enemies movements, placement, and gameplay to continue to dominate in competitive, and this all comes with practice and time playing. You're not going to jump into this game playing like a pro, you will start from the bottom just how everyone else has, and work your way up as you develop a better feel for the game as a whole. 10/10 r.i.p. social life

review: This game is a 10/10 game. The only way to win is through means of communication which include a social aspect of the game. Aim is an important aspect of this game too. If you're a terrible shot, just don't play competitive.

review: Currently my favourite game on Steam. I know that some FPS games get old and that they are not for everyone but this one I have yet to get bored of playing. Playing countless hours of competitive with friends is where the majority of the fun is to be had, this game in general has a good community. Even casual can be fun, the Operations that release always have new and interesting changes to the game that do not just include the maps that come with them. I would highly recommend this game to anyone to play, even just casually the game can be a great experience. Pros: Insanely fun with friends to play Competitive Matchmaking or casually. This game has made me a better player at everything I play so it can for you too. Lots of community created games, maps, weapon skins, stickers, etc. (Some even added to the game by Valve) The game matches you at your skill level for Competitive Matchmaking so you always play against people of around equal skill. The item drop system in the game allows players to receive weapon skins or cases that you can use or open. The steam market is a great tool for this game as a lot of the in game items (Cases, stickers, skins, knives) are listed there for you to buy and sell. Cons: There can be at times quite a lot of hackers that want to ruin the experience of others, especially in Competitive Matchmaking. The game can be frustrating at times if you do not do well during games or play with people that don't care about others/don't communicate. Good luck with case openings you have a pretty low chance to get anything good, personally though I have gotten pretty lucky so anything is possible. The game can require a lot of effort if you play Competitively so know what you are getting into.

review: It's important to appreciate games like this for what they are, and this game is a callback to a past chapter of video game history that's been buffed and polished. And unfortunately as someone who never actually played the original Counter-Strike games, I'm not in much of a position to judge exactly how well they pulled this off. Basically, it entirely boils down to the kind of person you are. If you're a die-hard Counter-Strike fan, then this is probably all you can ask for. If you're a more typical gamer who just finished playing Crysis or Battlefield and wants to pick up something to play over the weekend, then trust me when I say that this is NOT the game for you. It's the online FPS equivilent of Dark Souls, in a way.

review: I've spent exactly 1.2k hours playing this game in all my accounts , i've found that this game is the best FPS game you can ever play. And here's why : First of all , you need some skills to play this game correctly , and when you get enough skills , you'll get more fun and more fun! Second , if you play this game with your friends , you'll get into it faster than playing SOLO , so its more fun with your friends instead of playing with randoms , then u'll try to be more better especially if you find a decent mates-team that plays with you , you'll start looking for some strats , then you'll play it more like serious. Third , for graphics , i dont really care about any game's graphics when its fun , but CS:GO's graphics are decent so there is no reason to complain about it. 4th , its gameplay , that every COD player complains about it. especially 'recoil' its really hard to control it but that's the the game you need to practice with your recoil , and try to find out the best settings you can play with. And there is alot of good things about this amazing game but sadly i cannot write them all in one review . And there is some bad things about this game , like after every update some people start getting some weird lags , i think they need to fix it , and if you're looking to play this game more serious , dont play on MatchMaking servers , because its full of R_E_T_A_R_D_S and alot of trolls and its a land of AFKs , thats just made me feel mad , just go on esea , esl , leetway and so on , and one more thing , and its after about every steam sale , CS:GO become a land of cheaters , and thats just redicouless. The reason why I'm not playing much lately because I need to focus on better life decisions and many important things. Finally i hope you find this review a helpful review and thanks for reading.

review: We're talking about the absolute TITAN in classic competitive first person shooters. The FATHER of addictive multiplayer combat set in a contemporary universe. Before Call of Duty. Before Battlefield. Before anything else that hefts up an AK-47 and and pulls back the charging handle... This did it first. And in many ways, it still does it best. I've met incredible people here. Some of the best friends of my life are actually from this. I've had incredible moments in this game. I've had laughter, moments of triumph, situations to overcome, comradery that I cannot even begin to describe, and a feeling of satisfaction that nothing else for $14.99 can come close to. (Short of a roadside BJ from your locals finest.) Nothing compares to the sharp, precise aim, the satisfying and punchy weapon bob... The sexy, sharpened and modernized gun models, crisp anti-aliased graphics running on a mature and tight version of Source... And the fact that this entirely new looking package is wrapped around the SAME hardcore game that 1.6 popularized way-back when, albeit with a few tweaks between all of the versions, means that it has a whole other layer that Battlefield, and Call of Duty can NEVER touch. "What is that 'layer' you speak of" you say? Many things, and the fact that I can SEE this clearly without ever stepping into the beating heart of CS:GO - competetive [At the time of this posting finally with no text limit, I have finally played 5 rounds of comp. 3 wins! It is a whole other amazing side to the game] is an achievement regarding the message this game wants to send its playerbase. - It's all about the community. It's all about a skill that needs to be HONED, not unlocked. It's about playing for HOURS and perfecting that single shot down that hallway. It's a game that stands perfectly on its own as a shooter, but manages to weave the MLG aspect into it seamlessly, without, in MY opinion... Dividing its playerbase. It's all there, all the time. A feeling of professionalism can wash over ANYONE in this game at least ONCE in their time with it. I can NOT say that about Source, or 1.6. Those were daunting, trudging beasts... Leviathans that I feel newcomers could not make headway in if they just wanted to have some fun and see what all the fuss is about. With the slight exception of Source. My time with that title was a mixed bag. Its graphics felt disjointed, and decidedly a mod, which is perfectly acceptable (duh)... But its shooting seemed almost RANDOM... And many 1.6 purists will say similar regarding not being able to enjoy the ballistics. The fact is that Counter Strike is often all about the MLG nowadays. And yet this entry in the franchise can stand on its own as a FUN game to just mess around in without feeling the pressure.... It is something to truly behold for ANY PC gamer. Being able to enjoy the hardcore without BEING hardcore is a treat. As you get better, the progression of your skill as a gamer feels tangible. You do NOT need unlocks, and idiotic modifiers to your gear to feel like you are getting anywhere. NOTHING gets in the way of your skill. No unlocks, no killstreaks, no aiming down sights... It's just you, your gun, your knife, and your ability to  UP the opposition. NOTHING else. It is such a worthy game that within a year of its release I'd been able to put over 350 hours into it, and I feel like more time could have been spent within its corridors, its rooftops, backrooms, and its long, stressful hallways. The feeling of PERSONAL progression and satisfaction I felt made me say left and right that I wished they'd add some kind of personalization, and a smart system that makes you MORE addicted. Not hats, just some way to make you give back to yourself in a meaningful way. A customization and unlock system for vanity gear would be fantastic, a new horizon for the game. It makes the game feel timeless, and without need of many other entries for some time, just updates for polish. And? Valve always listens. It's not PERFECT, but the skins add a new breath of air to the game. Even if you're not good, you're still the snob with that purple tier weapon, and everyone hates you. And they should. It's ok to hate on it just as much as it's ok to use these new pieces of bling. Everyone is doing it. And to speak of content? Valve games main strength has always been community based content that keeps your game living and breathing. Never slipping into the pile of "used up." There's always more to play with.... And now with the integrated workshop, and official server support for TOP map creations...(if you donate to both Valve and the makers, a hugely smart way for Valve to make money in a less greedy way than map packs). You can be assured that CS:GO has a lot more than just the addicting gameplay, community, the entertaining MLG scene, and most importantly self growth to keep you coming back thanks to these additions. The Arms Deal Update has its hand on your wallet, but through means of community driven sales, not just ones from the company... And NONE of it EVER affects your skill... Unless that purple SSG 552 fills you with divine rage that you just can't help but get headshot fever. you can make some decent digital goods money, and so can everyone else. I so no issue regarding this update, and thankfully after some weeks of growing pains, it seems everyone is on the same page. Intense firefights. Room for skill growth. The ABILITY (good luck) to have incredible social interactions.. Hilarious conversations. Things that I'll never forget. Especially thanks to the people I'd managed to call my best friends from this. Those are all the luck of the draw. But when you buy this game, one thing is for sure- You're buying a piece of gaming history with the freshest breath of fresh air I've ever seen. And it is a triumph.

review: A Review Mostly for me so I know Ive completed the story, high game time as well as feedback on the game. My Thoughts:- A team based FPS CT Vs T can be fun with a bunch of friends and the competitive mode is good fun, with weapon skins and team colours as well as a few good modes to pick from like death match, arms race, casual and some more. Achievements:- 156 of 167 (93%) Achievement Graphics:- An improvement on the last Counter Strike: Source game but nothing too special. Game Play:- Team Based type game where you have to rescue hostages or defuse a bomb. The aiming can take some time to get used to as when you go full auto with weapons you have to follow the bullets and not the crosshair. Story:- N/A Replayability:- Can become addictive if you play with friends or competitive What Could Be Added:- Different player skins/ colours Rating:- 9/10

review: After 250 hours of intense gameplay I learned the meaning of life. I play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive every day. I have not gone a day without Counter-Strike since I first bought it on the Steam store. However I do not like the gameplay of Counter-Strike in any way at all. The game itself is complete trash and was probably developed by the same people who made the first tentacle gang bang video but there is a golden egg among the pile of crap this game is. The chickens. I follow them with my default knife around Inferno, recording their every step with NVIDIA Shadowplay (batteries not included) and counting each individual chicken I spot and add it to THE LIST. The chickens are pretty, simple and flawless. They do not make my frame rate go down (I run CS:GO on the potato from Portal 2) unlike Skyrim's chickens and they explode if they are killed. I have only seen one chicken ever explode and that was in a competetive game in which xKittenfall, my rival, on the terrorist's team slaughtered one in front of my eyes with his Karambit Fade knife. I now suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and kill anyone who comes near my chickens. They are only for me. Do not harm my chickens. Anyone who even bats an eye at one of my precious birds will take an AWP headshot to the foot- be it friend or foe. I fear for the safety of these chickens. They are why I live. I was created by the Chicken God in order to protect the godlike chickens. Chickens are the meaning of life and if you attempt to argue with me I will shoot you until you're dead. Right in the foot. With a Glock-18 (ultra overpowered TBH). Do not mess with my chickens. And if you come across me in a session... Oh wait, you won't, because I swore off multiplayer after people killed the chickens. I only play in Bot Only sessions by myself and kick the bots, following the chickens around and hoping they do something new. I have studied the chickens so well I have memorized all of their spawnpoints on Inferno. There are 14 that spawn on the map and I am obsessed with them. Stay away from my chickens. (PART 2- THE 800 HOUR BENCHMARK) I whip around the corner and 1 tap flusha. The crowd goes wild with excitement. I just won the ESEA tournament for my new team Symbiotic. Confetti falls around me and LED lights illuminate the entire gaming stadium. I won one million dollars for the squad. I began screaming as my team carried me out of the stadium back to the gaming house. When night came I began to work on Source SDK, my life's new legacy. For a month I had been working on an ingame dream home that was secluded from the world and had no guns. It had a back yard exclusive to chickens and a statue in the living room dedicated to chickens. I smiled as I looked over the entire map and began adding more props and chickens to make the house more lively. I looked at each individual chicken to make sure t were on point and ready to be presented in the map. When I finally upload the map on the workshop people will be able to view my amazing home. It is on and island in the middle of the ocean with a home on it. The chickens are safe from all harms in the entire world. The map consists of three skyboxes; The house & island, compiling skybox & the easter egg skybox which can be teleported to through a secret trigger_teleport. In the secret skybox is a race track dedicated to bringing back func_vehicle 2012. Valve did not include func_vehicle (from Source) in CSGO and it angered many mapmakers. They could not make drivable cars in our beloved Counter-Strike? What a scumbag move. We need to bring back func_vehicle to the Counter-Strike series in order to improve our community as a whole. Can we do this? I love chickens and balance the life between competetive gameplay and chicken worshipping on a secluded island. Thank you for considering The Message by Nas.

review: Didn't catch my interest during my first test, Probably due to having hardly any skill compared to those who had gotten used to it over time making me question my ability as a fps'er. Few months after uninstalling it, I jumped in the deep end & came out riding a dolphin with starfish tickling my toes. Same perks & cons as you'd remember from Source & 1.6, Awps, Pistol snipes & pre-aiming/firing s that have inspected every grain of dirt on each map. Still holds the crown for plain and simple team based FPS. Also the occasional "OMFG YOU HACKER F*GGET, SIF YOU KNEW WHERE I WAS"

Game developers who will screw you sideways just for an extra penny? Well look no further as this is the game for you! I strongly recommend this game if you are trying to lose some calories. The intense rage will end up driving you crazy enough for you to start smashing some skulls in. Some might label this as the best addition to the CS franchise - I simply cannot disagree! This masterpiece will take over all of your free time, family time, masturbation time, and eventually your whole life!

review: CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.

review: A great shooter in comparrison for others in the same genre, CSGO relies on a know-how- basis on how to aim and control your firing, aswell as the differnce among each weapon. The fourth game in the CS series (If you rule out the japanese ones), CSGO is quickly described as an updated CSS but with much better graphics, animations, more content aswell as a whole new shooting system. There are alot of old weapons from the previous games, though all having their different stats changed to suit CSGO's new system. 8 new weapons are introduced aswell, some replacing previous ones from the other games. As for playable characters, CSGO has a whole new layout. Previous CS games had 4 (CSCZ 5) characters to choose from after selecting a team. This isn't the case with CSGO, here you are forced to be one out of 5 almost identical characters from a certain faction. As an example, anarchists, all sharing the same model, but wearing different masks and small details. Several previous factions, like the phoenix connexion, return, though not all, like the arctic avengers. While the increase of factions has made CSGO interesting to play, sadly since its launch 2 years ago, the game has yet to have seen any new added factions. Visually the whole game feels more down to earth and realistic. The default maps are plenty, and several old maps from previous games return, including Aztec, office, vertigo, dust maps among others. Something new in this CS game that wasn't in previous games, is weapon skins. The idea coming from Team Fortress 2, you have a chance of getting item drops at the end of each game. It could be a weapon skin or a case (TF2's version being the crate). Using a skin will replace the default weapon's looks. You can trade or sell these weapon skins and cases over the steam market, or buy from the market itself with real currency. This CS game also introduces competetive play. Searching for a match, you are teamed up with 4 other random players to fight against 5 other players on the opposing team. Playing 15 rounds in total. Each time you win, you get closer to getting a better rank. Same goes if you lose a match, you get closer to getting your rank decreased. Usually with this rank system, you are played against and with players on the same rank. Almost. It is a common thing that you face against players near your rank. Rarely ever exactly the same rank. You can also play with friends, despite their rank being either lower or better than yours. This leads to a very unbalanced rank system that CSGO has. The community is by far the most negative thing about this CS game. It is very common for players to insult each other, making this community by far the worst of all gaming communities in history, even exceeding the CoD communities. Be wary if you are very sensitive to insults. This community is also known for its scamming for weapon skins. Because of the high amounts some of the more rare items cost over the steam market, alot of scamming goes about with different ways to trick other players into giving their weapons for free or lesser priced skins. Valve has stated they won't be able to help you if you get tricked. The most common trick is a random user on steam adding you, then sending you a link if you add them. If you press on this link, you risk getting a virus that will take over your account. Overall this CS game is worth every cent. But be wary of its community.

review: A very complex gunplay system makes for extremely realalistic fire fights. its a change of pace from BF3/4 and COD but it requires more skill to play then ether of these games, this will lead to a higher tiers of playing. Although the ranking syatem needs an overhaul for the competitive mode as it is based on wins and not individual score this can often lead to mis ranking you to lover or jigher tiers. 8.5/10

review: I definitely reccommend this game. It is by far one of the most fun fps's I have come upon. Gameplay is very simple, there are different types of gamemodes with different objectives. Additionally, the variety of maps also makes the game more unique, simply because of the different secret and strategical locations there are. You won't be meeting any cod fanboys in this game because it is simply class, however a recent change made a few guns have scopes similar to COD gun scopes. Guns and all equipment is very well balanced allowing for a fair environment. Counter-Strike Global Offensive simply brings a sense of real fps. No healing, no medics just guns and people trying to shoot other people.

So basically i mainly used auto-p90 which pretty sure every silver did to! next 7 month your going to be an MG-MGE- If you go try hard then ur main gun is ak - awp , then after 1-2 years you will see your self making a team and making such nice good friends online! This game is the best guys! you need to get it for who ever doesn't have it! ~Cheers.

review: It may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps (Assault, anyone?), and little features of past games, but Global Offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking Counter-Strike for whoever wants it. Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.

review: I must admit, Valve is doing great job in making this game, with beautiful updated Source engine, everything looks more & more great even to CS:S. In addition of that, CS:GO added several new CT & Terrorist factions, new weapons & equipments, also there's customized weapons skins & many, many things have changed. Totally a must have for Valve & CS series fans. 10/10

However it has a vey big learning curve. For the first 50 hours or so you won't be very good at the game. As long as you get decent skill after that, you will have alot more fun.

review: This is an excellent first person shooter that takes time to get used to, it's not your average Call of Duty or Battlefield. You don't frag people for some random scope for your rifle or a suppressor, instead you are trying to master out the legendary weapons that have been in all CS titles. The AK-47, the M4 and the AWP. These are the quite important ones, and the way to go.

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

This mode is pretty nice when you're having a competition with other players . But if you don't wanna get serious playing you can play casual there are many noobs there seriously but sometimes there're so much players and i don't wanna play with them cause i can't kill anyone :( lol , Anyway there're many funny guys on casual so if you wanna play for fun you can play casual but don't get serious on it cause it's not competition it's just play for fun though. Hope this Guide helps :) See ya.

review: CS:GO is a game you love to hate. Its hard to get into if you havent played any of the previous series making it challenging for new players. For those entering CS:GO for the first time, I'm giving my apology in advance because you are going to get some verbal abuse from some players. Here are some tips on how to avoid these verbal abuses and maybe gain some respect from the older more experienced players and in return become a better player Tip 1: Do not camp in spawn, everybody hates that Tip 2: Using the AUG or SG and camping will increase your chances of someone yelling at you and calling you a scrub turbo nerd. Tip 3: Autosnipers. Wins games yes but really you can win with other guns. Tip 4: Try not to run and shoot at the same time. It works but your chances of getting a kill are slim unless you rush with a Negev...in tunnels... Tip 5: If you are having a hard time learning the mechanics of the game, watch some videos, learn from the best, its how I learnt. Even though I still can't aim with an AK it doesnt hurt to learn. Tip 6: If you are on either on CT or T side, make sure you know what your team objective is. If you are playing T on a defuse map and it's on Dust 2, please for the love of god please, try to plant the bomb and move with your team. I've seen to many bomb carriers jerking off doing their own thing and end up dead, while the rest of the team is half way across the map. If you don't have the bomb, then try to protect him. Your objective is to plant the bomb. Not AWP down mid and try to get the sickest pick of 2014. This tip also applies to Hostages. Tip 7: Game modes like casual and competitive are a great way to switch game play. Casual is great if you want to just want to have fun like zeus rushing stairs or Mac 10 rush garry in Office and is good for newcomers. competitive is very different, if you are new try to avoid competitive until you have a firm grasp on the overall CS:GO game. But if you are the type of #YOLO kind of person and just wants to jump into a compeitive match go ahead but you might get vote kicked and be called names who've never ever even heard off. I'm pretty sure the saying Turbo Nerd was introduced to me in CS:GO. For those who have clocked on triple digit hours on this game. How good is getting a deagle headshot? If somehow feels really right. Anyways those who are experienced in CS:GO and any counter strike of the counter strike games, in my opinion this game hits the headshot when it comes to first person shooters. Over time we've seen this series evolve through daily updates, hotfixes and patches that make the game more enjoyable for those experienced players ( expect the aim down sight for AUG's and SG's, why did they try to fix something that wasnt even broken?) Playing with friends is just more enjoyable and an important factor on why CS:GO is still big. Here is a list of sayings me, my friends and some of the CS:GO community have made while playing CS:GO "This franchise is to big for me" (Getting killed by an AUG or SG) "CYA MATEEEEEEEEEE" (Shooting someone in the face who pissed you off in the pervious round) "SIT DOWN SON" (When someone gets shot by a deagle in the head while moving) "F^$K THIS GAME!" (Opening a case and it just slowly moves past a Statrak M4 Asiimov) "GET REKT" (Getting a kill on someone who has been dominating you for the past 6 rounds.) "Freaking turbo nerd" (When the other player has outskilled you and killed you) "Holy crap, Australian players" (Is a term for crap or not so skillful players) "Of course I get shot from skylights" (Those have who know what I'm talking about you know whats up. Pun intended.) "GG fagget" (Is when some mic spamming  wins the match because his been trashing talking and making himself top gun.) "Get good scrub" ( Again, killing someone who's pissed you off in the previous round) "Nice ghosting" (When a player gets mad because you and your clan are on top of the team) "*insert username* is hacking! (Thats when you've become that good at CS:GO that people think you are hacking but really, you've mastered how you like your crosshair, you've mastered every inch of the map, knowing almost every camping spot or spot that someone might be in, you've mastered the skill of the AK, and lastly mastered the art strafing while firing.) In conclusion, get this game because it's the only game that makes you so damn freaking mad but you can't help but return to it. Almost like dark souls but the end game for CS:GO is the sudden realization of spending $1000+ in opening cases and buying weapon skins and during the entire period of playing CS:GO, you could have saved up to buy a new car or a new house, and the money you have spent opening cases during your CS:GO time...you could have actually bought yourself a statrak knife....Good one.

review: A worthy update to Counter-Strike: Source, CS:GO improves upon tons of mechanics that were lack-luster, or made the game too easy to get good at in it's predecessor. I think it's clearly safe to say this game also removed the stain left in the professional Counter-Strike community after a few CAL judges made unnecessary bans to advance their teams through tournaments. It's already had almost two dozen torunaments with multiple professional 5-man teams that many may recognize from CS 1.6. This game made quick work to fix some things that were decidedly annoying in CS:S, one being the too-often consistent bullet patterns when not on a flat surface(e.g. jumping, surfing, et cetera.) Some guns have been removed(looking at you MP5, and M3.), although they have been given replacements, and are joined with other new weapons that make the game much more fresh, and keep things interesting. Overall, combining this with the skin updates that will now be regular, the game can even pay for itself within a few weeks! The features allowing you to download demos of your games, watch the pros and casual high ranks alike live, and tons of exclusives for watching tournaments not only brings up community morale, but increases the excitement of the game. You can also link your twitch account to make it all easier. Very cool. Community servers are surprisingly still full, and almost as numerous as the last 3 games, even though Competitive play has been enhanced with an ELO system, and ranks to go along with it. Like always, if you can get good at this game, you'll be good at any First Person Shooter, making it a key title to own and play. It brings a set of new graphics that are amazing to compare to the other CS games(nostlagia withstanding), made all the better because of Valve's typical work to offload Graphics Processing to the CPU when possible. For what it's worth, it hardly tolls even low-end GPUs like my current 525M, with maxed settings, and very high levels of Anti-Aliasing. I'm able to keep a minimum of 80 Frames Per Second, and average about 150. All in all, I'm pleased to say that I have over 600 hours sunk into this game, and am only about 200 hours off surpassing my CS:S playtime as of writing. Valve did an amazing job with this game, and I can't wait to see what it's successor in Source 2 will look like!

review: It may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps (Assault, anyone?), and little features of past games, but Global Offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking Counter-Strike for whoever wants it. Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.

review: I've been playing CS 1.6 since after its' release, hell i've been playing CS since the release of 1.5 even(Mainly on non-steam LAN tho, i must confess) and thus far this is probably the best. it has the smooth and proper aim of 1.5 for most part when it counts, the accuracy of pistols are absolutely nostalgic in it and all pistols are actually worth playing with now with the change in damages. when it comes to SMGs and Rifles it's much more similar to 1.6 in early days except for AK47, GOD knows how i missed the super-accurate AK47 from 1.6. It also makes more sense to play with Galil and Famas now. About the sniper, well...i've never used sniper when it was serious but an amazing sniper i knew got interested in this game after playing around with AWP and SSG for around 10minutes. Almost forgot about the Heavy group of loadout being muuuuch more fun to play now and how the shotguns aren't useless from more than 10meters away. The only thing which was abit harder to enjoy on this release was jumping. Harder than 1.6 but with much more of a...kinda...air-control, guess i should say. Might be annoying at first, but you'll surely enjoy it after getting used to it. On top of all those improvements, there are weapon skins now making it more fun for the casual players. Another thing worthy of mentioning would be netcode improvements. Since i've always played videogames with higher amounts of pingtime i've been more careful about that part. in CS:GO you get to search for servers with pings as high as 350ms! Now...it doesn't really sound good when said alone, but the netcode is done well enough to make sure it's still playable with such high latency(However you have to cover the high ping time with better and faster reflexes at the end again). On a last note, i really hope valve improves the source engine. A little bit prettier envirounment and characters while saving the simple-looking options wouldn't hurt.

Unlike Call of duty & Battlefield, this tactical FPS game is very unpredictable and gets hard on every rank level. I can say CS:GO is one of myaaa... you know, It's a style thing.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games i just wanna play all the time. This game is really good. The graphics are good, the gameplay are fun and the game modes are fantastic. I have been spending so much time on this wonderful game mode Competitive. Competitive is a mode where two teams are fighting against each other and the first team that wins 16 rounds win the match. You can play this game with your friends, you can play this game with yourself and you can play this game with strangers. I really don't get tired of this game, it keeps my mood up and if i don't know what to play i start CS:GO. If you don't already own this game you should be a shame because this is a MUST own. All in all you won't regret that you bought this game if you like FPS games, the CS series and games made by Valve. And here comes the best thing - Skins. You can buy several skins for your favorite guns. There is alot of skins + You get drops every week. These skins can be bought from the Community Market! Another review by Niko Bellic!

review: Do you like guns? Crates? Guns shooting at crates? Crates shooting at guns? If your answer is yes (or even if it's no), you're in luck! Valve has decided to create the next-gen version of their Counter-Strike franchise and added this great game to the fray! Play with friends, get yelled at for not playing a tactically-perfect manner during the eco round by twelve-year-olds! The gang's all here! Spend your life savings on Stat-trak versions of your favorite guns so you can brag about how many pubs you've "pwned" when you should have been working! A game so amazing and full of crates, you'll wonder why Valve even gives them away! Gabe, you've done it again!

review: Hands downt the best pure FPS on the Market. This is a staple for someone wanting to break into competitve gaming and wants to learn how tactics and teamplay is valued. You don't have to worry about leveling up or someone having a better gun then you or attachement, everyone has access to all the same guns making it a completely balanced game. It also offers a very enjoyable casual community and deathmatch for just having fun. Countless amounts of custom servers with addons and mods that add tons of variety to an already near perfect game. The game is constantly updated and improved upon by developers that actively listen to the community.

review: I stand there surveying the battlefield, full of my deceased comrades. During that time i had two things on my mind, one being that my fate determines on this moment, and that my AWP Redline looks intimidating with my newly added "Welcome to the Clutch" sticker. With that boost of confidence I ready myself for whatever comes next. I then instinctivly tap 'tab' to see what im going up against, and mutter under my breath, "Pshhh 1v3.... eZ." I then approach the bombsite where i come in sight of my prey. I stare the target down like a fat boy eyeing a stick of butter. Deciding to make my move I lick my finger, gathering as much saliva as possible, and cram it down the subjects ear. He screams in agonizing pain, and torture. I know I must finish him, so I grasp for his bloomers, and pull. Thus summoning an atomic wedgie which instantly incapacitates the man. Knowing what I have done I cannot help but tea bag the corspe a few times. Meanwhile I recieve a message stating that the bomb was planted. I suddenly stop the nonsense and move on to my next set of victims. Which were going to be tougher to crack than the first. I think of what I am going to do next, knowing I do not have much time, so I do what is best. I conjure my inner animal. Resulting to me being restrained to using the Deagle in a showy manner. I then come into sight of the bombsite, to abruptly run into my pursuers. My inner animal guides me toward my desiard location, and fires resulting in a collateral killing them both. In shock, I swiftly head towards the bomb knowing it will go off at any moment. But all worries fade when I am quickly informed by a gentleman on the opposing team, that F10 is a shortcut for instant defuse. Before executing the task, I mutter,"idiot." And spam the F10 key as fast as I can with my right index finger, overcome with joy I begin my victory chant to celebrate our win. But when I look back at my screen it reveals an EXACT copy of my desktop, that is INTERACTABLE. Holy cannoli, Valve you really did over due your self on this extrodinary easter egg. I really anticipate you guys adding more stuff like this easter egg in the future, never in my life have i seen so much detail be put into something so little.

review: What can I say, this game is made by Valve, therefore I am obligated to love it. In all honesty, this game is in some cases harder than other FPS's I've played, and in other cases easier. The community is large-I've yet to find a lobby that has less than 5 people in it. The game also runs on the Source engine, resulting in very attractive graphics that have a minimal impact on my GPU. Either way, I love this game and recommend it to anybody who is looking for a cheap, easy first person shooter.

review: ---------Sadly i have to edit my review-------------- Im playing this game now for just too long to understand the core thinking of the makers of the game. Sadly i have to give the game a thumbs up anyway because the thumbs up are maybe for the best 1st person shooting game of all time... i played them all fromcs begginings till now even COD, BF probably all versions till now. But i have to admitt all this games cannot top CS:GO. Cs is just a very fast, team oriented 1st person shooter that will pull you in and never let go... Atleast what i thought so till now... Now i have to come to the problem... and the problem is: --------------------------------------------------CHEATING--------------------------------------------------------------------- Since the game came out i knew there would be cheaters... It sadly now belongs to almost every online game there is... But this became different... Allredy at the beggining i was wondering about the price of the game ... found it kinda cheap for such a good game only 14 Euro or something... At that point i allready thougt that its kinda easy for cheaters to rebuy a new account even if they should get banned... But i could never ever even imagine that it gets even better untill i realized that its beeing sold atleast once a month for ca 3 Euro... I dont know if this is aa dream or a insult to all the players who want to play a clean game... i dont think i have to explain what consequences this had on cheating.... So because of that the complainments and reports pilled up and valve was searching for a solution that doesnt cost them a thing and they get the cheaters atleast a lil bit under controll... so they made OVERWATCH... now they dont have to pull a finger and they work is beeing done by slaves (Players) who are hoping on a cleaner game one day... Nice story but whats this the game costs 3 Euro again so this guy (Cheater) buys this time 6 accounts so he has resources now for atleast 4 months to play and cheat... This is getting out of control VALVE you are making allready big money with this Skins and Market stuff why in Gods name cant you spent some of the money for making the game more enjoyable where you bann those cheaters and get us ----------------128-tick------------ SERVERS----------!!!!!! If these arogant stance of yours wont change you will loose probably a lot of players... I am a very active player but i quited the game for almost 2 moths last year because of that...

Guns feel and sound powerful, classic maps mixed in with the new spice things up a little, and it's oh-so rewarding when you finally master that gun you've been trying so hard to get more equipped with. Pick it up if you're looking for a challenging-but-rewarding multiplayer shooter.

review: Always been a Counter-Strike fan, played them all and this is my favorite one by so far and this brought me back to the series after a long break. Absolutely love the competetive matchmaking to find players to almost equal skill level as you and the feature to party up with your friends and play a game (casual or competetive) with them. And the "new" game modes are also fun and the fact that you can search official CS servers and the community made ones. The game is good, but they need to buff the shotties a little bit (except the Mag-7) cause I'm tired of getting 80-98 damage point blank (espacially with the Nova)! Shotties are made to kill with one shot or medium damage with fast followup shots. :c (okay rant part is over) Summary: I love this game alrdy even tho only 70 hours in the bank, but it has its problems like every game out there. If you like fps games and/or Counter-Strike give this game a try and be brave and try out the competetive matchmaking too! :3

review: It was an ordinary day of solo-queueing, and I had been on the winning team in Workout. We were winning 15-0, and the other team didn't even stand a chance. On the last round, we decided to do a knife only. I turned the corner, noticing a Terrorist come out from the other end. I notice a basketball on the ground, and I hit it. It rolls towards him. He hits it back. A CT joins in, and then a T, and another, until the entire server is playing soccer with the basketball. Ts are winning 3-2. We are all good sports, except for one dude. Xban@TIC64, with 2 kills and 3 assists. He gets frustrated. Yells in teamchat. Then the unthinkable happens. He pulls out a Negev. And holds down the trigger. Instantly, the air is fulled with hundreds of bullets. The Ts dive for cover, but it is too late. They fall one by one, running away with their knives out. The game ends. Counter-Terrorists win. Before the scoreboard comes up and people recieve items, someone on my team starts a votekick to kick Xban@TIC64. It goes through with 4 votes. He is kicked. I have top-scored, with 47 kills and 12 assists. Turning around to get a drink of water, I freeze when I hear the sound of me getting a drop. I turn around slowly, getting ready to face my item. I look at the monitor. I have gotten a Galil | Sage Spray.

After I played Source quite much at my moms sisters husbands (I Know It's a long sentence XD) computer. Ever since that I've spent a lot of hours on source, and now when I discovered Global Offensive about a year or 2 ago I felt inlove again as the first time.

review: On Counter-Strike: Global Offensive since the announcement lay a huge responsibility. After all, the continuation of the legendary series of online shooters , a fan is a vast community will not tolerate the slag or just serednyachkovoy game. Benefit , Valve and not the studio that dares to disappoint their fans. Two years later, the clockwise and 691 held in opposition to the special forces and terrorists , I can proudly say that CS: GO is really failed. Even more than . Before continuing my review , it is worth noting that the only worthwhile game mode and remains to this day a bomb clearance , ie confrontation 5x5 , 30 rounds of 1 min. 45 sec. , In which the attacker must detonate a bomb at certain points , and protection appropriate to allow this to happen. One of the major advantages is the fact that CS: GO this type of game ( with minor changes ) placed in a separate section of the menu called ' competitive mode ' . Introduced a system of titles that helps you find a match according to your skill. In CS 1.6 and CS: Source competitive mode by default absent and was available only on certain servers , specially tuned for this type of game. The gameplay is not changed . Actually , nothing changed and is not required , a familiar mechanic works on hurray . Fixed characteristics of some weapons , something removed, something added to the overall picture it does not have nearly no effect. Shooting became more random, yes. But perhaps the most realistic FPS in the moment. If multiplayer shooter from you wait not fancy graphics and ballistics believable and interesting gameplay, then welcome to the CS: GO. Valve managed to make an almost perfect balance of gaming devices. With proper skill you can neutralize the enemy with a much more powerful weapon . Pistol rounds in CS: GO is not known to sink without a chance and an opportunity to take the round even with poor economies . But the most important advantage is the ratio of Valve to his fans . Almost every week there is a free upgrade , changing the gameplay for the better, in order to achieve a perfect balance . Approximately every six months out extensive additions cost 5-7 dollars with soccer fans cards that are available in the competitive mode. That's not counting skins for weapons that can get special opening drawers. In addition to all Valve maintains its competitive community , sponsoring tournaments large sums . And I am delighted that the number of people playing CS: GO, is increasing every day . But on the other hand it is the community CS was for me the only problem in this game. Because it often turns into a competitive mode into a farce and mutual humiliation. The only solution - only play with friends. Total we have a great continuation of one of the greatest franchises in history. To purchase required if gaming is important to you the gameplay itself . Best multiplayer shooter at this point, in my opinion. - beardATTACK @ fren

review: At first I was a little hesitant of Global Offensive after such a long time playing Source, which is a flawless game, although GO gives nostolgia. Do you miss when players talked over mics to give away postions and assistance? Do you miss competive action that CS had in the beginning? Do you want updated graphics and a new hitbox to learn? then come on what are you waiting for buy CSGO, and go Go GO!

review: When it comes down to it, CSGO may follow the same old formula of gameplay seen in previous versions of Counter-Strike, but it's still a well-rounded tactical shooter. It may not try anything drastically different or revolutionize the series by taking it in a new direction, but there's still enough there to appeal to newbies and hardcore fans alike.

review: In Counter-Strike:GO you play as Tom Clancy's younger brother; Al Clancy. Growing up Tom gave Al a hard time ruffling his hair and calling him names such as "weird Al" Barbara and John Clancy brought up these two whiper snappers in the state of ohio in the USA. They were a middle class family. When Al turned 7 his mum and dad bought him a pair of Night Vision goggles for Christmas. Tom being the the young nipper scallion he was decided it was a good idea to steal these as they were proper flipping oreyt. The sense of achievment Tom got when he stole these glasses was second to none, it didnt take long for tom to get addicted to ruining christmas. (fun fact, the grinch is loosely based on this story.) As they grew older it became clear that all tom and his football friends wanted to do was ruin christmas, They called themselves Christerrorists. This new movement led to the boys seeing a darker side of themselves, they began finding care packages santa had dropped for deprived children and strapping C4 on them. The ultimate way to ruin Christmas. Al was enraged when he became aware of this, he did the only thing a right wing father of 3 christmas loving American could do in this situation... Bought a metric sh**t tonne of guns and grenades. He began handing these out to friends and neighboors on his cul de sac. They soon became The Count Christerroists. The game is purely story mode. With this special addition you play as both Christerroists and Counter Christerrorists, in a sort of heads to head. (!!!!!!!!spoilers the story gets a little confusing as it is mainly about how many quick scopes you can do with the AWP and standing at Mid With bomb while your team clear a plant site and then losing the game) I dont want to give too much away so I will leave this review here, I hope you found it helpful. I would rate this game a 7/10 it could get a 9 but due to it being a christmas game I can only play around the festive time of year otherwise it seems a little silly. Like when you here Fairy Tale of new york by the pogues in august. It just doesnt feel right.

review: CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.

review: Counter-Strike is well-known to be the best competitive modern First Person Ego Shooter. Obviously 'competitive' is stressed. This means the game is very hard for the beginners, because of its depth. You simply cannot jump into that game without any knowledge or guide... you can do that on casual ones tough. And there are too many of these out there. E-Sports is also the priority of the game. It is also responsible for the extreme balance and balance fixes that Valve takes care off. This is a significant factor to keep the game enjoyable on the long term. Of course you can run and gun with a P90 or camp with the autosniper, which is easy, but good players can defend themselves well. Some have great crosshair placement to eliminate the threat with a simple click: - "Boom. Headshot." Not only crosshair placement, but also the recoil control, the positioning, the movement or let's just shorten it, the whole experience and skills can differenciate a CS veteran and a simple amateur. These skills and experince need to be trained otherwise you end up being punished. Badly. The main focus of the game is the competitive mode, where you play with four teammates against five enemies for up to an hour. Talking about teammates, playing with friends is the best thing you can do there. In most games the team isn't as important as in CS:GO. Everybody is important since it's 5vs5 and not more. YOU NEED TO COMMUNICATE. This is the actual key to victory aswell as having a glorious match! There are too many strangers who do destroy the game experience and like every competitive game, they can be toxic. After winning a while, you'll get a rank which allows you to play with people with the same skill set as you do. Well, most of the time; I'm talking about smurfers. Those aren't a long term problem tough - they'll get to a certain rank and then it's useless, but can be used for trolling... Luckily I haven't met many trolls. Back to the ranks: I have a certain statement about these. I wish they added team ranking aswell as solo rank just as they did in Dota 2. Oh, they should definitively add more clan functions like the other game I mentioned. Hacks are a minor problems there - Overwatch will take care of it, but someone has to suffer until the hacker gets banned... Many outsiders think that CS has bad graphics. I don't think so since CS:GO. They're decent and acceptable and every other thing makes this "problem" up. The source engine is not bugfree of course, but is has been proven to be relatively reliable. It should not be forgotten that CS can run on many hardware flawless. Skins and operations are not required to be paid - you'll get drops and if your friend has an operation, you still can play with him/her. Skins can be obtained by simply playing, betting through CSGOlounge, buying from the steam market, steam trading and by opening boxes. The boxes require keys, which cost 2 Euros each. You can get a really expensive skins, mediocre skins and skins that you wish you could undo it. Chances are that you end up at the third option and are trying to build a time machine. Operations are seasons passes with maps provided by the community. These only last for a while. I must say that is good idea that the community can earn money from valve by providing maps and skins... when it's successful enough. All in all CS:GO is a good buy if you're willing to spend enough time on it. It'll come to fruition and become a rewarding game. Some matches can ruin it tough. Valve proves again for being one of the greatest video game developer.

The community is large-I've yet to find a lobby that has less than 5 people in it. The game also runs on the Source engine, resulting in very attractive graphics that have a minimal impact on my GPU. Either way, I love this game and recommend it to anybody who is looking for a cheap, easy first person shooter.

review: Ready to play a REAL FPS? This isn't you run of the mill kiddie 360xXNoScopeXxQuickscope dropshot game, your skill doesn't depend on scopes or grips, heartbeat sensors or noob tubes, this game is all about gaining personal skill. Your improvement and developement as a player will depend on your willingness to learn and devote time to learning "strats" to improve your gameplay as a team, or as a solo player. You will practice smokes and flash grenade spots for hours to use in competitive matches, sit in aim maps and perfect your reactions and headshots. Just because someone happens to get a lucky headshot on you, or is steamrolling you in competitive doesn't make them a hacker, they are simply out-playing you, and you need to adapt to that. You will need to be able to read your enemies movements, placement, and gameplay to continue to dominate in competitive, and this all comes with practice and time playing. You're not going to jump into this game playing like a pro, you will start from the bottom just how everyone else has, and work your way up as you develop a better feel for the game as a whole. 10/10 r.i.p. social life

Whilst all this is happening you're getting yelled at by professional gamers who spent their last paycheck on an in-game knife and reading passive-aggressive statements directed at you by the opposing team.

review: Favorite current FPS but not all time. All of the game modes that the game offers are fun if you enjoy the game and often made updates to the game are satisfying (Operation packs). Aside from cheaters and griefers, who you'll come across surely, matchmaking is my favorite along side with Casual. Community servers offer a lot of fun maps and game modes as well such as: zombie; de_surf; de_rats; etc. The game offers a bonus mini-game which is called "Unboxing A Case". If you choose to play it you will often be left with disappointment and questions raised by your family such as "Where has all the money gone?". Some say the ecstasy you recieve from winning some of the rarest items in the game is worth the tears you cry after opening some of these cases. Legend says that by selling the most valuable item recieved from the "Unboxing A Case" game you'll have enough money to buy ever game on Steam. 10/10, would open more.

review: CG:GO is a blast to the past; a nod to the old-school days of the late 90's, and it's more than welcome in my gaming livery. Whilst I love COD and Titanfall, there's something uniquely compelling about starting up a match of CS:GO, with it's deliberate and stayed pacing, and it's risk vs reward gameplay mechanics, it's no wonder this game has taken off for the 3rd time in it's lifecycle. It's popular right now for a reason, and that reason is good. A must-buy.

review: Favorite current FPS but not all time. All of the game modes that the game offers are fun if you enjoy the game and often made updates to the game are satisfying (Operation packs). Aside from cheaters and griefers, who you'll come across surely, matchmaking is my favorite along side with Casual. Community servers offer a lot of fun maps and game modes as well such as: zombie; de_surf; de_rats; etc. The game offers a bonus mini-game which is called "Unboxing A Case". If you choose to play it you will often be left with disappointment and questions raised by your family such as "Where has all the money gone?". Some say the ecstasy you recieve from winning some of the rarest items in the game is worth the tears you cry after opening some of these cases. Legend says that by selling the most valuable item recieved from the "Unboxing A Case" game you'll have enough money to buy ever game on Steam. 10/10, would open more.

review: n sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didnt go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield. Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided its time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.

review: So there I was. Contemplating what to do next when BAM I'm dead. Now what to do? Watch other players. I was on the hunt. Trying to avenge myself. I find him, I start running towards him, guns blazing! BAM. Shot dead again, not by the man I was after, no someone else stole that glory from me, but by his friendlies! This games makes you feel emotions like never before. Primarily Anger, Disappointment, and Sadness. IT MAKES YOU FEEL THEM ALL AT ONCE! To make it worse, it makes you addicted to the little bit of Happiness you get when you do go. You crave it. You yurn for it. Then when you have it, its quickly taken away from you by AK-47 or an AWP. Try to find a game that does better.

review: An incredibly unique and relentlessly addicting multiplayer fps. I never played much Source or any other CS games, but this game is in my top 5 favorite multiplayer games of all time. CS:GO offers a much different experience than your average FPS for numerous reasons, making it a fresh experience every time you play. GO also offers tons of maps, Ranging from the cobblestone streets of Italy to the Moist ruins of Aztec. Gameplay is great, and the loadout system is unique and fun. Tons of weapons to choose from, and now, with the recent update, you can unlock unique skins for your weapons and unlock them from crates, similar to TF2 . Except for your occasional gamer  (And if youre quick on your feet, it wont be a problem), this is a great game. Whether its just playing casual and enjoying multiplayer gaming, or going pro and playing competitive, this great game. 9 .4/10

It is way to heavily reliant on teammates aswell as there are a lot of a abusers of the system, we like to call them "smurfs" Also hackers rule this game so there are alot of hackusations around but overall it can be very enjoyable. Good if you play with a good team of friends.

review: Basically its Counter-Strike. If you dont know what Counter-Strike is and know Battlefield you are safe but if you only know Call of Duty you are not safe. Ok lets get into my personal review about this game: Basically its still Counter-Strike with added features that makes the game more fun to play with. They added skins which you can make money off it or to show to your friends. The one thing I like about CS:GO is their matchmaking system.It groups you into your respective skill group to play against the same ranked people you are in. Beware of Smurfers tho there are alot lately but I find it fun battling smurfers since I can have a little view or insight about how high rankers play. OK about the skins, its not call of duty but its optional. But hey you can make money off it since you can get case drops, skin drops, etc. For the game itself, its still counter-strike. Thats all I can say basically, its still CS with added features and such to make the game more enjoyable than the previous ones. If you get hooked up with the skins you will last a few hundreds of hours, yes, hundreds of hours since I already done this on my first account and I really enjoy doing what I like to do with skins. There may be hackers and such in matchmaking or any other gamemode but all I do is just basically report them and just ignore them throughout the match even if its 100% lose for us. Anyways for me this is the best version of Counter-Strike I ever played since 1.6 which is I played it on another computer :p. Pick this up for 15 bucks or 419 Philippine pesos or whatever price your currency puts it to since its an awesome, enjoyable competitive game and it lasts AGES. Heck 1.6 even has a few hundreds - thousands of players playing it and about this around more than that. Pick it up its a nice First Person Shooter and I will recommend this to ANY kind of person, either casual players or competitive players. I would rate it around 9 - 9.5/10

review: This is a super awesome and fun game that reminds me of CoD: Modern Warfare(better known as Cod4). Anyone who has been playing FPSs for years will understand what I am saying, and generally everyone agrees that CoD4 was one of the best franchise FPS games ever developed. While I don't think CS:GO is on the CoD4 level, it certainly does have that feel to it, and that's what draws me towards this game. The feeling I get from this game is one of simplicity and functionality; something too many game corporations out there continue to skip right past. All they want to do is make these crazy FPS games with all these unnecessary gadgets and "killstreaks" and tons of other crap, when in reality, all the game community wants is a simple, stable, fun, and hardcore matchmaking powerhouse. For me, CS:GO hits all of the high points, while only hitting maybe one or two of the low points. Get this game.

review: My teeth were clenched, like how my fingers were clenched on the handle and forestock of my AWP that I had scavenged. Earlier, I had paused to admire the blue-ish purple honeycombs on the sniper rifle. Now, I no longer cared about how my weapon looked like. As long as it could fire a projectile fast enough to end the life of my target, I was satisfied. The fiend was still shooting. His battle cry was fresh in my ears. As was the sound of the bomb, the timer ticking away. His IMI Negev pelted the gap in the wall with dozens of bullets, each one threatening to take my head off. That sorry fate had happened to my comrades, who laid dead on the ground with 5.56x45mm bullets in their still corpses. I was the last one. I could avenge my comrades, defuse the bomb, and emerge a hero... Or I could die. I looked for other options. Leaving the bomb was not an option. Going through the double doors would only sign my death certificate, as my late-teammates proved. I had to do it. The Terrorist's gun had a high rate of fire, but it was inaccurate at such a range. It was the only gamble that I could take. A mental clock timed down in my head. Three...two...ONE. I bolted through the gap, but not all the way. I brought up my rifle, staring through the scope at the madman who continued to shoot haphazardly. His bullets were flying around. I felt a searing gash of heat on my thigh, and knew I was hit once. But it would not save the murderer. My crosshairs now laid upon his chest, which was drenched with sweat and stained with the blood of men. My finger, already closed around the trigger, squeezed it. The shot rang out, and the .338 Lapua Magnum round tore through the air and into the Terrorist's chest, ending his life instantly. I lowered my rifle, panting heavily. I had no time to celebrate. I looked down at the planted bomb, less than 10 seconds away from igniting. I leapt down from the boxes, landing squarely on my feet. I had cast away the AWP, pulling out my Defusal Kit instead. I gripped the pliers, and squatted down. My fingers reached for the bomb, closing around it. I eased the pliers between the wire, hearing the beeping get faster and faster. I squeezed my right hand tight, and the beeping stopped. I fell back on my backside, dropping the pliers as I took massive gulps of air. This was the ninth operation I took part in. And the ninth one that I emerged alive. That was my story, depicting my recent Competitive game on Dust 2. Yes, the AWP was the Electric Hive skin. Yes, it was at B. If you want a summary of a good round of CSGO, there it is. If you want my rating of the game, here it is. 10/10, would play again for every day for the next 3 years (Get what I am implying, Valve? Where is my HL3? xD). EPILOGUE =D Alarms blared in the dormitory. I quickly did up my uniform, lacing up my boots and reaching for my Heckler and Koch P2000 and my Knife. As I slid them into the holster and the sheath, I could feel the adrenaline rushing in. My tenth operation. I pulled my balaclava on, followed by my helmet. My mind began racing, thinking about what would happen, should I be able to return from this. I would be assessed by the Board and designated to a squad. I had spent many nights, dreaming about the moment. Of course, to reach that moment, I would have to come out of this operation alive. And I was going to come out of it alive. I will survive. Not just survive. I will win.

review: I used to like this game. It's funny because I'd rather Team Fortress 2 over this now. Ever since late 2014-Now , Cs:GO is full of toddlers , teens saying how they're better than you and you are  , people unboxing on youtube screaming "GABEN,GABEN Oh Please GABEN!" To the point where it's not even funny and cringe-worthy. And not to mention a handful of 'gamer girls' on Twitch unboxing and playing the game just for money. Nowadays you probably can't get put into a game without some kid with a Five Nights At Freddys picture , some kid screaming "Praise Gaben" into the mic and people with a $1,000 Inventory and they're not even good at the game. Even when you go competitive and you are going to get harassed by the other team and called a hacker when you get good shots or are better than them. Before people actually complimented them getting a nice kill or an ace , now it's just "HACKER , LOL ENJOY THE VAC BRO LOLOL". And if the other team end up getting a nice kill on you it's just " LOLOLO GET REMT , REKT U  !! GET GOOD AT THE GAME REMT REMT REMT REMT!!". But the game itself is actually really good and has nice guns,map designs and mechanics. But the community itself is slowly turning into a cross of Call Of Duty and Team Fortress 2. TL;DR : Cs:GO community is , but game is good.

I played it every night with my friends, trying to rank up in competetive or just having some fun conversations and troll around in casual. The only thing they should change is the price for the keys.... It started with 1,79  and after months the price slowly raised to 1,99 . All I can say is that CS:GO is definitely worth it's money.

review: Countless allnighters come to my mind when I hear the name "Counter-Strike" That game is something I'll remember discovering during my middleschool years. It to me, and i'm sure others, was a great way to escape and unwind after a long day. I don't see it slowing down in that department with Global Offensive. It combines the old with the new and I will admit that there is indeed a learning curve when it comes to aiming with those weapons but all it took was a few rounds of deathmatch and then I could effecetivly kill without being the "bambie" so to speak. Don't think this game is all gold and now scuffs. This game sure does have its short comings but that goes with any top notch game. Unless you're standing still and throwing grenades, you should compensate for the movemnet of the nade. I understand that this use to be something in Cs.s and other titles but I feel it's more apparent in Global. The balistics are far better than previous Counter-Strike games IMO,and it's interesting to see how the different guns have different spread and penetration, etc. This game is fantastic to play with friends, or if you're looking to make friends this game is still fun to play. Don't forget to practice if you're having a hard time with aiming, or understanding the map.

You plant the c4 and defend it from the counter terrorist team, or if you play as ct, you have to defend your bombsites (A and B) from the terrorists. In certain maps, you can rescue hostages, too. This game has also many mods. Casual, competitive (classic ESL game in cs 1.6, but with cs go ranks) If you want to have fun, this game can also offer it, with the other mods, surf, deathrun etc.

review: Currently one of the best and only real competitive fps out there. A great variety of weaponry and maps. The game also gets constant updates from community feedback. However it has a vey big learning curve. For the first 50 hours or so you won't be very good at the game. As long as you get decent skill after that, you will have alot more fun.

review: This is an excellent first person shooter that takes time to get used to, it's not your average Call of Duty or Battlefield. You don't frag people for some random scope for your rifle or a suppressor, instead you are trying to master out the legendary weapons that have been in all CS titles. The AK-47, the M4 and the AWP. These are the quite important ones, and the way to go.

review: I've played this game for close to 800 hours over the past year or so... and I have nothing better to do, so here's a really long in-depth review of ''Counter-Strike: Global Offensive''! To start I'd like to point out that this game has a huge skill gap, meaning someone who's been playing for a year will be exponentially better than someone who's just starting. (Which is common with most games, but this game needs to have a lot of time put into it in general to be semi decent..) Learning spray patterns and maps can be time consuming, but in the long run will pay off hugly. CS doesn't always have the best community to help you out though, this can be a major turn off in this regard. Sure there are videos to look up and guides on the steam hub, but if you lack knowledge of something in-game you can assume you'll get flooded with insults and negativity. Not all people are like this, but from spending lots of time in ''Silver'' ranking, I have noticed lacking some information is just asking for trouble with some players. (Silver is the lowest of the MM ranks, meaning the newer or lower skill level players. The reason I bring this up is that most people will be placed in silver, meaning that they will have to go through huge amounts of negativity before being able to improve.) And ofcourse there is always the option of reporting people for being ''offensive'' or not being a good teammate, but as in other games this is nearly never enforced. This isn't always an issue in the higher ranks though, some people can be supporting and helpful in their pursuit to get better! So if you're new to gaming you may not really understand the importance of having a group of people to play with, do you? This is one of the things I can't stress enough to people who wish to play this game or who are having troubles with it. Never. Play. Alone. Plant those words into your head, never forget them. Now I don't want this to seem like some guide to get better, but all I want to bring to attention is that this is a ''Team Based Shooter''. With that being said, it's a lot better to have a nice group of people to play with, so keep that in-mind if you decide to buy this title. (As I said in the first part of this review, the random people you meet in-game aren't always the nicest...) Now that, that is over let's get into a more fun yet controversial topic... skins and in-game transactions! The only reason I'm adding a small section for this is due to the fact this can push people away from games in the fear of them being ''Pay2Play''. And I won't lie when I say Valve does it right with CS;GO, they made it a truley fair platform which seems to be hard for most devs to do now a days. There are 3 mains things you can spend your money on in CS;GO, one of those being skins/stickers. Skins and Stickers are mainly added to make your weapons look nicer than their default variation, this ofcourse being 100% optional. (No skins or stickers raise stat's of guns, they're just re-skinned weapons.) The nxt way you can spend money in-game is with Valve's famous in-game gambling... I mean weapons crates and keys! A case and key are basically items in-game that can be used together to craft or ''open'' another item, usually being a re-skinned weapon. Crates can be bought from the market for their on-going price which goes up and down depending on the situation of the economy. (They can also be gotten from in-game drops, which are basically random items you can get from playing games of CS;GO. While I'm on the topic of drops, you can get re-skins from drops too, but these are the ''worst of the worst'' skins in most people's eyes.) And then all you need from here is a key, which you can happily buy from the CSGO shop for $2.5 or your national equivalent. Before I move on to the third and last set of things to be bought, I'd like to say that opening cases is never worth it! I'm not trying to be a buzz kill in any way, I just want to bring it to people's attention that wasting $100's isn't always going to guarantee you a nice shiny skin or your money back. And now for the last but not least... Operations! Operations are like DLC in the sense of it adds 5 new maps to the game, but only for the limited time (Usually 3-4 months). The Operations have differing prices, when it first comes out it will cost around $7, then go down to $4, then to $1. Operations also give you nice rewards like case drops that only ''Operation Owners'' will get, these are nice in the sense of they sell for lots of money on the market, and can easily make your money back from what you spent on the pass. Now that's all I want to say about this subject, but again I just wanted to make it clear that this game is NOT ''Pay2Play'' at all. Does this game have a dedicated dev team to fix problems and update the game? This question is something you always want to ask when buying a game like this, since in the end it's all multiplayer and can get old over time. Well I'll be honest when I say yes and no. The dev team is really good about coming out with updates every week or two, may they be bug fixes or full blown out updates. (New maps, weapons, etc.) There's always the issue of missing things or adding ''useless'' things into the game, but that doesn't seem to happen too often. Does CS;GO get old? Meh, that isn't for me to say, it did for me but that can change from person to person. They try to add and remove enough every so often so it doesn't, but there's always the fact of a game being played to the point where it just isn't fin anymore, nothing can stop that. And while we're on this topic I'd also like to bring up that Valve has added an amazing workshop feature to this game. It really gives people the power to add to the game and makes it fun to see how creative some of the players really are! I'd like to end this by saying that CSGO is a good game full of amazingcommunity servers, competitive gamemodes and just lots of fun to be had with friends. For this price, I'd reccomend this to anyone who enjoys FPS and skill based games. Thanks for reading and have fun if you do end up buying the game! :D

Global Offensive's match making tools make the interface user-friendly and the gun collection is a great feature, especially the eye candy that can be viewed amongst the community. The mechanics of the game perform outstandingly, and the feel to the game is irreplaceable. Over all this is an amazing version of the game, and for 15$ it is unbeatable in the FPS GENRE!

review: Valve's Gold Mine. This is the greatest game series history has seen- Counterstrike is the best FPS (not milsim) game series out there. Counterstrike: Global Offensive surpasses its predecessors in excellence- it is Valve's piece of art. It will never get boring. At first I played a bit then got bored, then I started playing Competitive and CS:GO managed to shine its light. This has everything a gamer wants: Strategy Skill Tactics Communication Teamwork Scaling the wall from casual to competitive is difficult, but every second of hard work is worth it. One must learn from his/her defeats and strive to get better. We are a community here to foster the growth of game that is meant to unite the vying factions of 1.6 and source. For some great youtube videos and tutorials, check out WarOwl on youtube. CS:GO is the FPS bomb! Get in and GeT_RIGhT.

review: CS:GO is still very much a Counter-Strike game, for better or worse. There's little new here gameplay-wise. The game introduces some new modes and improved maps and graphics. The most innovative aspect is probably the new item drop system, well-known from Valve's other games, which is a game changer in my opinion. Playing the game actually pays off. There's also Workshop support, but finding servers that has those maps is near impossible. However, some of the best maps are hosted officially during operation events, requiring that you purchase a ticket. Workshop weapon skins are also added to the game now and then. In today's market this game is a bit thin, but they do have a competitive fanbase they have to cater to. It's entertaining to a certain degree, but in my opinion it's not a great game. The gameplay is dated. Improving stats, playing competitively and obtaining items may drive you for a while, but the experience isn't all that great. But, sometimes simple is good. It comes down to if you like Counter-Strike or not. If you do, you might like how they've freshened it up. Hardcore Counter-Strike fans, however, might prefer the old games. The good thing is that this game is cheap and often on sale. Why don't you give it a GO?

review: The Counter Strike franchise was introduced to me by CS:GO. Several friends of mine were constantly playing so I decided to buy this game. One of the best decisions I've made! This game is the best competitive fps out there and one of the best fps games. It's not a game where you play to unlock guns, attachments, scopes etc. The only thing to work foward to is getting better. This game has a pretty big emphasis on death because the fact you live once per round and you must buy guns at the start of a round, you do not spawn with them. This game also has a huge emphasis on strategy. There is strategy everywhere from how to defend bomb sites to where you plant the bomb on the bomb site. There are two competitve gamemodes: A bomb scenerio and a hostage scenerio. In bomb scenerio the terrorist are trying to plant the bomb on site A or site B and the counter terrorist are trying to stop them. In hostage the counter terrorist are trying rescue the hostages while the terrorist are trying to stop the counter terriost. Both gamemodes are fun and require strategy and map awarness. The competitive match making system makes it easy to hop in with friends or your clan and find a match fast with eneimies around your skill level. The gameplay is very smooth. The shooting mechanics are one my favorites parts on this game with a pretty big emphasis on recoil and headshots compared to other fps games. A downside to this game is the visual element. It's not bad it is playable just not the best the game could look seeing how it was released in 2012. Counter Strike has a decent community most people are open to new players and will give them tips to help them out. I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy competitive fps games. If you enjoy this game you will most likely find yourself pouring countless hours into this game to improve your skill. I rate this game a 9.8/10

You can make competitions, can be played on normal and abnormal funny servers You get temporarily weapons or boxes that you can use in the game Disadvantages: Disadvantages include the Steam or Valve occasionally have problems with the servers ..... It has also cheaters who get nothing in life to the series and want to achieve something in the game Although it has more pros and cons but I think that's enough I recommend it to anyone but do not become addicted;) So have fun with it

review: A very addictive first-person shooter game with a large community. Since the developers updates the game regularly with missions and maps, it never gets old. The game offers a good matchmaking system which creates a competitive match between players with equal skills. Only drawback is that the anti-cheat is not so good at detecting cheating software, so one will from time to time encounter a cheater. Despite this drawback, the game is excellent. I would recommend Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to thoose that enjoy a good online shooter.

review: I've been playing CS 1.6 since after its' release, hell i've been playing CS since the release of 1.5 even(Mainly on non-steam LAN tho, i must confess) and thus far this is probably the best. it has the smooth and proper aim of 1.5 for most part when it counts, the accuracy of pistols are absolutely nostalgic in it and all pistols are actually worth playing with now with the change in damages. when it comes to SMGs and Rifles it's much more similar to 1.6 in early days except for AK47, GOD knows how i missed the super-accurate AK47 from 1.6. It also makes more sense to play with Galil and Famas now. About the sniper, well...i've never used sniper when it was serious but an amazing sniper i knew got interested in this game after playing around with AWP and SSG for around 10minutes. Almost forgot about the Heavy group of loadout being muuuuch more fun to play now and how the shotguns aren't useless from more than 10meters away. The only thing which was abit harder to enjoy on this release was jumping. Harder than 1.6 but with much more of a...kinda...air-control, guess i should say. Might be annoying at first, but you'll surely enjoy it after getting used to it. On top of all those improvements, there are weapon skins now making it more fun for the casual players. Another thing worthy of mentioning would be netcode improvements. Since i've always played videogames with higher amounts of pingtime i've been more careful about that part. in CS:GO you get to search for servers with pings as high as 350ms! Now...it doesn't really sound good when said alone, but the netcode is done well enough to make sure it's still playable with such high latency(However you have to cover the high ping time with better and faster reflexes at the end again). On a last note, i really hope valve improves the source engine. A little bit prettier envirounment and characters while saving the simple-looking options wouldn't hurt.

review: Like the previous games in the series, Global Offensive is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter. Each player joins either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist team and attempts to complete objectives or eliminate the enemy team. The game operates in short rounds that end when all players on one side are dead or a team's objective is completed. For most game modes, once a player dies, they must wait until the round ends to respawn. Players purchase weapons and equipment at the beginning of every round with money awarded based on their performance. Completing objectives or killing enemies earns the player money while negative actions, like killing a teammate or hostage, takes money away from the player. In addition, when a round ends all players receive some amount of money, with players on the winning team receiving substantially more. Counter Strike Global Offensive adds new weapons and equipment not seen in previous installments, most notably the firebomb for each side (Molotovs for Terrorists and incendiary grenades for Counter-Terrorists). These temporarily cover a small area in fire, dealing damage to anyone passing through.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first person shooter game that takes immense skill, which I do not have. However even if you are a terrible player, CS: GO allows you to still call other players "noob" or "pleb". This is what makes CS: GO a magnificent work of art. However, you cannot slay donkeys with swords (though you can slay chickens with knives).

review: I stand there surveying the battlefield, full of my deceased comrades. During that time i had two things on my mind, one being that my fate determines on this moment, and that my AWP Redline looks intimidating with my newly added "Welcome to the Clutch" sticker. With that boost of confidence I ready myself for whatever comes next. I then instinctivly tap 'tab' to see what im going up against, and mutter under my breath, "Pshhh 1v3.... eZ." I then approach the bombsite where i come in sight of my prey. I stare the target down like a fat boy eyeing a stick of butter. Deciding to make my move I lick my finger, gathering as much saliva as possible, and cram it down the subjects ear. He screams in agonizing pain, and torture. I know I must finish him, so I grasp for his bloomers, and pull. Thus summoning an atomic wedgie which instantly incapacitates the man. Knowing what I have done I cannot help but tea bag the corspe a few times. Meanwhile I recieve a message stating that the bomb was planted. I suddenly stop the nonsense and move on to my next set of victims. Which were going to be tougher to crack than the first. I think of what I am going to do next, knowing I do not have much time, so I do what is best. I conjure my inner animal. Resulting to me being restrained to using the Deagle in a showy manner. I then come into sight of the bombsite, to abruptly run into my pursuers. My inner animal guides me toward my desiard location, and fires resulting in a collateral killing them both. In shock, I swiftly head towards the bomb knowing it will go off at any moment. But all worries fade when I am quickly informed by a gentleman on the opposing team, that F10 is a shortcut for instant defuse. Before executing the task, I mutter,"idiot." And spam the F10 key as fast as I can with my right index finger, overcome with joy I begin my victory chant to celebrate our win. But when I look back at my screen it reveals an EXACT copy of my desktop, that is INTERACTABLE. Holy cannoli, Valve you really did over due your self on this extrodinary easter egg. I really anticipate you guys adding more stuff like this easter egg in the future, never in my life have i seen so much detail be put into something so little.

review: What can I say, this game is made by Valve, therefore I am obligated to love it. In all honesty, this game is in some cases harder than other FPS's I've played, and in other cases easier. The community is large-I've yet to find a lobby that has less than 5 people in it. The game also runs on the Source engine, resulting in very attractive graphics that have a minimal impact on my GPU. Either way, I love this game and recommend it to anybody who is looking for a cheap, easy first person shooter.

review: ---------Sadly i have to edit my review-------------- Im playing this game now for just too long to understand the core thinking of the makers of the game. Sadly i have to give the game a thumbs up anyway because the thumbs up are maybe for the best 1st person shooting game of all time... i played them all fromcs begginings till now even COD, BF probably all versions till now. But i have to admitt all this games cannot top CS:GO. Cs is just a very fast, team oriented 1st person shooter that will pull you in and never let go... Atleast what i thought so till now... Now i have to come to the problem... and the problem is: --------------------------------------------------CHEATING--------------------------------------------------------------------- Since the game came out i knew there would be cheaters... It sadly now belongs to almost every online game there is... But this became different... Allredy at the beggining i was wondering about the price of the game ... found it kinda cheap for such a good game only 14 Euro or something... At that point i allready thougt that its kinda easy for cheaters to rebuy a new account even if they should get banned... But i could never ever even imagine that it gets even better untill i realized that its beeing sold atleast once a month for ca 3 Euro... I dont know if this is aa dream or a insult to all the players who want to play a clean game... i dont think i have to explain what consequences this had on cheating.... So because of that the complainments and reports pilled up and valve was searching for a solution that doesnt cost them a thing and they get the cheaters atleast a lil bit under controll... so they made OVERWATCH... now they dont have to pull a finger and they work is beeing done by slaves (Players) who are hoping on a cleaner game one day... Nice story but whats this the game costs 3 Euro again so this guy (Cheater) buys this time 6 accounts so he has resources now for atleast 4 months to play and cheat... This is getting out of control VALVE you are making allready big money with this Skins and Market stuff why in Gods name cant you spent some of the money for making the game more enjoyable where you bann those cheaters and get us ----------------128-tick------------ SERVERS----------!!!!!! If these arogant stance of yours wont change you will loose probably a lot of players... I am a very active player but i quited the game for almost 2 moths last year because of that...

review: As someone who has played years of the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises, I've really grown to like this game. It has the usual FPS feel, but of course the physics take some time to get used to when switching from other similar games. There is a lot more team work required, especially when playing competative, a game format which becomes addictive. Everyone is going to like different games for different reasons, but for a game that is a quarter of the price of mainstream commercial products, this is where I've been spending my time.

review: My full review will be mentioned now: Counter Strike Global Offensive is a tactical multiplayer focused fps. You cannot aim just like any other CS game. Accuracy is key when trying to get those mlg headshots. One shot to the head can end it for you with most guns, so staying in a group is advised. So if you like team based shooters, which require a steep learing curving. Definitly pick this game up now and enjoy for many hours to be lost!
game-hours: 924.5
review: When it comes down to it, CSGO may follow the same old formula of gameplay seen in previous versions of Counter-Strike, but it's still a well-rounded tactical shooter. It may not try anything drastically different or revolutionize the series by taking it in a new direction, but there's still enough there to appeal to newbies and hardcore fans alike.

review: First of all, note that graphon really managed. And not even in terms of the "cruisey" hi-endnote graphics, but in terms of quality of work of designers, mappers, modelers, and others. Because the maps look really good, modelki weapons and players are also good (that is, in fact, they just made qualitatively and of themselves are good, but look if they do well in this game is another question) - in short, graton I liked, despite the fact that generally Counter Strike is not a game where important grafon. At least, there is no such flatulence, excessive brightness, as in Source - graphon GO just a nice, where you have the gloomy, where it is bright. In General, good graton, normal, pleases the eye and the stars from the sky is not enough. And the map is very good. That is, as. Most of the maps in GO are copies of classic maps from 1.6. However, in contrast to the same Source environment and the design altered almost completely - if the Source just got my texture, added normal Sormovsky features like lying all over the map garbage, there is virtually completely redesigned the concept and idea cards, leaving almost intact the original structure of the map. For example, de_dust2. In 1.6 and Source is a common Eastern city with pointed domes and intricate paintings a La cartoons about Aladdin. In GO, this map looks like a very levels of some CoD 4, because now this is not the tale of Aladdin, but rather dilapidated streets of, say, Syria. In this respect GO a head taller than their predecessors, meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression.

In this respect GO a head taller than their predecessors, meaning you have a lot of attention in the cards given to the parts that compose positive impression. All salt that GO missing... Like to call it, nanowaste. 1.6 was very simple, very cozy, home to some; Source immediately I did not like - but even he was closer to 1.6. GO looks more like a reincarnation of some Kalouti in the setting of Counter Strike, but not the reincarnation of 1.6, which oldpage will cry tears of joy and childishly happy face to fill the REP, laying bombs. It rather smacks of a banal desire to cut money for the same game for the third time, as would be sad as that sounds Another thing I want to say - GO is very ambiguous in terms of its scall. I.e. developers, for example, wanted to add in a new game mods from the old games that were very popular. This well. But they added for some reason only the GunGame mode - it is here we must pay tribute, implemented well and about no less popular ZombieMod, DeathRun, JailBreak somehow forgot. It seems that the developers do not know how to make the game was close in spirit to the original, but it has pleased the fans of modern soulless postrelushka and add a little bit of everything in the blind hope that this trick will work. Now added, for example, GunGame. Here graton pulled. Well. The REP and iCloud too. But what pushed statistics and ranks these ing. Added new weapon. Why dog on earth, added, everything seems so normal it was. But no - added some idiotic tactical grenades-blende, some Molotov cocktails, which, BL**u, I've never let nobody uses zapili some popsource trailers on YouTube that all so spot on and crap - Oh, what a new counter-Strick soap-cool, go-ka przekazu and get the cannon in TF2. But the whole point of the game is that not myltse, and not even in puschka! Here such pies. Well, something like that. I think of my words and colour illustrations can in principle be what is no idea of Global Offensive. Actually, to make it even with the beta, then I even review I wanted to write, but somehow it never happened. In General, after the beta, not much has changed. Popisil nasty bugs, added new pictures to the main menu (Oh yeah), all other nonsense - but the game itself remains the same. And even then, at the stage of beta, you can understand what is still feil. Because Valve have tried to keep up with two rabbits and make a game that would love and ardent fans of the series, and fans of the new-fangled postrelushka. And chip, fellas, that, for example, those lovers of the postrelushka will not find in the "new" game is none favorite Blokov or hurricane some gameplay or killstreaks, equipment, single campaign in General, starburst solid, and only. And the old farts in the new game will not find the spirit of the old school, old models of weapons, any hints, rasprygat and other joys of life. And it is not clear to me, boys, for whom this game is made. And no, I'm not saying this game is bad, not at all, it is able to inspire, and not even for one night, and maybe even someone to buy the box with the game, which will be even smell good - but from the Studio named Valve everybody has come to expect more. Summing up short, so to say, the verdict, CS:GO is a game for a generation who does not know what B-5-1 and dablack. The only question is, lol, do I need itself GO to this generation.

review: For someone who played Counter-Strike for years, Counter-Strike Global Offensive is the succesion of that legendary game. VALVe perfectly knew that people wanted the real gameplay of Counter-Strike, and they did it good in CS:GO. The gamemodes are awesome, especially the matchmaking. Overwatch is something revolutionary to avoid cheaters, but there are still some that are not respecting fair-play. I recommend CS:GO to every people who want to see what a real FPS is.

review: I just noticed that I haven't recommended this yet. Well, not much to say eitherways. It's not like it's my favourite online FPS of all time or anything! I never played much of the previous games of the franchise but I think I can safely say that CS: GO is a huge improvement in comparison to the previous games, not only in terms of graphical fidelity but also in terms of gameplay, map design, weapon design and overall everything. You know how Valve is eitherways, even though it was Hidden Path Entertainment who developed CS: GO I believe Valve still has some saying on how they did it and how they keep on improving it. The game still is regularly updated, mostly due to community feedback and competetive gamers and profissional players feedback and suggestions. They not only keep optimizing the maps but also they keep tweaking each weapon which is both good and bad, it's mainly bad because it will take some time to get used to how the gun works post patch. I only have some small complaints about the game, the matchmaking system and the hit registration on servers seems to be pretty bad, I've heard from other people that in LAN games CS: GO hit registrations are perfect, one of the best, if not the best out there. Other than that I'm hyped to see how the game will progress and how the hardcore community will react to future updates. Counter Strike: Global Offensive is obviously not a game for everyone, if you're looking for a casual experience you're better off playing Call of Duty or Battlefield, CS: GO requires time, practice and skill. That said, I cannot recommend this game enough, I simply love it.

Counter Terrorists will have the objective to Defuse a Bomb when it gets planted or rescue the Hostages to a safe zone. Customized Weapons are also a good feature. 10/10 I find this as good as TF2

review: This version is a shame to the Counter Strike franchise, terrible map design where all ways to the bombsites are extremely claustrophobic and makes the game extremely CT sided together with powerfull smokes and fire grenades, not to mention useless flashbangs dont help the T side at all, bullet spread is completely wrong and overdone, you can spray 30 bullets into an opponent and only hit 1 or 2 bullets and skilled players are no longer able to clutch 1 vs X situations compared to CS 1.6, unbalanced weapons like MAG7 and P90, wallbanging was for the most part "removed", and sound positioning is terrible too. There are just too many wrong things with this game, if it wasnt for the skins and market system and valve spending money on tournaments this game would have never become popular. Hope this game stops being supported and valve releases a new proper version with help of the competitive community.

If you want to run and gun like a maniac, you will not have a good time, but that's why I like this game.

review: One of the, possibly THE best first person shooter out there. It's not full of un-neccessary animations that you'll find in other titles. The professional scene is outstanding, not as big as other titles like Call of Duty, which alledgedly has pro players, also known as a bunch of teens who trash talk in a game filled with aim assist. Valve never dissapoints, even with some nooks that need improvement, such as the tick rate, it is a title that delivers. The graphics are good. It is one of the most skill based games, and do not try to get good at this game by donating to get some powerful characters. Gunfights, action, tactics, strategy, anything that you would see in a war, this game delivers. I would give this a good rating, as the developers still have to do some work to satisfy some. There is a bit of work needed to perfect this game, and that bit is a point that I will be taking off of my rating. 9/10, would recommend, go out and get it now, if you do not like it, than you do not have the brain for a skill-demanding game. Unlike other developers that have their games die out in a few months, some, even weeks, the community for Counter Strike: Global Offensive keeps rising. Valve do not need to release a stupid sequel like some other publishers and developers do, they know how to satisfy the player, and they do not need so many DLC's that cost as much as the game. I have gone past my point, I think you can tell I am in love with it, I'd like to thank my brother for making me switch to this from the scum that is Call Of Duty.

review: Now that Militia and Assault have returned, I'm feeling much happier about this title. The developers continue to give love to this 2012 update to the old classic, walking the line between introducing new features and maintaining what the professional scene loves about Counter-strike. In my eyes, dump your old CS... this is where it's at. Molotov!

review: I love this game so much. Unlike many other games, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has realistic gun fireing, movement, physics, and many other realistic factors that you can not find in most first person shooters. Aside from the realism, my favorite part of the game is the strategy. This is a team strategy game with two different sides. I like to develop strategies that I can test in the famous Competative Match Making. The Competative MM uses ranks that you develop over time to put you in games with players at your level. Once you join a Competative MM match, you can not leave without a penulty, so you have to be carefull of your time. If you don't have time for a match and you want to play, just join a casual server. The casual servers don't hold you back and have no penulties or anything for losing or leaving. When you first get the game it will be incredibly hard, but if you practice you can get much better. This is one of my favorite games I have! -Cj

review: I tried going competitive and like really focus on improving, didn't actually go so well for me but great game though. My friends are crazy over this and it is really fun to watch. FPS taken to a whole new level, realistic and requires real skill. You say you've played "insert fps game here" and say you are good, really good? Well don't get your hopes up because you suck here! Mechanics are good, game play is good, learning curve is not that complicated, you just need a lot of practice. Like a lot. P.S. Always carry a defusal kit.. or take from a dead teammate.

review: I've created a strong love for this game, there is something about it to where it doesn't get boring because there's always a great feeling making big plays and being in a 1v3, having your heart racing and being extremely excited you just want more. Im here to say this game is not for everyone but if you want to get into it this is the time. There's always plenty of new players flowing in and learning the game. There are some things that really will ruin your experience and that would be cheaters. Don't be a cheater its good to know the game and gain the skill insteasd of using hacks to improve gameplay. But when you get a truly good match its 15-15 you know you want to win and its super tense thats when you get a love for the game. But if i were you i would truly try to stay away from matchmaking once your past eagle simply because there's to many cheaters and its gotten worse of the years. so i highly recommend deathmatching alot play matchmaking while your unranked or a silver for practice. learn angles, spray control, nade flash spots, team flashing tends to happen alot make sure you avoid that was much as possble. But i highly recommend this game its countless hours of fun expecially with your friends. But the number one rule is never give up your going to die alot there's always going to be better players then you thats why you indure your lack of skill and set a goal to be better then those other players. Also always be positive while doing a competitive matchmake never say good game (gg) just because you lost 3 rounds in a row that kills your attitude and your teams! Which will only guarentee a loss. Also have good sportsmanship like, nice shot (ns), good luck have fun (glhf), good half (gh). And remember this games a learning curve so never give up! because you will excel at the game at some point. So just jeep deathmatching learning map calls gaining game sense and learning angles and NEVER let someone bring you down ignore people who trash talk and make you feel like . always stay positive because you will be big someday... you've just got to own it.

review: Still, one of the finest FPS PC games out there. This newest edition builds on the legacy of what is CS and includes a whole lot more. You can still play the usual competitive games but it can organise these for you instead of searching #IRC for days or trying to plan a match via a game league. It also has some fun game types such as deathmatch, demolition and much more. With the option to purchase 'Operation Bravo' to play a few more maps and those that are still in beta testing it's simply superb. Valve also kindly provide some little holiday add ons to remind you what time of year it is when playing the game! Of course it does not come without it's draw backs. Bullet reg isn't the best, there are still quite a few cheaters in game and you get the usual 'kiddie' CS player who wants to whinge all game and grief but with a decent rest of the team these can simply be voted out. Going for 2.99 in the 2013 Holiday sale you would be an absolute fool not to buy it!

review: Despite the months of Beta Testing beforehand, my experience in the first month after launch has been ridden with annoying bugs and CTDs. The gameplay is pretty smooth, the weapons feel solid, and the flow feels more realistic. There are still many elements that make this game cheesy as ever (just float up a ladder), but for 15 bucks you will still get some very fun gameplay (Demolition is well balanced and enjoyable) and decent replay value as Valve adds more maps and content. If I had paid 50 bucks for this I would be pretty upset, but for its cheap price tag I can live with the bugs and slow updates. Recommended.

Demolition: small maps and quick games couldt be excetuted better. competetive: filled with idiots downing your rank quickly , the only way to get a better rank is to play with atleast 4 friends and try to take care of the one tard that doesnt lissen or speak. casual: good ol' cs 1.6 in a new body deathmatch: long rounds with respawn on the normal maps. you get to buy your own kit and try out or play with different tactics all and all its an awsome game 100% woth the money! 9.5/10 - a new must have on steam

review: If you'd compare this game with almost any other FPS you'd see that teamwork is really important in this game. Competitive play they added in CS:GO is great, it allows you to increase your rank level (or lose it). The best thing in CS:GO are the drops. Skins for weapons are really awesome, some of them at least. And then there is Operation Payback, it allows you to play Casual on Custom maps and increase your Payback coin level (Bronze, Silver, Gold). Then there is another good mod, Arms race. In this mod you have to kill 26 players, all with different weapons, and last the first one to get the kill with knife wins the round.

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: Counter-Strike's newborn. Weapon handling and Movement are nearly perfect. No Aiming down Sights (besides the Sniperrifles) and really hard Recoil/Bulletspread that you can learn to control. It has a hard learning curve but after some time you can get the hang of it. The competitve Matchmaking is really easy to use and you get most of the time people who are in your skill group. After 10 competitive wins you get thrown into a skillgroup. Now you can rank up or get downranked, depends on your skill ingame. You can collect Skins for you weapons. They don't have a advantage. There are some skins called Stattrak that you can just get through opening cases with a key. They have a little killcounter on the weapon that well, count your kills that you made with that weapon. Cases can drop , just like skins, after a match. (BUT NO AFTER EVERY MATCH AND THERE IS A DROP LIMIT PER WEEK!) If you really want a fancy dandy skin, like a M4A4 Asiimov or a special knife(rarest thing you can get) you can either gamble and open cases with bought keys, buy your favourite skins on the Steam market or use the trade-up contract. With the contract (that you can find in your Global offensive inventory ingame) you can trade 10 weapons from one collection for a new better quality weapon from that collection.

You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: Best cs ever so far, thanks to the Match Making system, and epic skins. Competitive mode finally brings possibility to play the game in the way how it always should have been played, without necessity of finding 9 people to play so called "MIX". The rank system finds a valid opponent for everyone, whether You are newb, or cspro You will have be matched against opponents at Your skill level, and comparing to other games with similar MM systems, this one in CS really works well, after like 100 games, 30 round game happens very often. The only thing I would like to see in game is 5v5 casual mode with rules like in competetive(so I could still play with my friends, who are banned for disconnecting).

review: One of the best and most populat FPS multiplayer games. I really like the style of game because it's really tactical. Game is also good for playing clan wars. Game mods are really nice and fun to play. Game won't become boring at all. I only don't like spawn system of players in team deathmatch because it's really bad. The good thing is that you can get some items in game which you can sell for real money on Steam and if you are lucky you can get pretty big amount of money. I really reccommend this game to everyone who like FPS multiplayer and action shooter games. Game is worth of money. 9/10

review: The Counter-Strike series are anything but noob-friendly, requiring you to do well your first two turns to keep expensive weaponry, to keep up your killing sprees. A steady eye is well-rewarded, even when you are behind. This is why many people who have played a few games in Counter-Strike just quit. It's too frustrating to end up every game last on the scoreboard, especially when you are match-made with people who do this for a living, and have been doing so for the last five years or so. However, after dying continuously, I found myself slowly rising higher on the scoreboards, having easier times guessing where enemies will be camping, and learning where to throw my smokes and flashes for optimal value. This feeling, when you no longer end up with a K/D of 0, but .75 instead, makes you want to do better. It makes you want to rise to the top elite, and it's something I haven't experienced with any other game before. For comparison, Team Fortress 2 is a really noob-friendly game, basically giving you a toolset with which you can literally do well without even looking their way (I am talking to you, gunslinger) or by only aiming in the general area your enemies are (Pyro). Counter-Strike is so much more rewarding than that, and it just feels so amazing getting better and better. It feels so amazing going into competitive and winning that match, with a point difference of 1. If you are thinking about buying this game, you should consider asking yourself, "Am I willing to change my lifestyle to fit this in?". If you won't, it will be a waste of money to buy this game, but if you will, it will be a waste of your life not buying it. This game is a kidnapper, and it'll give you Stockholm syndrome. 10/10 doesn't have hats.

review: Since I played 1.6 and stopped it, I thought I would never come back to a Counter-Strike game again.. I WAS WRONG! Saw the game on sale, flipped my  when I couldn't buy it when it was low and bought it at full price. 10/10 Anyway, it really brings the competitive scene that has been missing in Counter-Strike (for casual players). Matchmaking mode is really fun, especially when you get at least decent teammates. My friends list became twice larger ever since I started playing this game. I've had my laughs, I've had my cries in this game, but I still can't get enough of it. You constantly want to improve and get a bigger rank. There are also really good alternative versions of Matchmaking, called PUGS (Pick-Up Games). Really addictive for casual and competitive FPS players.

review: Counter-Strike Go brings a new element into the CS series that being the competitive aspect of it, as well as other different forms of game types. For the most part, the entire game play of CSGO is played around the competitive aspect of it. Competitive allows for a locked in game where you must verse your opponents in a 5v5 format. The matches allow for progression in ranks and intensified game play. CSGO also contains the animated community market that sells skins for guns and knives, unlike previous installments of CS. CSGO has its redefined graphics of classic CS maps which gives a brand new breath to the CS series, and for that I congratulate them. The shooting and the animation of the players is very vivid and realistic. Connection issues at times may harden the game play of the competitive side of it and trollers and smurfs linger behind much of the game. But regardless of that, CSGO stands out with its new features.

review: It has been more than ten years (Released in 1999) since the Counter-Strike franchise took off. Counter-Strike was first released by Valve on the Microsoft Windows platform in 2000. The game later spawned a franchise, and is the first installment in the Counter-Strike series. As of August 2011, the Counter-Strike franchise has sold over 25 million units. This game has made professional gamers you see today. As Valve released Counter-Strike: GO (Global Offensive) The franchise even got more popular. Earlier it was announced that Counter-Strike: GO was the second most played Valve game that they have ever made. Amazing! That show's how many people play and love this great game. I really recommend this game

review: People ask all the time "What makes this better than CS:Souce? Why should I buy this if I already have Counter Strike?" It's a good question. To be honest, it is, for the most part, the same game. Similar gameplay, Terrorists, Counter Terrorists, bombs, hostages... the whole deal. The graphics are updated, which is nice of course, they added bot AI, which helps to fill up teams when a bunch of people suddenly leave, and there are slight changes in the armory, as there are in each game (Riot Shields in Condition Zero, Molotovs in Global Offensive, etc.), but that's not what sets it apart. My favorite part of CS:GO is the options to help you quickly find a game, of any official gamemode, with actual players in it (and maybe some bots, too). The most agravating part of playing CS:S, CS:CZ, or any other version, is finding servers. "Okay, this one is a map and gamemode I'd like to play! Oh... there's no one here." "Oh look, a server with plenty of people in it! What the hell? Why do I run so fast? What's going on?! What is a "Surf" server?" "Okay, fine. One last server. If this doesn't work, I'm out. Okay, look promising so far... OH FFS! JAILBREAK AGAIN! I'm out." The worst part of this was that I never learned how to actually play Counter Strike! I understood that I needed to shoot the enemy, but I didn't know the strategies for the maps, how well each gun worked, or even where the bombsite really was! But no more! Since getting CS:GO, I've learned to play and actually enjoy Counter Strike! And it's really fun! Like, addictively fun! As in, I have a problem, please separate me from this game so I can focus on the important things! Nevermind, give it back! I wants it... the precious... Anyway, yeah. If you have no problem with playing nothing but community servers, there's no huge advantage to CS:GO. Some different weapons, new maps, some alternate gamemodes (Demolition is like Defuse, but smaller maps and more fast paced. It's really fun, actually!) And it has those Surf and Jailbreak mods in the community servers too, don't worry. If you want to play counterstrike for the sake of counterstrike, get this. If you just want it to play Garry's Mod and you have little interest in actual CS, just get Source. And whichever way you go, Enjoy!

If you are looking to not play any more games in the future, I recommend you to play this game. I have many hours on this game, and I don't regret it. Help. My family is looking for me and I don't want to leave my room.

Pay to get skins, pay to get knifes. Wish to unbox knifes, waste a key on a blue item. Risk your money to earn money, lose all of your items on betting. But in the end, pay to get more items. 12/10 - "Spend money simulator." PS: It's fun.

review: Skins. Angry humans. Funny humans. Insane things (even sometimes called "people" by their friends) Good for losing hope in humanity, then regaining it for a max of 2 random games, after about 5-9 games of starting to lose every hope you had, ever of humanity being good. (If you are planning to join the marines) This is realy good to semi-train your ears for unprovoked yelling. And ofc this is a fun game, even better if you are playing with friends... awsum sauce.

review: It may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps (Assault, anyone?), and little features of past games, but Global Offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking Counter-Strike for whoever wants it. Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.

When all of my friends started playing it, I picked it up so I could play with them. I love all of the weapons and maps that you can play on and the community adds even more. The level of teamwork and tactics in CS:GO is higher than any other online shooter out there which I really enjoy. I soon got caught up in this game and it is my go to shooter.

review: My friend told me to buy this game when i was playing another game on my computer. That game was pretty sweet, I played it for 2 hours. He's bad though so I'm not enjoying it, but it's not the game it's him. Then he bought the game for another friend and he's even worse, but that's okay because we can play against worse people with him. After a while my friend bought the game for another friend but he doesn't play it that much (he has 7 competitive wins lol wat a loser). This game is fun but the bullets dont fly where you want them too, which is bad. Valve please fix. I gave this game to my brother and he won't give it back, if you know a good way to give back game will you tell me plz? Thanks, I give this game a 9/11, buy you must (lel im like that green guy from the starwars). Can't live without.

review: This game honestly changed my life. Before playing I didn't know where to go, what to do. What do you do in the morning? Do you have to brush twice a day? How often do you wash your clothes, how much fabric softener is enough? So many questions and I was so lost. There were so many questions about life, yet no answers. Just when I was thinking about ending it all, I saw a post on a forum about this game that cost a little less than $5, I figured why not. After only 30 minutes of playing this game, I had answers. They weren't answers to questions I asked, but there were answers. In no time I had answers to questions like: Is rushing mid with negev a good strat? Should you always buy a decoy? Is walking necessary or can you full yolo all the time? Most important of all, I knew I could run faster with a knife. This not only helped me in game but in the real world as well. I got back into running and started jogging around my neighbourhood with a knife to maximize speed. Fast forward a few years and I was at my peak and winning awards. Everything went better than expected. Sincerely, Usain Bolt 6x Olympics Gold 100m & 200m runner

Also it's great spending 1.50 to open a crate you win ingame, where 99% of the time you will recieve a gun worth 2p. All players have 100HP. And it's great when you get 11 hits giving 99 damage to the enemy. Yet you get hit once and die. If you can withstand these frustrations. CS is the game for you! 9.7/10

If you're sick of  flashy shooters, and actually want to be considered good at a shooter that's universally accepted to be very difficult and have one of the highest learning curves... this game will definitely ruin your life. If you think "I USED TO BE LIKE BASICALLY PRO CS1.2 IMMA ROCK THIS GAME OFC" you should uninstall. Totally different game, . My opinion? Two thumbs up, ruined my life.

I know, it's sad that nothing can compete with Counter-Strike for over 12 years now, but that's the way it is. You don't want to be some kind of a scrub who's bad at competitive online games, right? They'll call you a n00b and a scrub and make fun of you if you don't get good at this game. So stop wasting your time playing casual garbage and pick up this game right now.

review: Having this being Valve's latest CS game made so far, I would say they did quite a good job on this one. More new guns, new maps, new game modes, new graphics and animations make this game even more fun to play. But what I HATE about this game is the fact that there are way TOO MANY hackers ruining all the fun. I can't really tell whether I would recommend this or not but if you have always liked the CS series so far, you'll definitely love this one!

Competitive Mode is a must-play for any serious player. In Competitive, you are put against players with your same skill level and you must battle it out to see who is the best. This game is phenomenal, everything about it is great. 9.2/10 Awesome Game!

review: I highly recommend this game. It's a very skill-based game. Skill, blended with gamesense, common sense, and lack of stupidity will take you far. Practice aiming in deathmatch or gungame, then hop into competetive mode to see how you rank against all the other players out there. Aim for headshots, they'll change the game. Use grenades effectively, they'll win rounds. Or blow up your teamates. With real recoil that takes learning and skill to combat, a wide variety of weapons for your personal tastes, and grenades that have the ability to provide huge advantages or losses, you won't find anything better for an online multiplayer game that challenges you. With a great compatibility for custom content on the workshop, and excellent support for those who design the popular content, you can't go wrong. Whether it's minigames, surfing, or bunnyhopping that you prefer, the workshop has it all. And probably dozens of other things I've never even imagined possible.

(hur dur big surprise) It is the most love/hate relationship on the planet. You'll keep coming back to the game because its fun. Then get  on by some tryhard, or a hacker. Dont get me wrong. Its a very fun game with some nice people to play with, but the amount of stupidity is just so high. If you enjoy yelling at teammates over the mic as you get insta domed by a smurf tryhard. This game is for you.

review: One of the, possibly THE best first person shooter out there. It's not full of un-neccessary animations that you'll find in other titles. The professional scene is outstanding, not as big as other titles like Call of Duty, which alledgedly has pro players, also known as a bunch of teens who trash talk in a game filled with aim assist. Valve never dissapoints, even with some nooks that need improvement, such as the tick rate, it is a title that delivers. The graphics are good. It is one of the most skill based games, and do not try to get good at this game by donating to get some powerful characters. Gunfights, action, tactics, strategy, anything that you would see in a war, this game delivers. I would give this a good rating, as the developers still have to do some work to satisfy some. There is a bit of work needed to perfect this game, and that bit is a point that I will be taking off of my rating. 9/10, would recommend, go out and get it now, if you do not like it, than you do not have the brain for a skill-demanding game. Unlike other developers that have their games die out in a few months, some, even weeks, the community for Counter Strike: Global Offensive keeps rising. Valve do not need to release a stupid sequel like some other publishers and developers do, they know how to satisfy the player, and they do not need so many DLC's that cost as much as the game. I have gone past my point, I think you can tell I am in love with it, I'd like to thank my brother for making me switch to this from the scum that is Call Of Duty.

review: Yeah.... I've been trying to get this game from some time. When i got it i realised that there were skins released in this and discovered that there are knifes and the most expensive knife can go to 500$ So i finally thought to sell my kidney and get a cool knife so that i can show off and the time is not far when my 2nd kidney will also be missing. Thats why i give it 5/5 . This game is 2 gud for a kidney , Its worth to sell one for knife and skins.It is so interesting that all kind of people will add you up to trade and they are quite interesting

review: The game is great. the only problem with the game is the tickrate. Tickrate is the way that servers in csgo refresh. by that I mean that every action you do is not the same thing in the demo. especialy on 64 tickrate. wich basicly Delays the game/make you look like a wallhacker/ and ect. 128 ticket pros you hit way more shots the movment is improoved because your game can refresh your actions faster and the cons of 128 ticket. fps issues pros of 64 tick. uhhh everything is delayed so it takes longer to a player to react to your movment and high fps cons of 64tick Hit Registration .

The thing is, many players are extremely far apart in terms of skill, but you'll never have to worry about being matched with them. Could use some slight tweaks, but very good. Highly reccomended.

review: This is probably the best shooter ever made. CS:GO has anything that was in the previous versions of CS, plus it adds awesome skins and item drops like crates. If you're lucky enough you can get rare items dropped, which you then can sell on the market. That being said, you not only have an awesome shooter with millions of maps, plenty game mods and brilliant matchmaking. In CS:GO you also have a cash-cow. Go idling, milk the cow, if you're lucky you'll get an awp skin. Or a knife model. In that case, you can quit your job and lay back.

review: It started back in the 8th grade when I was put in ELL. I was surrounded by  and no matter how much I begged the principal to let me out of there he kept telling me I was also  and there was no way I would suceed in life. I spent days in the ELL classroom learning with people I hated and puzzles I couldn't solve. Coloring inside the lines was not only unacheiveable but I had to watch the coolest kid in ELL Eli Chubin do every day. It wasn't fair I wasn't like the rest of these kids I could do 20 pull ups! If the principal wouldn't advance me to regular classes I would have to it myself. Using the problem solving skills that landed me in ELL I devised the plan to kill every other person in the class because then I have to be moved up, I mean they couldn't have a class just for 1 person right? I searched online to find out how other people did mass murders and it seemed like the most efficient way was with shooting the place up so I decided that was what I would do. I didn't know where to start though so I searched online once again to find out how all these murderers started. I quickly learned that it was violent video games was the thing that all these murderers had in common so I decided that must be the thing that makes killers. I then bought Counter Strike as I heard you could learn how to be a terrorist and played it every day after school. After a week of playing I felt the evil inside of me and I was ready to shoot up the school. Using what I had learned from Counter Strike and the guns I borrowed from my father I went into ELL that day and killed every kid in my class. As a result of that I got moved up into regular classes just like I hoped would happen. Without Counter Strike I would still be in ELL to this day.

review: I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of this game. 1/10 score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Valve Game Submission Contract. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Terrorist slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But two years later, the Terrorist is still is not free. Two years later, the life of the Terrorist is still sadly crippled by the manacles of the M4A1-S and the chains of Counter-Terrorists. Two years later, the Terrorist lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. Two years later, the Terrorist is still languished in the corners of Counter-Terrorist society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition. In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Trade-Up Contract, they were signing a promissory note to which every player was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, Terrorist men as well as Counter-Terrorist men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable Rights" of "Deagle, AWP, and the pursuit of Bomb Sites." It is obvious today that Counter Strike has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her players of Terrorism are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, Counter Strike has given the Terrorist people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds." But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this game. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of Deagle and the security of AWP. 10/10 would let freedom ring again

review: I absolutely LOVE CSGO. I remember going over to my cousin's house when I was younger and saw him playing either CS or CSGO and always begged him to let me play. He never did, but 5 years later I finally got the game and got to join in on the fun. This game is amazing. I love the communication aspect of it and the community (most of the time). It's worth the money. (: Recommend 110%!

review: In this game you can point and click to kill people, and win a free iPhone*! It also features many great maps including Dust II and Dust II. This game can be very difficult for new players as it features people who are really good, they can get running head shots with an ak-47 from CT to B double doors on the best map, Dust II. It also features a skin system similar to TF 2's item system but skins aren't really usefull they just look nice, and allow you to show off how much money you can throw at people. *No iPhones can actually be won from playing this game, major rage and saddness may occur, please seek a medical proffesional before deciding to use this product.

review: CS:GO is my favorite game on steam so far. As far as competitive gaming goes, look no further than Counter-strike or Dota. Counter-strike is a game where the outcome is based on each player's skill, reaction time, and TEAMWORK! Communication with your fellow soldiers is crucial to win. Calling strategies, reporting enemy whereabouts, and working closely with teammates makes this game more immersive than most PC shooters. Make sure you follow your team's economy to decide what gear to buy at the right times. Learn common locations on all the maps so you can keep your team aware of all happenings around them. It also helps that the game's mechanics are about as fluid as it gets! Have fun.

review: Its a good follow up to the classic Counter-Strike 1.6. Game feels good and have been improved together with the professional teams. The only downside is that you cannot choose region or language and some problems occur as follows. Russians mostly are matched up with english speaking players, and they have overall bad english or no english at all. The Valve servers currently run at 64tickrates/second wich makes the competitive match making abit luck based sometimes. CDkey's are very cheap in Russia and this is a problem when many players abuse it to cheat with a n account. Skins on weapons and knifes are really good and brings some trading into it wich makes the community flourish around this aspect aswell.

I've found that many people will often be easily frusterated and angered with this game, especially when continuously losing competitive matchers. For me personally, however, I find that I've always enjoyed this game (especially the skin and trading market), and even when I'm losing, I still enjoy doing it! Could not recommend more.

review: This "review" is directed to those who had 1.6 or CS: Source. CS: GO is exactly what a sequel should have been: A user interface and graphics overhaul. There's little gameplay changes. There are some other grenades including an incendiary and a decoy. There's still 4 buttons to move, a button to jump, a button to crouch, and no  with other moves from other modern shooters like health regen or cover system. Move the mouse around and shoot. There's no ironsights  either with the exception of the two weapons in CS 1.6 that did feature the "older version of ironsights", the AUG and Krieg. In this version you actually aim through the sights but it makes sense, right? CS: GO remains an old school FPS. However, because CS: GO is a graphics overhaul, this also means the game levels have much more "noise". It can be hard to distinguish enemies from the background. There's a machmaking system that puts you into a competitive environment with 30 rounds to play, 15 rounds in each side, 5v5. If competitive pressure isn't a thing for you, there's still the casual (and usual) server browsing and quick play button to play some 8v8+ games with tons of money each round and friendly fire and player blocking disabled. For all that is not related to the core of the game, there's some lighter hearted game modes with quicker pace like deathmatchs. As for the in-game economy, all items that can be acquired are for cosmetic purposes only. There is NO item you can add onto your weapon that affects gameplay. It's just all paint jobs and stickers, and a stupidly expensive toy that counts how many kills you have done with your weapon. If anything it just makes your enemies more visible because of that white and orange $47 AWP they're holding.

review: Amazing and Really well made piece of work,just like all other Valve games. But in my opinion skins are kind of overpriced.Before CS:GO, I thought that Team Fortress 2 have too expensive items (10 euros for hats,weapons e.t.c) But now i see this (knives - 200 euros,weapons - 70 euros). So CS:GO oficially took the TF2's crown of items being expensive as F U C K.

review: At the momment the only competitive FPS game with some of the good implementetions when it comes to matchmaking and also playing with your friends. Has very steep learning curve when it comes to weapons ( recoil, spread etc.). I would reccomend this game unless you are anoyed by next few things i am about to mention. First and foremost, Russians. Very annoying, trying to communicate in their native language even if it not a international language. Words they use, blyet, sukha. Second problem, kids. Because of this game i decided i will NEVER have kids, they are god awful creatures if you give them PC-s and a bad headset. Tend to scream and curse, even when not provoked. Of course "block communication" is a viable option but then you exlude one of the biggest parts of this game out of it. Still i like the game and i think it would worth you a while to buy it and play it. Added on 2014.10.17 After so many hours, i have found a fundamental flaw with this game. It is called the "a cooldown period". What it does basically is punsihing you for leaving game, killing team mates or dealing damage to your team mates. Also if you lose connection you will be spanked by valve. Why is this a flawed system, well i will explain that with as few words as possible. First of all is noobnes level of the players i play with *silver. You may throw grenade and he might run into it and die, of course who gets punished, YOU. Again russians and how ly persistant they are. If you say B, you can almost guarantee he wil go on A screaming at the same time ", BLYET, OBAMA BAD". So eventually you are forced to kill him, take the bomb and plant. I wrote this review in hope to get some feedback because i play 2-3 matches and then back to 7 day period cooldown. I honestly hope to get some suggestions aty least, and i hope you will find this usefull.

review: As a real life soldier this potreys a very very real feel, I once had my buddy's legs blown off from an IED. On his death bed I sent him a box, he didn't have a key though so he had to pay me about tree fiddy. Well he opened it and got a StatTrak Karambit Case Hardened, he's also dead now. Not from the IED. Don't let your war buddies open boxes kids.

review: Every Friday after I recieve my paycheck I deposit it. Saturday mornings I wake up not remebering the previous night with a headache and a sore . I roll out of my bed on to the floor and pick myself up just enough to click play on CSGO, I spend the time that it takes me to load CSGO (NO SSD MASTER RACE HERE) getting up from my starting position to sit in my chair (very hard to do with a wrecked bottom) Naturally at this time I start to remeber certain details about the previous night. I check my phone, a text from my bank, I've overdrawn. My Foggy bits and pieces start to clear and gradually turn to horror as I see a little yellow box with a 10 in it under the word inventory, and a message telling me i have new items. I click inventory as i am suddenly overcome with the dawning realization of my previous nights activities as my shiny new Stat Trak skins bounce into view on my screen. so much red. I lose control of my bowels and also vomit all over my keyboard and screen then pass out. If you buy this game. it would be smart to also buy some lube, in bulk, Dont play CSGO if you dont want your anal region violated again and again. game mechanics .... crap teamwork... crap community of friendly people for beginners... crap but u can buy skins for your gunz to make them look pretty so you spend your entire time distracted by the colors while you get shot at and lose the game for your team Valve is a cruel, cruel mistress. I Can't ING WAIT FOR SATURDAY MORNING. 10/10 will buy lube again.

review: So after playing Counter Strike for about 1 year now and putting over 1000 hours into it, I thought I would make a little review. Throughout the time i've played I've seen many Good/Bad changes made to the game. I still think some of the changes are a little stupid but I've come to get used to it. Although there are a lot of cheaters I still manage to have fun. Whenever I encounter a cheater I just laugh and mess around with them, because it's funny to think people would waste 15$ on re-buying the game for multiple accounts to cheat on. I was recently reading a reddit post by a proffesional CS:GO player by the name of DaZeD in where he mentions a way that can reduce cheaters by a mass amount of numbers. He basically stated that CS:GO should add a system so that the first 50 queues are unranked so the cheaters would basically be going against other cheaters. He also said that after you finish the first 50 queues you can start playing for ranks and start playing on 128 tic servers. I agree with all of what he said. This was originally going to be a small review and it turned into a little over a paragraph. If you actually read all of this and have any opinions leave a comment letting me know, and I'll try to get back to you.

review: Hey, i am just curious if anyone else does this. Every day when i take a shower, i like to turn the water super hot, hold my nuts in my hand and let the scalding hot water run over them. Lately my balls have been extremely itchy for some reason, so instead of itching them, i burn them with scalding hot water to relieve the itching and it is quite possibly the most amazing sensation i've ever felt in my life. It feels amazing and i'm doing less damage to the skin than if i were to scratch them. I just have to be careful because the hot water hitting my hand or my thighs hurts really bad so it can be difficult to only let the scalding hot water hit my nuts and nothing else. As i've been doing this, the itching has gotten less intense as the days go on so the treatment seems to be working. I know it's weird but i'm telling you it feels incredible. I'm not saying other people should try it, but if you've got an itch, perhaps a better alternative is to burn them with scalding hot water. Posted: 19 April 2014

I get placed with a team of trolls and idiots whilst the other team consists of 3 smurfs DMG on main. ing cheers valve. This game is unique and the gameplay and mechanics are fantastic. However the game is dragged down by screaming children and trolls. I'm silver 3 with 97 wins and about 90% of my friends that are terrible at the game are a higher rank. I'm not amazing but I'm pretty decent. I top frag every game and I still don't rank up. Yesterday, I played one game. My team were a bunch of 12 year olds and trolls and I was up against 2 smurfs. Thanks. I get kicked, because the trolls think it's funny to kick people for no reason and then guess what? The rank I just worked 40+ wins to get is gone. ing gone. I'm done with this game. My ranking system is glitched/ed and my matchmaking system is . Why am I so unlucky? Just why. ing unbelievable.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the fourth in the series of The Counter Strike FPS games. But is it worth the money? What Is Counter-Strike?: Counter-Strike is a FPS game based around 2 main gamemodes, Bomb Defusual and Hostage Rescue. In Bomb Defusual there are two teams consisting of 5 players each, the terrorists and the counter-terrorists, players who die will not respawn till the next round. The terrorists have to plant a bomb on one of the two bomb sites or kill the entire enemy team to win and the counter-terrorists need to either kill the enemy team before they plant the bomb or defuse the bomb before it explodes. In hostage rescue there are, again the same two teams consisting of 5 players each, however there are no bombs to be planted here, instead the terrorists need to defend the hostages the counter-terrorists are trying to free. Graphics: The graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are a big improvement over the ones in Counter-Strike: Source however are still a few years out of date as the Source Engine can only handle so much. Weapons: Counter-Srike: Global Offensive is a big improvement from the old Counter-Strike: Source guns. In Counter-Srike: Source there were very few competitive weapons, however in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive there seems to be a bigger variety of ballenced, fun to use weapons both casually and competetively. Gamemodes: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive adds two new gamemodes to the mix, Arms Race and Demolition. Arms race is Counter-Strikes Version of the highly popular Gun Game, it is a free-for-all gamemode where getting a kill ranks you up to the next weapon. To win you need be the first to go through all the guns and get a final kill with the golden knife. Demolition is a twist on the original Bomb Defusual, the terrorists need to plant a bomb in a building whilst the counter terrorists need to either stop them from planting it or defuse the bomb before it goes off, however there's a twist, much like Arms Race you need to get a kill to rank up to the next weapons, getting more than one kill will grant you extra grenades for the next round, the team that wins the most rounds wins. Competetive: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a massively competetive game adding skill emblems that and a seperate matchmaking system just for competetive. The skill emblems are reanks that increase the more competetive wins you get, they also determine who you get put with in the competetive matchmaking. There sadly only a few maps for competetive play and lots are in favour of one of the teams. These are my opinions on a few of the maps: Dust 2 is fairly T sided. Inferno is CT sided. Nuke is CT sided. Train is CT sided. Aztec is CT sided. etc. Camo's and cases: The case system is a new addition to the game, there are crates that you can find by playing the game, trade for, or buy off the market, there require a key to open which cost around 2 and when opened give you a random camo. The camo's are purely cosmetic items that are reskins of the original arsenal, the value of the camo may vary depending on the gun the camo is for, the quality tier of the camo, the look of the camo itself and how rare of a drop it is. Verdict: Counter-Strike: Global offensive is a huge improvement over the already great Counter-Strike: Source that adds lots of new content such as gamemodes, weapons, maps and the new case system and is a huge bargain at the low price of 14.99$, 13,99 and 11.99 8.5/10

review: Counter-Strike is my all time favorite game. I have spent countless hours in competitive play and enjoy the hell out of the systems in place. It's unlike any other MP game out there and has not been matched in the FPS genre. Developers are dedicated to the community, albiet on their own pace. You can play for hours and hours and still not perfect the game. It is a living, breathing game that continued to develop and grow both in the community and the game itself. SO much has changed since the late 90s in video games, but there are those few exceptions that last through out the various shifts in video games. Counter-strike is one of them.

review: I've wasted a lot of time in this game. I think, I finally can say my own opinion. First of all, this game doesn't have an optimisation. Even though, you have a very powerful computer, it still will be lagging as  as it's possible. Secondly, VAC Anti-cheat doesn't work properly. There are many cheaters and what's very important, Valve doesn't give a ! In addition, the rank system in this game is totally unfair. You can be de-ranked for no reason. Also, there can be some people who have very low rank but they still can play like the global elite players( I don't mean about people who have the second account with low rank). Furthermore, the real community of this game consists of the ing idiots who cannot play well and they can only complain for some . As well as, annoying and pulling whole team down can be made by them. Unfortunately, it's really hard to find someone who can play well and without any doubt, show the real meaning of teamplay. By the way, about those things like the skins or something like this that don't make any sense. Valve is trying to get some money in the different ways. Especially, it's associated to the ing crates and keys. I completely don't recommend you to buy them, you'll actually lose money. In conclusion, this game definitely sucks and it can lead you to get a brain cancer. What's really funny that I will never stop playing this . Probably, I am already addicted. Here is a small advice for Valve: Valve, you are supposed to do something useful for this game that can really improve it.

review: CS GO Jogabilidade: Regular Grficos: Bom Segurana (VAC): Ruim Som: Regular Interao: Pessima Mdia do jogo: Ruim - Jogabilidade (Modo Competitivo): Os jogadores usam hackers, cheaters dentre outros meios de se beneficiar, a Valve sabe disso e nao faz nada a respeito, Inuria  o hacker mais conhecido 80 R$ por ms. (Modo Casual,Deathmatch e outros) Bem divertido pra descontrair, desde que tome cuidado com os jogadores que sempre querem ser os melhores e ficam rushando sem nenhum conceito de jogabilidade e senso de trabalho em equipe. -Interao: Voc  expulso das partidas se no souber jogar o jogo, todos que te matam, humilham voc, so preconceituoso, no tem educao necessria para respeitar outros jogadores, principalmente os brasileiros, so os piores jogadores de CS ou qualquer jogo online, s sabem chingar e falar mal dos outros, no respeitam ningum e so quase todos prepotentes, inexperientes e sem nenhum senso de jogabilidade. -Grficos: Source 2 Graphic Engine, leve, sem muitos bugs, rodar sem nenhum problema nos computadores mais bsicos, verificar requisitos abaixo. -Segurana: Provavelmente um dos piores ant cheaters que ja foram criados  o VAC, decadente,  ridiculo como uma empresa to grande e to poderosa financeiramente no consegue impedir o uso de cheaters em seus games. -Som: Boa qualidade de audio ambiental, com um bom equipamento pode-se ouvir o inimigo distante, at usando a luneta dos rifles snipers, pssima recepo do som das armas, quem procurar um simulador de tiro FPS no espere muito de CS GO, pois o som dos disparos  deprimente. Quem quiser se aventurar mais em um bom jogo de tiro recomendo Insurgency [insurgent]

review: Coming back after a long hiatus from the CS 1.3-1.5 days, I started playing Source occasionally. After finding some cool people and servers that made the game fun again, I was pulled back into CS and those long gaming sessions. Then I noticed there was a newer version called GO. I didn't really know what to expect from CS:GO but I had to give it a try. At first, it felt very different and I was put off by that. It felt like I was lost in the maps, and that I'd never figure them out because of headshot after headshot. I was dying almost instantly. So I started playing Deathmatch for a few rounds now and then, just to get a feel for the guns and see if I'd get a loot drop. Mainly I stuck to Source. Eventually I started getting pretty good at Deathmatch. I made a few friends and found some regular community servers I enjoyed. From there, the game really began to grow on me. Now I'm enjoying the Competitive mode. Overall, the game no longer feels all that different from Source. The movement and pace is faster, the maps are all familiar but nicely revamped, and the graphics are really good... but at the heart of it, CS:GO is still very much the CS that we all know and love. Going back to Source, now that I'm used to GO, feels very dated and slow. This was a needed update, and one I'm thankful for. CS:GO is an excellent version of our favorite game. If you're still playing Source on a regular basis, you really should consider checking out GO, and not just one or two rounds. Give the game a good shot at winning you over. Like me, I think you'll find that it's the best version yet.

review: Awesome FPS game to play with your friends online. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.

review: Counter-Strike at its most competitive oriented beauty. Pros: - competetive match making - stable Valve servers - more guns - customization Cons: - No official Valve servers in Japan(?) - Not being able to play just classic or other mods (all servers are too far = bad ping) - Competitive maps being stack on dust and nuke (couldn't played any other maps yet) I just wish Valve balanced its gaming servers properly worldwide, so we can play with low ping and hopefully other mods.

review: When a friend told me there was a game that let players re-enact the well-known modern skirmishes of Dust 2, Nuke and Vertigo, I couldn't believe any game developer would have the audacity to create such turbulent moments in contemporary political history. Valve's Counter Strike: Global Offensive allows people to play through the scenarios the real counter-terrorism squads had to operate in and, for me, it has really been an eye opener. I'd recommend this game to any person who's studying a course based on inter-pol or counter-insurgency history as well as to those who are just into realistic shooter sims. Re-live the intense close-quarter engagements that our trained elites had to go through!

The game makes you rely on only your skills and knowledge of the game, no "levels" or upgrading guns. Just you and your gun, the same guns your enemy has. This makes for a brutally difficult yet fun multiplayer game to play.

review: What's so amazing with CS is that it has now been around for 14 years! And it's still stong and will probably keep being strong for the next decade as well. It's such a simple concept. 2 teams, one team defend the bombsite another attack it. It's amazing how thrilling it can be to play and watch CS. CS:GO is definitly the new fresh air that the CS franchice needs. The graphics are better, competitive play, "official" skins etc. There is only improvment coming from Valve and it'll probably become even a better game as the years go by. It's a great game and if you like the previous or any CS games I strongly suggest you pick this game up! 10/10

The fact that you can find weapon skin and crates, is awesome too. If you dont care about the skins/crates, just sell them on the market! i just found a gun worth 40 cents about 20 mins ago! and a crate worth 1.20!!!! buy this game... its super fun.

review: Well.. how to start... I'm counterstrike boy starting from v 1.3. Big fan of CS all the way, it's my favourite game. When CS:GO showed up, i was really sceptic about that game, that's why i didn't bought it in 2012. CS:GO is one of the best FPS games you can find right now on the market. It's really balanced, from every pistol, shotgun, smg. You can kill with anything, weapon is not so much important, as in 1.6, where mostly you heard sounds of AK, Deagle, or AWP. As for me,even if i played more then 2000 hrs of CS 1.6 it was really complicated in my first matches, since textures and graphics changed a "bit". But it's not really that hard to get used to engine, graphics. I really like the competitive system, since i remember that pain in  called "mIRC" :D I'd recommend to buy the game at all costs.

review: Counter Strike GO is the return to the beloved Multiplayer shooter game Counter Strike but will you want to play the new one or stick to the Classics ? Of course everybody knows what Counter Strike is about. Essiantly Counter terrorist and terrorist fight and each of them have diffrent objectives. Honestly i love this game. The gameplay is way faster, tighter and way smoother than ever. The gunplay and awesome and you feel highly rewarded when youre on a killing spree. The game has a few modes and all of them are fun for theyre own reasons There are some problems that need fixing. The hit detection isnt always the best sometimes when you shoot the enemy square right in the face the shot doesnt connect. Overall the game is really fun and i enjoyed it alot and if you liked the previous Counter Strike games you need to own this title. I give Counter Strike Global Offensive a 8/10

review: Counter Strike Global Offensive is an excellent first person shooter in every way possible. The community is for the most very good and friendly. One of the best aspects of this game is the competetive mode where you and 4 other friends can play versus other players around the globe while you rank up and earn new camos for your weapons. Some elements of this are not so good like problems with lag and disconnecting depending of what part of the world you live in (probably will get fixed). I will recommend CSGO very much to the avid fps gamer and it is a must in your steam collection!

The trading is much more simpler, more far, and more desired(and isn't controlled as much by people who just want to make their bp worth more so it compensates for their lack of a girlfriend or for their small ). the physics are less whacky due to recoil and require much more precision than tf2. even tho there are only like 30 maps, its still fun. 11/10 flutterdoges would reccomend as well

review: Best FPS released in the past few years at least. Gameplay oriented, rather than trying to look pretty. It runs poorly on low or mid-spec PCs, and at the highest ranks on matchmaking there are lots of cheaters, but this can be (mostly) avoided through alternatives like PUGs [altpug, leetway, ESEA] or league games where much fewer people seem to be cheating. Nonetheless, fantastic game.

review: One of the finest LAN games Ive played. Expertly crafted and refined and far more accessible to new players than previous incarnations. The new Demolition mode is quick and intense, with smaller maps sporting just one bomb site while plenty of varied cover guarantees exciting firefights. This mode is excellent for new players as everyone is given full armour and a gun at the beginning of each round (starting with the AK/M4). If you get a kill, next round you get a different, typically less versatile, gun for the next round (with grenades being awarded for multiple kills). This auto balances teams excellently as the most effective players have the worse guns while the new players spend longer with the easier ones. Theres the added bonus that when playing with bots, you can take control of them when youre out. All in all, this is the finest CS there is. With smoother, more varied gameplay, better sound and graphics, and a wealth of high quality, free content in the steam workshop. Worth every penny.

review: Have you ever wanted to be a car, kid? Well now you still can't but you can cry yourself to sleep over the rounds you dropped, the friends you let down, and the relationships that you destroyed on CS:GO. Also, this game came in first at the Iowa state fair of 1945 for it's help in the Manhattan Project at Trinity. This game has a half-life to that similar to that of Carbon-14, and is now being used for carbon dating techniques based on your win/loss ratio on Vertigo. Whenever a bomb is thrown off of the side of the map, the Carbon-14 deposits plummet by the IQ of the closest spider to the Dalai Lama.

review: I now have over 1.2k hours on all of my accounts combined and it's still as fun as the day I bought it, if not even more. I love Counter Strike Global Offensive and can see myself playing this game for years on end. This is the most value I have gotten for my money ever. I encourage any person either pro or just got on pc, buy Counter Strike Global Offensive, there is a spot for every one here. This means either pro scrims, or pick up games with people on your skill level.

review: This is just a marketing game, even it's named Global Offensive, so its abbreviation come out as GO (DAT MARKETING SKILLS THO), nothing global in this game (although there are some new maps that take place in a different part of the world), but if you liked the CS 1.6, you'll defenitelly like this as much, because the developers were too afraid to adapt any new mechanincs in the game, even the ridiculous ladder climbing remained the same. (They could have made an animation for climbing, but many say that that would slow the gameplay, but not if the character would step two ladder rungs instead of one, or something like this) It's just looks horrible among the few realistic mechanisms But while they tryied to implement realism (the way you have to aim with the scope with rifles) the aiming system is still... well... "undeveloped" to me. It's a good thing that the most liked maps like dust and assault are still in it, and they are all improved with destroyable doors, barrels and other objects, and in the game, not all weapons works the same way, that's a good thing again! This is why it's hard to say wheter I recommend it or not. I, of course recommend from an aspect that many players bougth the game, the 1.6 version were so popular, I BET you have a friend on your list who play this game, but in the other hand this game is nothing but a poor work making new source of money in my opinion. But saying positive again for conclusion, I'm an audiophile, and I LOVE its music, the music system is very well made, when you get killed the dramatic music kicks in and so on, and I can't complain about its graphics if I look away from the animations. Overall, yes, I recommend this game.

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.

review: Alright, 64 Tick sucks. I hate Matchmaking. ---------------------------------------------------- Spend a month saving 2 Cent skins to buy a key and open one of those thousand cases stockpiled up in your invtentory, You get a Bizon. Yeah, (Out of the 12 cases I've opened so far my best skin was an Aug Stat Trak Wings I swear if I get a knife my addiction for saving up to open a case will be done. ---------------------------------------------------- Game will make you stab yourself, Move people who are from Venezuela will get mad at you for doing bad. But I have alot of people from Venezuela who are my friends and they are very nice! Theres usually always going to be an  on your team. ---------------------------------------------------- There will be a 4/50 Chance you will go into a game and find a hacker, or someone will toggle. You are sometimes judged on where you live, and btw this is to anyone who lags, I'll always have sympathy on you. When I played a source 10 man once with a guy who always bugged me for lagging, TKed me all the time. Then the whole team would turn on me, I hated that so much. ---------------------------------------------------- Opening cases is a fools game,2/10 You will get a good skin. So for me loosing 2.49 Is like loosing a knife... Yeah I'm always heartbroken.. ---------------------------------------------------- I saved up for the full Candy Apple set in Factory New. I love the skins, They're my only nice looking ones c: ---------------------------------------------------- The community isn't as bad as CoD because you are less likely to find anyone who trolls out there, Not that I hate trolls, I find them amusing. Sometimes I see people who will make fun of the other team for being Asian and Mexican. I was called a French Fortune Cookie once, It hurt my feelings. ---------------------------------------------------- The chickens in this game are fun to play with if you rub them with your left hand while holding a smoke grenade, just make sure you don't throw the smoke at the chicken, It will implode. ---------------------------------------------------- Counterstrike is lovely. I love it dearly. The game has no where else to go like TF2. So there wont be another sequel in a long time, What I'm saying is that. The Market has stopped it from changing. But what's beautiful is the British SAS's Voice... It's so ing sexy, "BISH BASH BOSH" "SNEEKY BEEKY LIEK" Who the hell voiced them! The voices are amazing in this game! I wanna know I really want to know! ---------------------------------------------------- I will never abandon this game, I want to get into a team some day. I'll have to grow a bit first but. It's really good... The FragMovies, Players, Teams... Such a nice game! --------------------------------------------------- gimme da pusi boss (Good skins)

review: Excellent chicken murder sim runs great on windows 21 but it crashed my computer 8 times in a row Story and charater development remain good as always but the open world aspect was toned down when bethesda threatened them with a knife Play as 1 of 1 classes: Gunner Weapons are randomly generated and can spawn for both slots: Pistol or Primary Matches are hectic and can last from 25 seconds to 2 years There's also a new minigame everytime you reload your knife that lets you fight several enemies rpg-style only using QTE's which improves the already spectacular immersion Accuracy with the unlockable crossbow for the " me with a screwdriver" DLC pack for only 70$ adds a spectacular level of immersion as weilding it instantly wins the game in your favor The pholgistinator for engineer is the best unlock as it shoots watermelons and disembodied  This game only has one flaw: Its 1$ price tag 2pricy4mebruh Also the playerbase is not full of shitwhippers 40/1

review: This game captures the essence of the original Counter Strike in many ways. It's quite exciting that the core gameplay was fully retained, and that makes it exceptionally fun for me- you can run around and play without having to memorize new maps. Some new features are also added like ranking, ranked matches, and several others. Some downsides are, they ruined de_Aztec, no more sprays, and you play dust 2 CONSTANTLY in ranked. You can de-select it, but then it just essentially goes to the next popular map, nuke...

review: Overall, it's a REALLY REALLY REALLY GREAT game. The graphics are good, very epic gameplay, and has a realistic physics. Even though, sometimes, it has problems like, server crashing, lagging and more. Everything is GOOD. But there is ONE problem i don't really like, the competitive cooldown. I am really against this cooldown because i had cooldown once, but not once, many times already! It makes me mad because it make me down, just because I can't play CSGO Competitive. Well, I wish Valve remove this competitive cooldown system, It's for people who have problems on their internet, just like me. Not only for them but for all of us! :). In that case, the game will be much better.

review: Counter-strike: Global Offensive is the best game to buy on Steam ATM. It has everything that you would want from a game: NO PAY2WIN! Ofcourse you can buy things but those things give no advantages. Like Skins. The AWP Asiimov doesn't give you +100% Rate of fire or something, it's only for a decoration. CS:GO Is right now my second most played game on Steam. This game is super fun but it does have some problems, like the 64 TICK SERVERS! 64 Tick servers are mostly ValvE Servers. Sometimes you hit the dude 30 times and only does about 19 dmg. Not spraying. That's why you should play on Community servers like altPUG, FaceIT or something. Not ESEA. But if you want to pay for a company to mine bitcoins with your graphics card go ahead! Have fun! Otherwise the game is perfect. 10/10 Recommend buying on a sale. Not for the full price ;D If you buy it on a sale then buy some keys and crates and try to get a knife. :D I also reccomend watching WarOwl's videos on how to improve. Helped me a lot!

review: CS:GO is the most recent entry to the counter strike series, if you're not famillar with this series, its an online tactical first person shooter, developed by the good old people at valve, with hidden path entertainment helping with this entry. it comes with much improved graphics compared to previous entries.. you must be precise and tactical with your movements, the most satisfying thing about this game is mastering the huge learning curve it comes with, and be warned this game is difficult compared to other shooters on the market, but once you become a master at pulling off clean headshots with ease, mastering each each weapon.. trust me you'll be satisfied! Plus the game has workshop support, various skins for each weapons, new versions of classic counter strike maps (dust, office etc.) new game modes are introduced, whilst classic game modes return, and at a fair price, you could do alot worse, Definite Must Buy!

game-hours: 2557.6
review: Certainly a game you have to stick at for a while to have any sort of fun with! More often than not I am frustrated by my inability to hit simple targets due to the way recoil works; for people like me it can be a brilliant game one moment and horrible the next. The player base in match making seems mostly comprised of people who's main aim in life is to tell you how much you suck at video games and generally treat you with contempt and unfriendliness, but if you play with friends and ignore the unpleasant mob, you can find a rewarding game, and even some genuinely friendly people who are there to help you improve or just have fun in bad situations. Before jumping into competitive, it's probably wise to familiarise yourself with the rules, as friendly fire and dodgy internet connections alike can result in temporary bans. The graphics are quite nice, some of the voice work is a bit weird to me, but often a source of hilarity.

review: Its like tf2 with gun skins instead of hats Bought this game for like 2 keys, then i ended up getting up turning this game into a money maker. With all the things i got from this game, i managed to buy a copy of Goat Simulator (amazing game), and have some keys to blow off and unbox, and have some nice  StatTraks to play around with. i turned those 2 keys into at least over $50 in total. Making skins in this game is a fun thing to do also, hopefully one day one of my skins will be accepted into the game

review: A Tactical Shooter that involves communication between players. Communication in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is very important and I strongly reccomend you this game if fristly you have the patience to learn and succeed. There are many mechanics that frist must be identified and learnt before you can play well. If you have the patience to hone these skills, and communicate freely this game might be for you.

review: This game is a nice tactical shooter. Meta-game is really big. It takes a long time to get into if you've never played a CS type game before, but it's pretty fun once you get to the ~30 hour mark and start playing competetive. You have to be pretty rich to afford this game in the long run though because of all the broken keyboards when playing matchmaking with randoms, and opening cases will drain your paypal account faster than you can say ''StatTrak Butterfly Knife | Fade''.

review: There has been a great deal of controversy on whether the game fulfilled the peoples' expectations and whether it deserves to be considered as worthy as its ancestors. Many positive points to be noticed: Great graphics (for a cs game) and Satisfying gameplay that can make you unable to stop playing, especially if playing with friends. On the negatives, compared to the previous titles, it has many things that devs could fix/improve. Plus, the matchmaking system is not working as expected, and as it seems, no serious efforts are made to change that. Last but not least, i have to point that the cs go community is likely the worst. Still, worth buying. 7/10 nearly 700 hours of gameplay (multiple accounts)

review: This game is the best! I would perfer it anyday over Source or "GAY-V.A." It combines a skill game with a mostly mature community to make a wonderful game. I would recommend this game highly. It will take you a little bit to learn the recoil but once you get it you'll be having a lot of fun!
game-hours: 353.4
review: Possibly the greatest shooter series ever. Forget CoD forget Battlefield, this is where the skill and fun really is at. It just has so much replay value it's unbelieveable, it's good that they've included all the old CS weapons and their weapon sounds and maps. Counter strike is a very tactical game so spraying won't work, if your are a CoD noob and want to play this game, learn how to master trigger control first. Game is very enjoyable and I cannot recommend this game enough!! :)

review: This game, unlike most fps games now, actually requires skill and coordination to win. you and your team have to work together to acheive a common objective in a series of fun maps that encourage both close and long range fire-fights.

review: There's a lot I could say about CS:GO currently, with the new updates and all. If you're not one for change, stick to CS:S or 1.6, as right now CS:GO now has a market system which many older players find horrible. I personally like it, because it's optional. Yes, Valve will try to force it on you with crate drops and collections, yet the base game is of course amazing. They've added in a fair number of new weapons, for example, the PP-Bizon replaces the MP5 and the M4A4 (and the M4A1-S stock weapon) replaces the regular M4A1 Maverick. Scopes on AUGs and SIGs have been updated, and grenades can be thrown underhand. Also, aiming with respect to movement has changed. Recoil patterns are now slightly random. Looking past all of the changes and adapting would be for the best, seeing as how right now this is the most played version of the series. Old players will find their way on their own, and eventually either keep playing casually on a (non-valve) server or they can use the Classic Competitive gamemode to participate in a pick-up game, or they can get their friends and participate in a scrim, which is really fun. New players are able to of course play casually and try to pick up on the game, as it's easier than ever with official servers. And I think old and new players alike are able to enjoy the skins in the game (just don't open too many crates if you play other games/have other hobbies). All in all, this version of Counter-Strike may NOT be the best in the series. In my opinion, it is because I am used to the changes from Source and 1.6. It's really up for the player to decide whether if they want to play this or not. It's still great, and even better with friends, but if you're still a regular on a server on CS:S or 1.6, you may want to just stay there. However, if you see this game for half-off or even 75% off like in the Winter Sale last year, I highly recommend it. One more thing--- if you don't FPS, I really wouldn't buy this.

review: A much-refined first person shooter which recieves frequent balancing updates. While easier to get into than other competitive games (Such as DOTA 2), the community can still be harsh if you underperform in the competitive mode (Which comes with a decent, but not-yet-perfect ranking system). It features a few game modes appealing to all skill levels, and custom made privately run servers as well as officially run Valve servers. All in all, I have very much enjoyed my time playing the game, and definitely got my money's worth preordering it. As an added bonus, it features a very active community market, where you can sell and buy weapon skins and stickers. If you play your cards right, you can easily make back the money you spent on this game (especially if you buy it during a sale) in steam wallet funds.

review: Currently the best competitive FPS indeed ! It is difficult to take in hand the game at the beginning, but with some practice, you should get the mechanics of the game. The strong point is that VALVe publishes updates regularly but also brings a support for the eSport with "eSport cases", team sticker or event cashprize (ESL One, DreamHack). VALVe is also close to the community and also helps map maker with the Operation/Season Pass like Operation Breakout or Operation Phoenix, so you can play community map in competitive mode ! The weak point imo, is the community, you're a noob, ou you're a cheater. Furthermore, there are many cheater when the game is cheap on Steam, but these low prices are usually followed by many VAC ban... This game does not look like other games as the Call of Duty Saga (this game is for child and noob) and they want to make money, CS:GO is a real competitive game which knows how to evolve and which knows how to listen to his community pro and casual community ! GL & HF ! Thanks VOLVO :D

review: I got this game a while ago from a friend's reccomendation, and I am very pleased. It took away tons of money that I had sitting around, and turned it into digital files called skins. These skins can be put on resumes and businesses count it almost as if you majored in 5 different degrees. All i'm saying is that I do not regret buying this game one bit. Do I regret spending all of the money I did to unbox? Yes.

review: It's tough and unforgiving. It's got a heavy empthasis on teamwork, on taking it slow and steady, and trust me, you'll need to be slow and steady to be successful. Rushing ahead going full ham like you're a Hollywood action hero is going to get you slammed down harder than the bomb at Site B. Regardless, if you can get past the learning curve this game has, you'll have a game with a rather large amount of replay value. The game stays up to date with various updates, and if you feel like sacrificing your money to the elder gods at Valve you can even unbox new finishes and skins for your weapons, in a similar sense to Team Fortress 2. If you do decide to unbox, I hope you like getting jack  from your unboxes. 8.5/10. Would recommend. P.S: Sneaky Beaky Like.

review: Okey i did not play 1.6 or Source (i did play source but only surf and Jail so i don't feel like it counts). So my skill level wasn't that high when i entered the game, and i did not like it at the begining because the steep learning curve, but after i got my first rank (SilverEliteMaster) i was hooked, i stop't playing my main game at the time (Leauge of Legends).Over the course of 6 months i've been playing CSGO for non stop and for good reasons.The game is purely skill based and thats what i liked about it. You could go 1v3 and still win the round if you had the skill. And i'll be honest when CSGO came out (2012) i did not like the game at all because it felt like something was missing, They didn't have the classic Colt with silencer or the Usp. Luckly they added the Colt with silencer (m4a1-s) and the Usp along with Match making. And i do belive this was the reason CSGO became so huge. And this is why i love Valve they listen to the community, they even add skins which are community made on the workshop.

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) Has to one of the best multiplayer shooters i have played it's fun it requires skill and alot of team work to win... even though I always get put in games with Russians... but that's not the point, the point is that THIS IS NOT COD you can't just charge at the enemy and expect to win you have to think of a plan first then if that plan fails it usually ends up with a plan B... or every man for their self. HOWEVER I have 1 major problem with this game... the in' weapon skins... we should not have to play loads more real money just so our guns look cool because we already paid for the damn game surely they could have made some in game money so that we don't waist our money we caould spend on more important things and if they really want to keep their money grabbing ways maybe they should make it so you can also buy the ingame currency as well as earning it because in my honest opinon... this ruined valves reputation for me.. now when i mention the ingame currency most you are most likely thinking "But then everyonne will just buy the same skin as eachother then" so no i didn't mean like you can buy guns seperatly I meant that it's still just cases and keys but with ingame currency instead of my real money... Wow I only wonder how many spelling mistakes there was in that... Oh wells this game gets a 8/10 from me because it's very addictive i just don't like having to pay real money just so I can get nice skins

This is the only game where you spray down the enemy by aiming NOT AT HIM (sniper rifles are the exception)! Of course you have these nasty one-tap-headshots but who cares? All you have to do is to put your crosshair BELOW your enemy and move it left-right and you're be gonna called a god! Sounds good right? There's more - ever wished that using terrain to your advantage could save your life? Now it's possible! A single wooden step can cover you from a grenade lying 0,5 m from you!

review: Good competitive and challenging FPS. It takes heaps of skill, and the game takes a long time to master and get the hang of. I reckon that this is one of the best FPS games on PC at the moment, easily dominating the last few Call of Duty's and Battlefield's. The weapon and sticker collecting in this game is brilliant. The map design is detailed and the develepors cleary tested and thought through everything. This is a good FPS which is pretty underated, and should deserve more attention. (Too bad i cant play most multiplayer games anymore since I moved. The internet here is crap)

review: For me this is one of the greatest FPS games ever made. This game has the magic "sparkle" that makes you play a game hours and hours and hours. The new mechanic to find games to play brings this game to another level and the competetive rank is good to help you fight players that are in the same level of skill as you. Well done Valve!

review: Ok Guys this is T`s VS CT`s terrorist vs counter-terrorist in a many map multiplayer online game. There is 5 vaired game modes, Hostage Mission, Defuse Mission, DeathMacth, Arms Race and Demolition. These game types are all different so you need to spread your self around to find what you want. Added to the game types of Hostage Mission and Defuse Mission there is the option of Casual or Competative, with Casual you vs other players in a fun round of max 8 wins with a great start to learn the game before going onto Competative. In this gamemode you will be pitted agianst 5 enemy`s and you and 4 Allies to see who will become victorious For more info contact me and ill tell you more about the system. This is a great game to play by yourself or with friends i would definatly tell you to try it out !!! If you didnt bother to read that all just buy the game :)

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a near perfect FPS. It has a ton to offer considering it is an MP only game. It is extremely easy to jump from CS 1.6 or CS Source into this game and do just fine. It is also very friendly to people who are new to the Counter-Strike series. Overall I HIGHLY recomended this game.

review: CS:GO: The secret disease. Day 1-4 of CS:GO infection - Infected will be first introduced, and will think the "game" sucks because of the lack of ironsights and difficulty, often quitting. High chance of survival if the infection is ceased and infected seeks treatment. (Girlfriends, outside world). Day 4-7 of CS:GO infection - Infected will slowly be brought into competative matches, and introduced to skins. Infection now spreads at an alarming rate. Day 7-15 of CS:GO infection - Infected will have bought first skins by now - disease is now irriversable. Infection is now at full course. Day 15-18 of CS:GO infection - Infected will ignore outside world to concentrate on "game". CS:GO becoming first priority. There is no cure. Day 20-30 of CS:GO infection. - Infected will be mostly devoid of life, the infected will be a host for the pathogen CS:GO. Skins and AWP "ACE" will be all the infected lives for. The infected will barracide his/herself from sunlight. Day 30+ of CS:GO infection. - Infected can be declared legally dead, CS:GO controls every aspect of it's host's brain and body. Infection controls body completely. Recommended course of action - Destruction of the brain or removal of the head. Contain the disease.

review: In 2002, I played a few games of CS 1.6, which has started and since been remembered as the best FPS i've ever played. (Other than perfect dark, golden eye ETC, thats a different topic.) Then CS:S came along, which I will proudly say today is the best FPS on Steam currently. To counter what others say about it, yeah it has flaws. What game doesn't? Anyways, CS:GO used to be a highly despised game when it came out, and like every game it had issues. I think that most, if not some or all major issues with the game have been ruled out already. Despite a slightly growwing community of hackers in higher ranks, (A problem that ALL and i mean ALL games will have,) which I am not sure can ever be fixxed once it appears. (Kind of like ARMA 2.) I recommend this game not because of a biased opinion, but because it is the only FPS that I can play and actually enjoy it. Sometimes you get matched with people with a lower rank, or don't know the map, but hey, you're that guy sometimes as well. 90/100, That Deagle update.

review: CS:GO Is a fast paced fps that takes skill and strategy (unlike cod where u just spray your heart out and no matter what u do u will hit someone) It takes imense skill to learn how to control your weapon's spray patterns and get those very crucial headshots. CS:GO is the closest anyone has gotten to the perfect fps, hell it could even be the perfect fps, the game is all about self progression and pushing yourself to be better then u were the match before, learn about ur mistakes, control ur gun and most importantly kill the other team! The game isnt about unlocking guns and huge as scopes and all of that crap, it cuts strate to the chase ( you all have the same pool of weapons, they, theres nothing in the game that can give you an advantage exept yourself) CS:GO provides more than just better graphics than its previous versions, it provides a variety of game modes that everyone can have fun in, more guns, and of course more nades. It is also a very balanced game in which there are no cheat guns and if you die it was probably your fault or u just got caught at close range with a sniper, but that said you should be able to kill your opponent at close range with your sniper if your good enough. There are still some things that CS:GO might have to improve on, but these things are things that all fps games suffer from such as campers and hackers, that nothing valve can do will stop them, ussually there are no hackers in your game, it is very rare for u to come by one if u play on official servers because of the vac (valve anti cheat) program. In all CS:GO has fun updates, great gameplay, and gorgeous gun skins haha! If your looking for an fps to buy this is the only choice you really have because of how amazing it is.

This is it. This is what my life calling is. I waited many years to find my purpose in life and this is it. Counter strike will be my permanent career because 12 year olds never grow up and they need a daily thrashing.

review: CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO

review: Competitive is really fun, and I reccomend it. Even though there are in game purchases, it only affects how your gun looks. Really you only need to spend $15 to unlock everything you need to play. The cases in CS:GO are similar of TF2 crates, and the item instead of unusuals is a knife case. Overall, this game will be relevant for a long time (unlike sililar franchises like CoD that make a new game every year) the people playing are usually very friendly, and the community is wonderful. I would reccomend buying and giving it a whirl!

review: this game is great i like it because it has more real life terms unlike call of duty it feels like you doing real mission's in real life this is a 10/10 game for people who like saving people,blowing up stuff and so on also what o found relly cool is that is you can put stickers on your guns makes it for fun killing people with cool looking guns oh btw there are lots of reskins for you guns now the bad things i found that people like to troll alot on this game so lets say you join a competive match and someone just vote kicks you for fun and everyone says yes to it because thay would be funny for you to get kicked and get a cooldown of 7 days witch is not funny and just makes you mad another bad thing is that people like to kill you on spawn and thay use hacks to not get banned i have seen this with my own eyes i was backstabed on spawn and i died and that did not get banned and thay do it over and over again and again and if you try to kick them i does not work but still it does not happin all the time anyway this game is 10/10 it is a GG :D

review: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a very fun and competitive first person shooter. However, it is very much different from the other mainstream games in the industry such as Call of Duty and Battlefield. Mainly so, the aiming and recoil. Unless it is a sniper, AUG, or SG553, there are no sights to aim down of any kind. But to compensate, there is recoil, which is in a predictable and learnable pattern. All in all this is probably my favorite FPS, and by far the most tactical I've ever played. I would not trade any second I've spent playing it. Not to mention that the community is for the most part very mature and mild mannered, although you will run into the occasional "dbag" and "troll" you more often than not will meet very level-headed people who are looking for fun, and competition. 10/10, Fantastic game!

review: I do not have a lot of hours on this game, but from playing CSS and CS 1.6 I can say they have done an outstanding job. I love Counter Strike and will always love the game, people care about graphics pfffft, it is all about gameplay and this game has it. It is 1000x better than COD and all other first person shooter, if you are looking for a game that will bring a lot of fun to you this is the game to get. Once you get into it, you can never stop playing from how fun the game is, best gameplay, best first person shooter and I strongly recommend this game.

review: Counter Strike has come a long way since it was a Half-Life mod in the late 90's and is still just as fun as the first day I played it. If you're looking to purchase an FPS that will outlast any COD or Battlefield game you've ever owned stop here. We've been playing on the same core maps since the beginning and we still come back for more. There's no other FPS experience like it. Valves best title in my opinion.

review: Always getting better. So much to learn and improve on and the skins add a really nice freshness to everything, it's never the same old M4 or the same old AK47 texture the wide range of skins and the 5 different quality levels make every game a little bit fresher. Generally speaking a great community, among the best around normally very helpful and friendly but game for a laugh if it's there to be had. I'm hooked and I know most people will as well if they give it a chance. 210K viewers for the recent finals of EMS one Katowice 2014 finals, the game is only going up so you may as well get into it now.

review: After a while of playing cs:go I can talk about many good things in this game but also a few bad aspects that can kill the fun you could have with this game. I will start with the positive things I can say about cs:go. The Gameplay is great as a source player it felt a bit strange in the beginning, but after a few weeks of playing itss getting way better. The Graphical style is good a bit strange but I dont like the strong movement of the weapons while running. Or the command "cl_ragdoll_physics_enable 0" is cheat protected. But this is more minor. But theres a much bigger Problem the Wintersale was great no question but a price reduced Counter-Strike part is more hurting the game cause these days I had seen many cheaters and a very bad working Anti-Cheat-Solution the VAC isnt bad. And Im not really sure how the "Report a Cheater" System is actually working. But the one that really gets on my nerves is that I hit with tapping much less as one who sprays and duckspam alltime But All in one its a great and well done game with his little edges but most of them arent that bad. By any questions or other things feel frtee to ask me.

review: Me and first person shooters have had a love hate relationship for a very long time, starting out on halo and competing in a few tourneys in it started my descent into it, though after Halo 3's release I felt sort of let down by the genre, attempting to move over to the Call of Duty franchise left me feeling bored with easy gameplay, and constant hands grabbing at my wallet which made me leave FPS in general Then a few months ago I build my first PC looking around during the steam sale for stuff I found the Valve complete pack which had L4D2 and Portal, which I knew and love, aswell as half life which I had yet to try one night when bored I noticed this game in my library and was like, hmmm I wonder what this is I have not returned from that moment, this game has had me so in love, more so then my early days in Halo it is proof for me that graphic fidelity is not the be all end all, the mechanics in this game make it one of the most intense games I have ever played that moment where you start defusing, you hear someone behind you and turn and get that quick lucky headshot, then turn back and start defusing again, as the beeping gets faster and you feel your heart racing hoping that you dont see that green light that marks your demise No matter how many times I have had this moment it has not lost a cent of its love and intensity from me As I said earlier it is not the most visually pleasing, if your looking for over the top visuals, go elsewhere however if you want a well constructed game that runs silky smooth on 90% of machines, and will challenge you to get better. A game where Skill conquers nearly all besides raw luck on rare occasions a game that you dont just pick your favorite gun and keep spawning in with it, where each round your paying to get that gun off of your past performance from the last rounds, and you have to decide, do I just not buy anything or do I get a sub par gun in an attempt to get some real kills CS GO forces you to think smart you cant just walk and spray in a straight line, there is recoil, and there are true tactics here that cater to the well prepared and well coordinated there are also casual modes, which I have little interest in, I play them when I havent played in a few days and want to get myself back in gear before moving back into Competitive I really do enjoy the community market place on here, I have spent way to much on gun skins, but there is absolutely no pressure to buy anything, however I feel its nice to have a gun and name it once in a while and be like "THIS, this is mine" I hope more people get in on this game, especially at this price there is almost no reason not too, I have sold guns on this game for over $60 which then got me a whole bunch of other cheaper gun skins and a game or two this is by far my favorite first person shooter

review: Absolutely love CS:GO! Of all of the Counter-Strike games that have come out since the original, this definitely captures the best aspects of each one of them. There are definitely some little details that make the game-play not as fun; primarily certain physics/logic discrepancies with the environment and the ballistics of the firearms. One of the other downsides to the game is the cost of the in-game purchases for skins. The case drops are fantastic, however the cost of a key for a weapons case being priced at $2.49 seems a bit high. Bottom-line: If you really enjoy team based (and deathmatch) FPS games, you need to get this game!

review: When i bought this game in early 2013 i didnt think it would become into on eof the most biggest eSport games of 2014/2015. At first i wasnt that keen on the game, everything was unbalanced and it was so weird and bad compered to 1.6 and Source, then when Valve decided to put some efort into polishing this game it turned out to be one (if not the best) game that they made. Everyone on Steam needs to have this masterpiece of a game. 10/10

review: Recently got hooked on this game and it is fanastic. Been playing a lot recently. Casual is blatantly not very fun. Arms race can have its moments however. The real fun in the game is found through competitive. You work your way through various skill groups and earn cool weapon camo's that have the potential to go for upwards of $100 USD on the market. Great game, highly recommended.

review: Now that Militia and Assault have returned, I'm feeling much happier about this title. The developers continue to give love to this 2012 update to the old classic, walking the line between introducing new features and maintaining what the professional scene loves about Counter-strike. In my eyes, dump your old CS... this is where it's at. Molotov!

review: I love this game so much. Unlike many other games, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has realistic gun fireing, movement, physics, and many other realistic factors that you can not find in most first person shooters. Aside from the realism, my favorite part of the game is the strategy. This is a team strategy game with two different sides. I like to develop strategies that I can test in the famous Competative Match Making. The Competative MM uses ranks that you develop over time to put you in games with players at your level. Once you join a Competative MM match, you can not leave without a penulty, so you have to be carefull of your time. If you don't have time for a match and you want to play, just join a casual server. The casual servers don't hold you back and have no penulties or anything for losing or leaving. When you first get the game it will be incredibly hard, but if you practice you can get much better. This is one of my favorite games I have! -Cj

review: This is a fantastic game. The matchmaker will try to place you in a game with players of your skill level, so a new player will not be up against people who play a lot and are very good. The gunplay feels very much like a counter strike game and I'm glad that this new spin as been added to the series.

review: I was in a 1v5 situtation and we were the CT's. I headshot a guy with my m4a4 and then went over to his body and picked up his AK47. I then went down a staircase to find a guy staring down at me. I shot him down quickly whilst also seeing another guy coming. I backed off and let him rush out, then killed him. By then, the bomb had been planted. I went to A bombsite and saw an AWPer so I killed him before he could 1 shot me. The last guy was camping next to the bomb with a P90, so I picked up the guy's AWP and saw a small bit of his head peeking out. Bam. He's dead. I quickly ran with my knife to the bomb and defused it...well most of it anyway. We lost because I was a second too late and the bomb exploded. 11/10 would play again

review: Before playing CS:GO - " Who tf would pay $300 for a virtual knife " After playing CS:GO - " I'm gonna spend my Christmas money on a knife! " On a more serious note, I really liked the game and have invested many hours into it ( 38 hrs in the past 2 weeks and I can only play on weekends, including Fridays, so basically I've spent about a third of my weekend, if the math adds up, this past 2 weeks on CS:GO ). I find it really fun to play, I'd just say if its you're very first time palying CS:GO on PC, don't head straight into competitive. I played CS:GO on the XBOX since it was released and was decent at it so I thought it would also apply to PC, but I wasn't accustomed to the mouse and keyboard, and lost a bunch of games in competitive and after my 10 wins I got placed in silver. However, I am getting the hang of it now, and am pretty much top-fragging everygame, just got promoted recently, and pretty much I'm aiming to climb to nova during winter break. Past experiences with this series. As said before I've played it CS:GO on the XBOX. I've also played the original CS and CS:CZ, but I've never touched source before. I'd make a comparison but I was really young when I played this so it wouldn't be very accurate. Community-wise, I haven't ran into many toxic players. Most people are willing to communicate and are pretty nice. This game does have its share of "12 year olds" and people who like to constantly talk to the fact that you can't concentrate, but that is very small, I rarely meet any of these "bad" people. I'd also say that from my point of view, the game is pretty balanced between the 2 sides, I mean sure the T AK is 1 hit headshot ( oh yeah aim for headshots, ight be hard at first but you'll quickly get the hang of it ) while, the CT M4 is 2, you've got to remember that CT's are usually the ones defending, you actually have to get that headshot, you can always pick up an AK from a dead T and you switch sides at 15 rounds, and unless you're 0:15 it should even out. tl;dr My overall rating of the game 10/10, really enjoyed palying it and will continue to do so

review: CS has always been known as the best competitive tactic fps and this latest chapter isn't different. It isn't famous as other titles which, every year, hit the market, it hasn't the best graphics nor a movie-like story mode, but it's a game only based on pure skill, and that's the only thing that matters. Forget hours playing to unlock scopes and such things, or people killing you cause of better weapons due to their higher rank. In CSGO everyone has the same possibilities (always!), no matter the rank, no matter the amount of hours played, no matter how much money you spent on it. But, in the beginning, you will need time (a lot of time) to fully understand and then improve aim, tactics, economy and teamplay. Give it time to learn, be patient and it will become the only game you'll want to play. If you are a fps enthusiast this is THE must have game!

review: It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

review: Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.
