It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.	936.2
Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.	2837.1

This game is: 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain 100% reason to purchase this game	180.8
In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in. When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money. Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend. In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a "Hostage Rescue Kit", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.	19.7
Pros: - Chickens Cons: - Not enough chickens	589.8
I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia. I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus. I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind. My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze. I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia. Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning. My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished. Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn. The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room. _ Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people. Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway. Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before. I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value. I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came. The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow. My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade. I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head. I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.728mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words "NOT ON MY WATCH" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks. Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed. A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen. Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long- wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk. _ Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice. I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG; 9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself "I ing hate that gun" while typing out "#TAZED " in all chat. Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. "get rekt" "u suck" "TIME to die, amirite" Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round. From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will. The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes. Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a "REKT" holographic sticker and renamed "Clockwork Assing". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it. Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never. Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet. Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to  with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you. I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall. I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia.	2309.4
Playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is like masturbating. Feels good doing it but later you regret it. And then you keep on doing it.	350.8
I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.	797.5

CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.	1646.0

I came to this game for my fetish of chickens. When playing the game, I realised that not every map has chickens on it, so I slowly got angrier with the game... The lack of chickens boiled my blood. CSGO made me angry, Until, I found my dream love, Deathmatch. A Chicken on any map, right then.. I'd kick the bots, and chase the chickens around for hours. Ah, It was so pleasurable, How I would do it for hours on end. The chickens are perfect. I play this game for hours on end, and the chickens never disapointment me now, Oh Chickens, how you are my one true love. I can't focus at school anymore.. I only think about chickens, on the way home from school there is a KFC, I walk past it every day, I think of chickens, One time, I literally stopped, and took a fap to one of the chickens. Ah, It was so good. Chickens I love them Oh Chickens THANK YOU GABEN 5/5 I love chickens.	2143.4

This game has been planned perfectly. Gabe's plan has worked perfectly. I have unboxed around 2,400 cases so far and gotten 8 knives. I have spent around $13,000 on this game so far and still play like . I have played over 200 competitive matches and am still a Silver. Every matchmaking team I get is a team of Russians who like saying "" and have a grudge against Obama and have a microphone that sounds like a cat trying to gargle shards of glass. I will keep on unboxing cases, playing like a handicapped person, stay on Silver and keep buying expensive skins that apparently are supposed to make me better but don't. Because after all, Gabe is love, Gabe is life.	489.9

When I was young, tragedy struck my neighborhood when a bomb went off in a local park. I lost my dear uncle in that accident. Along with my pet cat, two hamsters, one very courageous gold fish, my tickle-me elmo doll, and all of my foil Yu-Gi-Oh cards. It was the first time I experienced tragedy and despair, feelings that cut so deep I vowed to exact revenge upon whoever did this. I trained every day, running 25 miles a week, lifting weights in 15 pound increments, taking protein supplements as well as spending the majority of my weekends at the firing range. I enlisted in the military, only to be turned down because I was "only a kid." Then, I discovered Counter-Strike;Global Offensive. A perfect simulation of the events I wanted to prevent and take action upon, I was hooked immediately. I threw away my running sneakers for wool socks and sweatpants, as well as a swiveling chair. I put down my weights and protein supplements for Taco Bell and Instant Noodles. I stopped visiting the fire range and instead purchased a Razer gaming mouse. Worth. My uncle's still dead though.	463.5
Must buy if you love FPS games! This game is all about personal progression, since it comes with a high learning curve, it's not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun. It's about you, that has to learn. The game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, Match Making is great when you are playing with friends. The real game for people that love to play competitively, with a team or just solo. There are also casual game modes available for the people that don't like to play competitively, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, Hostage and Defusual missions which can be played on casual style, or mostly known as public or community servers. These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play.	2493.5
Match Making.  Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level.  Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments.  The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard.  Most old maps from CS, are in the game.  No perks and other unnecessary clutter.  Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch!  No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic.	422.4

I don't know what to say about this game, so here is a recipe for pancakes, Ingredients: 4tbsp plain flour (about 100g) 1 large free range egg  pint semi-skimmed milk + water (about 300ml -  milk  water) Pinch of salt Butter for frying How to make pancakes: Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture. Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix. In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter. Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps. Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth! Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt. Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later. Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over). Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!	710.2

Counter Strike: Global Offensive, the remake of the classic CS games and not to our surprise, the devs did a good job. One of the lovely things about it, that of had not been kept I seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently, it keeps the mechanics from the classic CS and CS:S and adds a few of it's own, that the original CS and CS:S games could have done with. CSs weak point was always the graphics, the original games were based of the HL1 engine, which I am sure all you are aware is reasonably old, although its added a new range of updated maps, including two operations. The most recent being Operation Bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as DLC. And once again, Valve have decided to take the generous approach to this, an example is that if the lobby leader has the Operation Bravo pass, and no one else does, everyone can play Op. Bravo, good job Valve, you did it again. What was missing/wrong with this game has been fixed by Valve, which is fantastic. Items have been added, you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature, although many think it's turning into TF2, which is a valid point, but Valve need there money, if you take a look at the price of the game, its not exactly the same as COD (ew) which has a hefty price tag of 40 ($60 I think) and CSGO managed to do fine at 12, which I think is $15 in the US. Sadly I did not play the original CS, I have however obviously seen gameplay, and watched friends play it. I have played a small amount of CS:S and compared it to CSGO, which was considerably easy, some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games have/had have been completely eradicated from CSGO which is brilliant. Such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games, such as the saving mechanic. In CS if you die, you lose all your weapons, they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup, players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies, so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around, the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this, and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion, it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and youre still alive you simply gain $0. The CSGO match making system is an exceptional feature, the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against, and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other. Matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank. Here are all the current ranks available in game.	702.9
Many people seem to think that this is like COD, you simply rank up from playing the game, no this is not true. You rank up as your skill improved, if you play well for a few weeks, and you finally get the Gold Nova youve been wanting for ages, and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly, its for the best, you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level. Recently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game, this is in now way ground breaking its been done by other games before, but they have there issues, although I have not got round to actually trying out this feature I have been told that it appears to be working considerably well. The watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful AWP shot, or got that 5-kill ace. I would like to say in this final paragraph, of the 250 hours+ I have played of this game I have seriously enjoyed (almost) every moment of it, sure there are some hackers, but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with. All the factors about this game are good, but as all games go by, they have there problems, sure if CSGO has improved graphics that would be nice, and if *breathes in heavily* VALVE WOULD ADD 128 TICK MATCH MAKING SERVERS this has caused some annoyance for me in match making, if you dont understand whats so bad about 64 tick, I suggest you watch this video:	1106.9
Anyway, I highly suggest you buy this game, apart from my small rant at the end, and game is fine, good game mechanics, graphics are sort of good, I supposed most of the maps are well balanced, there are a few that I suggest you shouldnt play though. The game has a small price tag, which I am sure will attract you to it even more, especially when its on sale at 75% of! Hope you enjoyed reading my game review of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not.	666.1
Once upon a time on de_inferno there existed a single chicken on A site. "I must get to my family!" said the father chicken. Navagating through all the stained karambits and battle-scarred asiimovs will prove quite the challenge. As the chicken creeps up the stairs into apartments he sees the glass shatter in the first room to his right. He scatters down the hallway anxious of what will happen next. There are 3 mysterious people wearing potato sacks on their head and must have applied way too much eye shadow. He sneaks past them and makes it into the crawlspace. "I can't believe it! I may actually live to see my family on B site fishing in the koi pond." AWP shots are being exchanged down the middle of the battlefield and the chicken hears flowerpots shattering here and there. As he gets to the exit of crawlspace he sees another potatosack creature hiding behinds a haystack and scuttles down into banana. "Who the hell drove a taxi down here?" says the chicken. He makes it down the dark ally and glances over to see the remains of his family. They are but feathers floating in the burnt sushi in the pond after a thrown molotov. "I.. I.... I can't belive thi-BOOM-." A cheeky CT sits in his spawn with an AWP as he giggles in his chair after murdering the poor creature in cold blood. Please, I beg of you, these chickens are endangered creatures and risk thier lives to venture through the city just to meet thier family again..	544.0

Last Update Goodbye, CS:GO. You really helped me a lot on English : ) and buried me with "Silver II, the Nu:B" on my tombstone. -------------------------------------------- Update 17/02/2015 Hey my foreign friends. Have fun in the Chinese Lunar new year! May the goat or sheep bless you and have a safe and sound 2015. Update 1/31/2015 400 hours and I'm still Silver 2. ------------------------------------------- Last Update before Christmas: Kids are lovely. "Carry us harder," he screamed. However, I'm just a lucky silver 2 with swag-7 and pro90. I tried my best to give him the Christmas present, but I failed. So sad. ------------------------------------------ Update something about racism. Well....as an Asian, I encountered lots of racism assaults during the gameplay. I would just simply mute the racist and report him after the match, cuz I play this game for fun and practicing English, not arguing with other players... Fortunately, most people are friendly and are willing to learn new things about Asia. Don't regard all the jokes as racism. I also made some friends online, people from East Europe, State people and Canadians. Hope the world can develop in peace and go hell terrorism! Yes, that refers to you, ISIS. Go hell. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prefer it to Rising Storm, because it has a crosshair. Prefer it to Tomb Raider, because I don't have to aim by holding R-mouse. Prefer it to Call of Duty, because I would know how I died. Playing CS:GO is a good way to practice English. Not suitable for foreign youngsters, because I learned lots of four letter word from this game.	484.7

I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons. Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun. Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more? CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience. If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades. Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.) EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins. ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches. Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers. At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches. @Shadowdance You're welcome. You gave me the push to write this reply. Cheers fellow comrades.	1177.4

I didn't know what to write about in my review, so here's a recipe on how to play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive instead: 1 Overpriced branded gaming mouse (best results with Razer) 1 Overpriced branded gaming keyboard (best results with Razer) 1 Giant mouse pad 50cm+ (because who the  uses the imperial system) 1 144hz monitor (note: anything lower than 144hz will NOT work) 1 1/4 cups milk 1 Prebuilt Gaming computer (preferably one with a overpowered cpu and a  gpu *cough* ayy lmaolienware *cough* 3 cans of phresh memes Steps: 1. Set your screen ratio to 4:3 and to the lowest resolution possible so you can play like a pro 2. Buy a P90 and spam the keys A and D when shooting at someone 3. Reach Gold Nova 1 to make fun of silvers 5. Call everyone who is less skilled than you a filthy casual and a silver 6. Tell everyone who is more skilled than you to stop toggling and to go on a VACation 7. Steal your mum/dad's wallet and buy a knife and say you unboxed it. Optional University/College funds 8. Give up and go play on some Surf/Zombie servers 9. Realise there is no Step 4	786.3
At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses. The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer. The game is simply tactful; its brilliant when youre alive and even when youre dead the game is still fun to watch other players. Global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have created You will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself. This game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself.	2632.4
If you don't want to be bullied by everyone in competitive: 1. Mute your mic. 2. Get rid of your profile picture. 3. Blend your computer piece by piece. 4. Scrape up the ashes into a little box, 5. Dig a grave (6 ft. minimum) 6. Throw the box into the grave. 7. Fill the hole with cement and concrete. 8. RUN.	411.5

I only got this game because everyone literally forced me to get it, so I got it, I played it. It was good in the beginning, until I started playing competitive, and why is that? Well as I walked into my first competitive match, I got into a match with 4 Russians on my team, and enemy team consisted of 3 Russians and 2 Americans that only spoke Russian. When the game started I walked 4 steps towards mid and got instantly sniped through doors, and that was a teammate! My team lost half their players before we met the enemy...So after that game I came to the conclusion that all the Russians wanted was to  my blyat. Pros: +Great maps, especially when they're filled with Russians! +I got A+ in Russian after owning this game for a week. +I can now insult my friends in Russian because they don't understand ! +I finally fit it(This review is more about my life than the actual game) Cons: -Russians, duh -Russians with guns! -democracy!!! -Screaming Russians -Not enough Russians I wonder how many dislikes I can get by saying this?	292.6
Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No *t perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes. If you want to win in Counter-Strike, you have to learn the maps, play smart, and have fast reflexes. Since you work for each and every kill, it's much more satisfying than other current gen shooters.	56.7

The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? "Oh im just smurfing.." You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being "smurfing" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have	3257.6
It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY.	1471.8
Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.	348.1

is a pretty great game. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- First things first, the basic rules. In	230.1
, you have the choice to play five official gamemodes: -Arms Race -Deathmatch -Demolition -Casual -Competitive -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Summary of gamemodes: In Arms Race, the player gets weapons not by the money, but by killing people. Each two kills get you a new weapon. At the final stage of the weapon, you will get the Gold Knife. Kill someone with it, and you win. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Deathmatch, yes. In Deathmatch, it is like a "warm-up" or "practice" mode. For me, at least. In this gamemode, you join a server, and you just kill everybody you see, except your teammates. You can get weapons for free. There are also random occasions in which the game will tell you that a weapon currently has bonus points, and if you want to use that particular weapon, you press g by default. The person who gets the most points, wins. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So next in the list, is Demolition. It is set to be a 5 vs 5 match. It also has 20 rounds. The first team to get 11 rounds wins, and it can even finish with a tie. In the first half, you play as a set team. In the second, you play as the other team. You cannot buy any weapons, but instead, you get weapons by killing people, just like in Arms Race. Money is also not rewarded. But this is different: let's make a scenario. In (Round 1), you kill an enemy. the weapon will be rewarded to you on the next round. But what if you kill two in one round? You still get to advance to the next weapon, but you get a bonus grenade. For example: 2 kills: next wep + bonus grenade 3 kills: next wep + 2 bonus grenades Get the pattern? Yeah. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- What next? Oh, yeah. It's Casual. Casual is a 10vs10 game, with 15 rounds. The first team to get 8 wins, wins the match. It is split into two sub-gamemodes: Bomb Defusal (IIRC), and Hostage. Sorry, I don't know the exact names. In Bomb Defusal, there are two bomb sites. A and B. The Counter-Terrorists always have the Defusal Kit equipped, even if they didn't buy it. The kit shortens the defusal time from 10 to 5 seconds. The terrorists can freely choose which site they want to plant in. The bomb, iirc, has a 45 second timer. When defusing / planting the bomb, it makes a noise. Of course, the CTs are trying to stop them. Counter-Terrorists can win in two ways: killing all of the Ts before they plant the bomb, or defusing the bomb. For the terrorists, it's the same: killing all of the CTs, or making the bomb explode. So in Hostage, the roles are switched: the terrorists are now the defending side, and vice-versa. As the gamemode says, the Ts are holding some people hostage. And it is up to the CTs to get the hostages, or kill all of the Ts. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Finally, competitive. The competitive gamemode is much like the Casual gamemode, except a few differences: - Each kill has 2x more money reward than in Casual. - Defusal Kits / Rescue Kits cost money, and they don't get equipped automatically for free. - It's a 5v5. - Competitive has 30 rounds. - Each half has 15 rounds, and in both halves, you get to play as CTs and Ts. - Like the Demolition Gamemode, the match can end in a tie. - People are much more serious. -  blyat -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So, here is my thoughts. CS:GO offers a large variety of gamemodes, and you can just see that I've written about all of them. Phew, that took a lot of time. Anyway, CS:GO is a very entertaining game, and each match has a different experience. Yes, CS:GO can be a bit too serious, but it is also a fun game. The community is not just a single person, you know. There are people who don't like you, and some don't care, but some will make your day better. GO is a game with a high skill ceiling. There is a huge learning curve to go in this game. It's like chess. Easy to learn, hard to master. I've met a huge amount of my friends in CS:GO, and I still talk to them. Some, I don't. Yeah. They'll be grumpy at times, but they inspire me. There are some bugs in this game, but not too gamebreaking. Just a few small ones. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you have  internet. Ping matters. I hope you know that CS:GO is available for consoles, too. In fact, VALVe talked about having cross-platform multiplayer, but that would be unfair for the console players, cause they have a delay in controls. I am 100% sure that VALVe completely abandoned Global Offensive in the console. The competitive scene is pretty huge, too. And a tournament even reached more than a million viewers! Online and in the tournament itself. It's only two years old, and it's already a big game. VALVe may not be the most listening, but they try. Except sometimes they make some aspects of the game turn to . Like the AWP. They reduced the movement speed while scoping. There are also skins in CS:GO. Some care about it, some don't. Just a matter of personal preference. I think they're part of why this game is popular. The most negative opinion I have, though, is about the Competitive gamemode. Sure, "no game is perfect", and the real fun is there, yeah, but the banning system needs some stuff to be taken care of. You know, just a few tweaks, like forgiving a person if he accidentally kills someone. It is pretty unforgiving. For who doesn't know, you can get banned for killing a teammate too many times, or leaving the game. If someone abandons your team, you can surrender. Not permanent bans, though. The VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) System also needs some fixing to be done. Some cheats aren't fully detected, so the hacker doesn't get VACed. From my experiences, I still haven't encountered a hacker, but that's probably because I'm a Silver. Some people can be real s. So that's my review. Hoped you like it! EDIT: I missed a few points, thanks > SKaREO About the netcode of CS:GO, truth be told, it HAS been really bad... for a few weeks now in fact. I go up to a guy and spray him, but most of the time it registers 2 or 3 hits out of 8 for example which could be lethal. Take note, that's in close quarters. No, that's not horrible aim. In the words of a truly horrible player, "omfg 64-tick sucks volvo pls 128-tick". Eh, doesn't really suck, just... well, mixed? In Global Offensive, there are a few advantages. Some on the T side, and some on the CT side. Hm, what's it called? Yeah, the perspective. Take this for an example, the "left shoulder advantage". |	731.4
| Here's an explanation: the player models hold guns on the right side. Therefore holding angles or peeking with left shoulder is more favorable as your model is less exposed. TheWarOwl has this video to make advantage of your perspective: |	1328.2
| And that's well-- unfair. Just like in real life, should I see your eyes, you will see mine, too. As I said earlier, VAC needs some fixing. It's terrible. And again, I still haven't played with any cheaters, so I can't fully review this part yet. Thanks.	1184.7

. I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example. 9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous	410.9

You will chase chickens for the whole match. You will get kicked. You will get dominated by the same person for the whole match. You will be on the losing team most rounds.

The "third" game in the critically acclaimed First Person Shooter series that have shaped the PC gaming industry for years. Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve. I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better. Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc. Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic "Gun Game" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic "plant the bomb"-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators. Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well.	1713.2

I haven't played much to be able to fully review it, sadly... However, from what I've played, I think the story's about a bunch of high-school students with sunglasses wanting to blow up a courtyard in a desert while the government spends billions of dollars funding the police with all the Karambits and AWP | BOOM 's they want in order to "take'em down, easy peezy lemon squeezy" (direct quote from an interview I did...). I think it's all because of some sort of rivalry due to an anual chicken chasing contest...	222.4

Let's put aside bad low rank community and concentrate on some real things! Gameplay 9/10 The gameplay itself is very good, every in-game control is easily adjustable, you can even change the crosshair. Crosshairs can be dots, squares and even triangles which is something that can really help you improve your skills and your gameplay experience. Graphics 8/10 As with in-game controls, it's same with graphics, there's many options which will help you utilize your settings. The game optimization is done pretty well, which is expected from Valve. The only problem is that there's a lot of pixel walking which we have seen even on the professional scene. Sound and voice acting 9/10 They have done it right, with quality headphones you can hear every opponents action, and take advantage of that. Voicing is beautiful, they vary from every character, they are with different accents and sometimes bad pronunciation , but that's something that makes it more realistic. My favorite voice impression is "I'm throwing smok". Game physics 7/10 Although it's a lot better from what we saw in "Counter-Strike: Source" and in "Counter-Strike" there's still some problems which might ruin your experience. Weapon recoil is done pretty well and they are similar to real recoils of those weapons, which is something that we don't see in every FPS game. Community 5/10 Yeah, yeah, I know, community isn't the best, but it really depends on your rank. As previously shown, lower rank equals to more trolls, harassers and leavers, but isn't it like that in every online game? When you are a higher rank you can still encounter toxic players, but they aren't a problem anymore, the real problem turn to be hackers . Valve is taking care of them pretty fast, but it seems like it's not fast enough. Overall experience 10/10 It has some problems, but I enjoyed and I'm still enjoying in this game. Everyone should at least try this game.	600.8

What is CSGO? CSGO is an ocean, the further down you go in rank the more you drown in speds and scrubs. Eventually you go past the point of no return and you simply cannot return to the surface, forced to suffocate beneath the waves being dragged down by anchors and asphyxiate from the high pitched shrieks of " Rego on this server".	2015.8
I want to like this game. I really do. But there's just a few quirks I can't get past. (Nothing about gameplay or anything like that). For whatever reason, I dont feel like coming home and playing CS:GO for hours as I do with other games. Also the community is really mean to new players for some odd reason. My first competetive game, I had people calling me a  just because wasn't going to the right place. When I'm the last alive and I lose a gunfight, I get kicked for nothing in particular. And when I'm playing with my friends and I don't understand how I haven't hit the person, my friends tell me,	63.7

The problem is, how do you learn how to play when nobody is nice enough to help you out? P.S. There are occasionally the nice ones in a lobby, but they are NOT the majority.
