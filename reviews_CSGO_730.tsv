It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.	936.2
Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.	2837.1

This game is: 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain 100% reason to purchase this game	180.8
In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in. When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money. Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend. In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a "Hostage Rescue Kit", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.	19.7
Pros: - Chickens Cons: - Not enough chickens	589.8
I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia. I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus. I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind. My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze. I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia. Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning. My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished. Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn. The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room. _ Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people. Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway. Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before. I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value. I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came. The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow. My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade. I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head. I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.728mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words "NOT ON MY WATCH" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks. Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed. A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen. Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long- wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk. _ Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice. I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG; 9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself "I ing hate that gun" while typing out "#TAZED " in all chat. Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. "get rekt" "u suck" "TIME to die, amirite" Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round. From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will. The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes. Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a "REKT" holographic sticker and renamed "Clockwork Assing". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it. Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never. Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet. Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to  with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you. I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall. I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn. Another night of Insomnia.	2309.4
Playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is like masturbating. Feels good doing it but later you regret it. And then you keep on doing it.	350.8
I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.	797.5

CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators. The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis. Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever. There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.	1646.0

I came to this game for my fetish of chickens. When playing the game, I realised that not every map has chickens on it, so I slowly got angrier with the game... The lack of chickens boiled my blood. CSGO made me angry, Until, I found my dream love, Deathmatch. A Chicken on any map, right then.. I'd kick the bots, and chase the chickens around for hours. Ah, It was so pleasurable, How I would do it for hours on end. The chickens are perfect. I play this game for hours on end, and the chickens never disapointment me now, Oh Chickens, how you are my one true love. I can't focus at school anymore.. I only think about chickens, on the way home from school there is a KFC, I walk past it every day, I think of chickens, One time, I literally stopped, and took a fap to one of the chickens. Ah, It was so good. Chickens I love them Oh Chickens THANK YOU GABEN 5/5 I love chickens.	2143.4

This game has been planned perfectly. Gabe's plan has worked perfectly. I have unboxed around 2,400 cases so far and gotten 8 knives. I have spent around $13,000 on this game so far and still play like . I have played over 200 competitive matches and am still a Silver. Every matchmaking team I get is a team of Russians who like saying "" and have a grudge against Obama and have a microphone that sounds like a cat trying to gargle shards of glass. I will keep on unboxing cases, playing like a handicapped person, stay on Silver and keep buying expensive skins that apparently are supposed to make me better but don't. Because after all, Gabe is love, Gabe is life.	489.9

When I was young, tragedy struck my neighborhood when a bomb went off in a local park. I lost my dear uncle in that accident. Along with my pet cat, two hamsters, one very courageous gold fish, my tickle-me elmo doll, and all of my foil Yu-Gi-Oh cards. It was the first time I experienced tragedy and despair, feelings that cut so deep I vowed to exact revenge upon whoever did this. I trained every day, running 25 miles a week, lifting weights in 15 pound increments, taking protein supplements as well as spending the majority of my weekends at the firing range. I enlisted in the military, only to be turned down because I was "only a kid." Then, I discovered Counter-Strike;Global Offensive. A perfect simulation of the events I wanted to prevent and take action upon, I was hooked immediately. I threw away my running sneakers for wool socks and sweatpants, as well as a swiveling chair. I put down my weights and protein supplements for Taco Bell and Instant Noodles. I stopped visiting the fire range and instead purchased a Razer gaming mouse. Worth. My uncle's still dead though.	463.5
Must buy if you love FPS games! This game is all about personal progression, since it comes with a high learning curve, it's not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun. It's about you, that has to learn. The game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, Match Making is great when you are playing with friends. The real game for people that love to play competitively, with a team or just solo. There are also casual game modes available for the people that don't like to play competitively, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, Hostage and Defusual missions which can be played on casual style, or mostly known as public or community servers. These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play.	2493.5
Match Making.  Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level.  Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments.  The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard.  Most old maps from CS, are in the game.  No perks and other unnecessary clutter.  Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch!  No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic.	422.4

I don't know what to say about this game, so here is a recipe for pancakes, Ingredients: 4tbsp plain flour (about 100g) 1 large free range egg  pint semi-skimmed milk + water (about 300ml -  milk  water) Pinch of salt Butter for frying How to make pancakes: Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture. Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix. In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter. Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps. Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth! Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat. Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt. Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later. Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over). Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!	710.2

Counter Strike: Global Offensive, the remake of the classic CS games and not to our surprise, the devs did a good job. One of the lovely things about it, that of had not been kept I seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently, it keeps the mechanics from the classic CS and CS:S and adds a few of it's own, that the original CS and CS:S games could have done with. CSs weak point was always the graphics, the original games were based of the HL1 engine, which I am sure all you are aware is reasonably old, although its added a new range of updated maps, including two operations. The most recent being Operation Bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as DLC. And once again, Valve have decided to take the generous approach to this, an example is that if the lobby leader has the Operation Bravo pass, and no one else does, everyone can play Op. Bravo, good job Valve, you did it again. What was missing/wrong with this game has been fixed by Valve, which is fantastic. Items have been added, you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature, although many think it's turning into TF2, which is a valid point, but Valve need there money, if you take a look at the price of the game, its not exactly the same as COD (ew) which has a hefty price tag of 40 ($60 I think) and CSGO managed to do fine at 12, which I think is $15 in the US. Sadly I did not play the original CS, I have however obviously seen gameplay, and watched friends play it. I have played a small amount of CS:S and compared it to CSGO, which was considerably easy, some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games have/had have been completely eradicated from CSGO which is brilliant. Such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games, such as the saving mechanic. In CS if you die, you lose all your weapons, they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup, players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies, so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around, the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this, and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion, it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and youre still alive you simply gain $0. The CSGO match making system is an exceptional feature, the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against, and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other. Matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank. Here are all the current ranks available in game.	702.9
Many people seem to think that this is like COD, you simply rank up from playing the game, no this is not true. You rank up as your skill improved, if you play well for a few weeks, and you finally get the Gold Nova youve been wanting for ages, and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly, its for the best, you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level. Recently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game, this is in now way ground breaking its been done by other games before, but they have there issues, although I have not got round to actually trying out this feature I have been told that it appears to be working considerably well. The watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful AWP shot, or got that 5-kill ace. I would like to say in this final paragraph, of the 250 hours+ I have played of this game I have seriously enjoyed (almost) every moment of it, sure there are some hackers, but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with. All the factors about this game are good, but as all games go by, they have there problems, sure if CSGO has improved graphics that would be nice, and if *breathes in heavily* VALVE WOULD ADD 128 TICK MATCH MAKING SERVERS this has caused some annoyance for me in match making, if you dont understand whats so bad about 64 tick, I suggest you watch this video:	1106.9
Anyway, I highly suggest you buy this game, apart from my small rant at the end, and game is fine, good game mechanics, graphics are sort of good, I supposed most of the maps are well balanced, there are a few that I suggest you shouldnt play though. The game has a small price tag, which I am sure will attract you to it even more, especially when its on sale at 75% of! Hope you enjoyed reading my game review of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not.	666.1
Once upon a time on de_inferno there existed a single chicken on A site. "I must get to my family!" said the father chicken. Navagating through all the stained karambits and battle-scarred asiimovs will prove quite the challenge. As the chicken creeps up the stairs into apartments he sees the glass shatter in the first room to his right. He scatters down the hallway anxious of what will happen next. There are 3 mysterious people wearing potato sacks on their head and must have applied way too much eye shadow. He sneaks past them and makes it into the crawlspace. "I can't believe it! I may actually live to see my family on B site fishing in the koi pond." AWP shots are being exchanged down the middle of the battlefield and the chicken hears flowerpots shattering here and there. As he gets to the exit of crawlspace he sees another potatosack creature hiding behinds a haystack and scuttles down into banana. "Who the hell drove a taxi down here?" says the chicken. He makes it down the dark ally and glances over to see the remains of his family. They are but feathers floating in the burnt sushi in the pond after a thrown molotov. "I.. I.... I can't belive thi-BOOM-." A cheeky CT sits in his spawn with an AWP as he giggles in his chair after murdering the poor creature in cold blood. Please, I beg of you, these chickens are endangered creatures and risk thier lives to venture through the city just to meet thier family again..	544.0

Last Update Goodbye, CS:GO. You really helped me a lot on English : ) and buried me with "Silver II, the Nu:B" on my tombstone. -------------------------------------------- Update 17/02/2015 Hey my foreign friends. Have fun in the Chinese Lunar new year! May the goat or sheep bless you and have a safe and sound 2015. Update 1/31/2015 400 hours and I'm still Silver 2. ------------------------------------------- Last Update before Christmas: Kids are lovely. "Carry us harder," he screamed. However, I'm just a lucky silver 2 with swag-7 and pro90. I tried my best to give him the Christmas present, but I failed. So sad. ------------------------------------------ Update something about racism. Well....as an Asian, I encountered lots of racism assaults during the gameplay. I would just simply mute the racist and report him after the match, cuz I play this game for fun and practicing English, not arguing with other players... Fortunately, most people are friendly and are willing to learn new things about Asia. Don't regard all the jokes as racism. I also made some friends online, people from East Europe, State people and Canadians. Hope the world can develop in peace and go hell terrorism! Yes, that refers to you, ISIS. Go hell. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prefer it to Rising Storm, because it has a crosshair. Prefer it to Tomb Raider, because I don't have to aim by holding R-mouse. Prefer it to Call of Duty, because I would know how I died. Playing CS:GO is a good way to practice English. Not suitable for foreign youngsters, because I learned lots of four letter word from this game.	484.7

I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons. Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun. Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more? CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience. If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades. Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.) EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins. ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches. Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers. At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches. @Shadowdance You're welcome. You gave me the push to write this reply. Cheers fellow comrades.	1177.4

I didn't know what to write about in my review, so here's a recipe on how to play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive instead: 1 Overpriced branded gaming mouse (best results with Razer) 1 Overpriced branded gaming keyboard (best results with Razer) 1 Giant mouse pad 50cm+ (because who the  uses the imperial system) 1 144hz monitor (note: anything lower than 144hz will NOT work) 1 1/4 cups milk 1 Prebuilt Gaming computer (preferably one with a overpowered cpu and a  gpu *cough* ayy lmaolienware *cough* 3 cans of phresh memes Steps: 1. Set your screen ratio to 4:3 and to the lowest resolution possible so you can play like a pro 2. Buy a P90 and spam the keys A and D when shooting at someone 3. Reach Gold Nova 1 to make fun of silvers 5. Call everyone who is less skilled than you a filthy casual and a silver 6. Tell everyone who is more skilled than you to stop toggling and to go on a VACation 7. Steal your mum/dad's wallet and buy a knife and say you unboxed it. Optional University/College funds 8. Give up and go play on some Surf/Zombie servers 9. Realise there is no Step 4	786.3
At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses. The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer. The game is simply tactful; its brilliant when youre alive and even when youre dead the game is still fun to watch other players. Global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have created You will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself. This game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself.	2632.4
If you don't want to be bullied by everyone in competitive: 1. Mute your mic. 2. Get rid of your profile picture. 3. Blend your computer piece by piece. 4. Scrape up the ashes into a little box, 5. Dig a grave (6 ft. minimum) 6. Throw the box into the grave. 7. Fill the hole with cement and concrete. 8. RUN.	411.5

I only got this game because everyone literally forced me to get it, so I got it, I played it. It was good in the beginning, until I started playing competitive, and why is that? Well as I walked into my first competitive match, I got into a match with 4 Russians on my team, and enemy team consisted of 3 Russians and 2 Americans that only spoke Russian. When the game started I walked 4 steps towards mid and got instantly sniped through doors, and that was a teammate! My team lost half their players before we met the enemy...So after that game I came to the conclusion that all the Russians wanted was to  my blyat. Pros: +Great maps, especially when they're filled with Russians! +I got A+ in Russian after owning this game for a week. +I can now insult my friends in Russian because they don't understand ! +I finally fit it(This review is more about my life than the actual game) Cons: -Russians, duh -Russians with guns! -democracy!!! -Screaming Russians -Not enough Russians I wonder how many dislikes I can get by saying this?	292.6
Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No *t perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes. If you want to win in Counter-Strike, you have to learn the maps, play smart, and have fast reflexes. Since you work for each and every kill, it's much more satisfying than other current gen shooters.	56.7

The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? "Oh im just smurfing.." You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being "smurfing" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have	3257.6
It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY.	1471.8
Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.	348.1

is a pretty great game. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- First things first, the basic rules. In	230.1
, you have the choice to play five official gamemodes: -Arms Race -Deathmatch -Demolition -Casual -Competitive -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Summary of gamemodes: In Arms Race, the player gets weapons not by the money, but by killing people. Each two kills get you a new weapon. At the final stage of the weapon, you will get the Gold Knife. Kill someone with it, and you win. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Deathmatch, yes. In Deathmatch, it is like a "warm-up" or "practice" mode. For me, at least. In this gamemode, you join a server, and you just kill everybody you see, except your teammates. You can get weapons for free. There are also random occasions in which the game will tell you that a weapon currently has bonus points, and if you want to use that particular weapon, you press g by default. The person who gets the most points, wins. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So next in the list, is Demolition. It is set to be a 5 vs 5 match. It also has 20 rounds. The first team to get 11 rounds wins, and it can even finish with a tie. In the first half, you play as a set team. In the second, you play as the other team. You cannot buy any weapons, but instead, you get weapons by killing people, just like in Arms Race. Money is also not rewarded. But this is different: let's make a scenario. In (Round 1), you kill an enemy. the weapon will be rewarded to you on the next round. But what if you kill two in one round? You still get to advance to the next weapon, but you get a bonus grenade. For example: 2 kills: next wep + bonus grenade 3 kills: next wep + 2 bonus grenades Get the pattern? Yeah. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- What next? Oh, yeah. It's Casual. Casual is a 10vs10 game, with 15 rounds. The first team to get 8 wins, wins the match. It is split into two sub-gamemodes: Bomb Defusal (IIRC), and Hostage. Sorry, I don't know the exact names. In Bomb Defusal, there are two bomb sites. A and B. The Counter-Terrorists always have the Defusal Kit equipped, even if they didn't buy it. The kit shortens the defusal time from 10 to 5 seconds. The terrorists can freely choose which site they want to plant in. The bomb, iirc, has a 45 second timer. When defusing / planting the bomb, it makes a noise. Of course, the CTs are trying to stop them. Counter-Terrorists can win in two ways: killing all of the Ts before they plant the bomb, or defusing the bomb. For the terrorists, it's the same: killing all of the CTs, or making the bomb explode. So in Hostage, the roles are switched: the terrorists are now the defending side, and vice-versa. As the gamemode says, the Ts are holding some people hostage. And it is up to the CTs to get the hostages, or kill all of the Ts. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Finally, competitive. The competitive gamemode is much like the Casual gamemode, except a few differences: - Each kill has 2x more money reward than in Casual. - Defusal Kits / Rescue Kits cost money, and they don't get equipped automatically for free. - It's a 5v5. - Competitive has 30 rounds. - Each half has 15 rounds, and in both halves, you get to play as CTs and Ts. - Like the Demolition Gamemode, the match can end in a tie. - People are much more serious. -  blyat -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- So, here is my thoughts. CS:GO offers a large variety of gamemodes, and you can just see that I've written about all of them. Phew, that took a lot of time. Anyway, CS:GO is a very entertaining game, and each match has a different experience. Yes, CS:GO can be a bit too serious, but it is also a fun game. The community is not just a single person, you know. There are people who don't like you, and some don't care, but some will make your day better. GO is a game with a high skill ceiling. There is a huge learning curve to go in this game. It's like chess. Easy to learn, hard to master. I've met a huge amount of my friends in CS:GO, and I still talk to them. Some, I don't. Yeah. They'll be grumpy at times, but they inspire me. There are some bugs in this game, but not too gamebreaking. Just a few small ones. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you have  internet. Ping matters. I hope you know that CS:GO is available for consoles, too. In fact, VALVe talked about having cross-platform multiplayer, but that would be unfair for the console players, cause they have a delay in controls. I am 100% sure that VALVe completely abandoned Global Offensive in the console. The competitive scene is pretty huge, too. And a tournament even reached more than a million viewers! Online and in the tournament itself. It's only two years old, and it's already a big game. VALVe may not be the most listening, but they try. Except sometimes they make some aspects of the game turn to . Like the AWP. They reduced the movement speed while scoping. There are also skins in CS:GO. Some care about it, some don't. Just a matter of personal preference. I think they're part of why this game is popular. The most negative opinion I have, though, is about the Competitive gamemode. Sure, "no game is perfect", and the real fun is there, yeah, but the banning system needs some stuff to be taken care of. You know, just a few tweaks, like forgiving a person if he accidentally kills someone. It is pretty unforgiving. For who doesn't know, you can get banned for killing a teammate too many times, or leaving the game. If someone abandons your team, you can surrender. Not permanent bans, though. The VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) System also needs some fixing to be done. Some cheats aren't fully detected, so the hacker doesn't get VACed. From my experiences, I still haven't encountered a hacker, but that's probably because I'm a Silver. Some people can be real s. So that's my review. Hoped you like it! EDIT: I missed a few points, thanks > SKaREO About the netcode of CS:GO, truth be told, it HAS been really bad... for a few weeks now in fact. I go up to a guy and spray him, but most of the time it registers 2 or 3 hits out of 8 for example which could be lethal. Take note, that's in close quarters. No, that's not horrible aim. In the words of a truly horrible player, "omfg 64-tick sucks volvo pls 128-tick". Eh, doesn't really suck, just... well, mixed? In Global Offensive, there are a few advantages. Some on the T side, and some on the CT side. Hm, what's it called? Yeah, the perspective. Take this for an example, the "left shoulder advantage". |	731.4
| Here's an explanation: the player models hold guns on the right side. Therefore holding angles or peeking with left shoulder is more favorable as your model is less exposed. TheWarOwl has this video to make advantage of your perspective: |	1328.2
| And that's well-- unfair. Just like in real life, should I see your eyes, you will see mine, too. As I said earlier, VAC needs some fixing. It's terrible. And again, I still haven't played with any cheaters, so I can't fully review this part yet. Thanks.	1184.7

I will elaborate, but first I just want to throw out there that the gameplay is fantastic, I am not here to dispute that fact, but rather that a game that relies heavily on it's community to truly thrive is ultimately damaged by it in the long run, even if there are still a handful of people that do great things for this game, see the people that dish-out endless tutorials and tips such as WarOwl & 3kliksphillip for example. 9 times out of 10 you are likely going to have at least one player in the game who is either smurfing or cheating, (let's not even get into the odds of you getting a ton of griefers in the game altogether), some quick online searches will show up some results about how the anti-cheat measures are making very little difference, especially when some of the most proffessional and famous	410.9

The "third" game in the critically acclaimed First Person Shooter series that have shaped the PC gaming industry for years. Originally a mod for Half-Life turned into a stand-alone, had a Soruce sequel, and now Global Offensive. Counter-Strike 1.6 has long been one of the most played steam titles, seeing as the entire Steam platform was created with Counter-Strike in mind. Today Global Offensive have actually surpassed the original game in player base, something that Counter-Strike: Source failed to achieve. I was never a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, I always had a buddy or two that were better than me. Therefore I can't tell you the perspective from a experienced CS player. A lot of players were disappointed in Counter-Strike: Source because it did change too much of the core mechanics. Others were disappointed that the game did not change enough. Global Offensive apparently somehwhat succeeded in both those things in some mysterious way. Some core 1.6 players like it, and the game is relatively friendly and easy for newcomers. Of course there are still players who disagre and still value 1.6 or even CSS better. Counter-Strike Global Offensive offers the same team based versus mode, where you spawn, buy items, and you are free to move around the map to find the enemy players. The maps are never too big, and you always spawn in the same area. The main objective is to kill all enemy opponents, but there's also the classic objective of planting the bomb, or saving the hostages - depending on the map. Once you die, you have to wait for the round to finish before you respawn. Classic maps such as de_dust and cs_office have found their ways into this title as well. Same goes for most of the classic weapons, AWP, M4A4, AK-47 etc. Beside the classic competetive team vs team, there's Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race is a adoption of the classic "Gun Game" game mode from the original Counter-Strike, where the players are in a team deathmatch, and each kill will level up your weapon to the better. Demolition is a cross between Arms Race and classic "plant the bomb"-objective just on smaller maps. There are also time-specific events such as Operation Payback and Bravo, where players must buy a pass to play on community made maps and to support the creators. Just like any other modern Valve title, this game comes with all the Steam features including Steam Workshop, where people can share their created weapon skins and maps. Just like Dota 2, the items does not change the gameplay in any way, only cosmetic stuff. There is also weapon drops in game that players can get, with different range of rarities - To bring the Team Fortress 2 lootfest to this game as well.	1713.2

I haven't played much to be able to fully review it, sadly...

I think it's all because of some sort of rivalry due to an anual chicken chasing contest...	222.4

Let's put aside bad low rank community and concentrate on some real things! Gameplay 9/10 The gameplay itself is very good, every in-game control is easily adjustable, you can even change the crosshair. Crosshairs can be dots, squares and even triangles which is something that can really help you improve your skills and your gameplay experience. Graphics 8/10 As with in-game controls, it's same with graphics, there's many options which will help you utilize your settings. The game optimization is done pretty well, which is expected from Valve. The only problem is that there's a lot of pixel walking which we have seen even on the professional scene. Sound and voice acting 9/10 They have done it right, with quality headphones you can hear every opponents action, and take advantage of that. Voicing is beautiful, they vary from every character, they are with different accents and sometimes bad pronunciation , but that's something that makes it more realistic. My favorite voice impression is "I'm throwing smok". Game physics 7/10 Although it's a lot better from what we saw in "Counter-Strike: Source" and in "Counter-Strike" there's still some problems which might ruin your experience. Weapon recoil is done pretty well and they are similar to real recoils of those weapons, which is something that we don't see in every FPS game. Community 5/10 Yeah, yeah, I know, community isn't the best, but it really depends on your rank. As previously shown, lower rank equals to more trolls, harassers and leavers, but isn't it like that in every online game? When you are a higher rank you can still encounter toxic players, but they aren't a problem anymore, the real problem turn to be hackers . Valve is taking care of them pretty fast, but it seems like it's not fast enough. Overall experience 10/10 It has some problems, but I enjoyed and I'm still enjoying in this game. Everyone should at least try this game.	600.8

What is CSGO? CSGO is an ocean, the further down you go in rank the more you drown in speds and scrubs. Eventually you go past the point of no return and you simply cannot return to the surface, forced to suffocate beneath the waves being dragged down by anchors and asphyxiate from the high pitched shrieks of " Rego on this server".	2015.8
I want to like this game. I really do. But there's just a few quirks I can't get past. (Nothing about gameplay or anything like that). For whatever reason, I dont feel like coming home and playing CS:GO for hours as I do with other games. Also the community is really mean to new players for some odd reason. My first competetive game, I had people calling me a  just because wasn't going to the right place. When I'm the last alive and I lose a gunfight, I get kicked for nothing in particular. And when I'm playing with my friends and I don't understand how I haven't hit the person, my friends tell me,	63.7

Great game that can teach you many things such as: 1. The Russian language. 2. How to be a tough guy that is afraid of nothing behind a screen. 3. How to be racist and sexist. 4. How to be spoiled as . 5. How awesome it feels to shout through your microphone and giving invalid instructions while someone is trying to pull off a clutch. 6. How to be disappointed in human beings. 7. How to socialise in a civilised and calm manner (/s). And last but not least. How to be a complete  for no reason at all. Aside from that, if you're willing to ignore the aforementioned it can be a truly great game. It has many goals for you to achieve if you wish other than the obvious goal of getting the highest ranking possible. You could always aim to get that gorgeous weapon skin you always wanted potentially without spending any money at all. It is highly recommended you find a few people to play with as solo queue is extremely toxic, harsh and often rude, as in every other game that has competitive matchmaking. Having 4 people to play with can be extremely fun since you can easily bond together and have fun either you win or lose. It's a good game and I do recommend it as long as you're willing to ignore the (Admittedly plenty of) things that are wrong with this game. Even if you don't, it can easily be worth it if your skin is thick enough or you can utilise (If you got the balls really) self-deprecation humour.	587.0

Really good game. Very simple, yet complex at the same time. For first time players: DO NOT let the game's recoil mechanics scare you away. It will take some time to get used to but once you do, it is a great game. PROS: [+] -Great community (COMPARED TO SOME OTHER GAMES) -Frequent updates -Tradable stuff -Source Engine means that players from GMod, CS 1.6/Source, etc. won't (or at least shouldn't) have a hard time adapting to new controls and physics. -VERY Competitive at higher levels -Tons of workshop files and tons of room to make your own skins and maps -Weapon skins -Multiple modes for casual or competitive and more -High FPS on almost any PC (great optimization) CONS: [-] -Skins can be expensive or worthless -Skins and cases can suck the money out of you if you let it -Recoil is not very easy to get used to -No aiming down sights (FOR NEW PEOPLE, CALM DOWN VETS) -Cooldowns can be handed out unfairly -Low graphic quality/detail compared to other games (IT IS SOURCE, CALM DOWN) -MP only (if you are reading this, you most likely have internet at home, THERE IS A BOTS ONLY OPTION) -Hackers do like to hack in competitive matches at higher levels -Callouts are not that easy to learn for beginners OVERALL: Get it. If it is on sale, CS:GO is an even better deal. The recoil was my biggest challenge at the start but just take some time to practice with bots. Perfect for traders, casual FPS players, competitive FPS players, and workshop content creators. RATING: 9.5/10	1417.5
"420/10 not as good as skyrim its alright i guess though" -#IGN	709.6
When I reviewed Counter-Strike Source a few years ago, I called it things like "immortal" and "the definitive multiplayer FPS." The Awp is easily one of the most satisfying weapons in gaming. Quickscoping and noscoping can be a gamble - I really like the balance and precise feel of the Awp. The rest of the weapons feel really good - there is much more variety here: we are talking custom weapon skins and even a custom loadout for each team. This is one of the areas where CS:GO shines, and leaves its predecessors in the dark ages. Competitive matchmaking is one of the really nice features of Global Offensive. The game allows you to play in competitive matches based on your skill level rating. This is done similar to the matchmaking in Dota 2. While not perfect, I find the matchmaking to be pretty accurate - it is rarely a cakewalk. Always be wary of the player community for this game - this community has some sick and twisted people, tons of trolls, smack talkers, hack accusers, mic spammers, and cry babies, lol. Fortunately you can mute players, and if you are so inclined, can vote them off the game - nice! Trading and items drops are a fairly big part of the game as well. One of the neat things about the game is you can easily sell back your in game drops via Steam market and basically play this game for free or even profit from it. its insane, but some items sell for over $400 USD. CS:GO is on the rise reaching peaks near 300,000 players. There are huge tournaments played, and with each passing month the game sees positive growth. I think its safe to say this is the new "definitive multiplayer FPS"! 9/10	480.1

I've wasted over 200 hours of my pathetic life on this  game. Its not even fun its the exact same thing over and over again. Just like my life. Anyway, you can get new skins. Also, instead of fixing hitboxes, weapons, and servers, Valve released new summer skins, so while you get ed in the head you can inspect your weapon. Also, every single game I join I get called  for how I sound, and god forbid that you actually want to have fun. This game, will want to make you rethink your puny existince on this galaxy, and about how you are spending it shooting the same  over and over. New Stat Traks thoo####### Cant even spell Track right the ing . 10/10 Would try to kill myself again Thx Valve UPDATE I have now.... 542 hours in this game. I have wasted another 300 hours of my life, with this thing going on in my head. Now now, I know what you may be thinking. 300 hours? There surely must be some improvements with this game between then and now. HahahahahHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA I just got banned, for no being able to reconnect to a match. Not my fault, I was online, everything was going swell. DANDY. Until it kicked me out, and banned me. I final  shot in the eye. This game....has ruined my entire life. I could of done so much with my life, been something, but csgo took my lifes goals. I couldnt balance it out. This game grasps you by your balls, brings you to your knees, shoots its load in your mouth, then makes you feel like a piece of  swallowing One thing when you are playing this game to remember is that, it is never VALVES fault. It is always your fault. Everything in this game is well designed, elaborate, and rich, with team based elements. That is until you actually play the game. Then you realize everyone is as big of a ing  as you are. I hate this game, it ruined my life, it ruined my dreams, it ruined me. I never want to play this game again, I never want to see it again. I want to bury it under six feet of dirt. LOL @ ZOMBYE CHICKENS LOLOLOLOLOL HAHAH MASKS thats GR8 I can feel Like A VILLIAN DANKS VALVE. I have no reason to live anymore. 10/10 would reccomend if masochist, depressed, suicidal, or a GIANT.....ING.....LOSER Or if ur like me, and all of the aboVE.	739.5
I bought cs:go for the storyline and the mmo feeling i haven't had since World of Warcraft.A few people ask me how the hell i speak russian and what is the fastest way to learn it.The answer is obivious...

CS:GO is very realistic, the biggest similarity with real life being the fact that they both suck balls. Also, don't forget to buy our keys for only $2.49 for a chance to get a gun with a texture made in GIMP in 5 minutes that makes it look like a Hot Wheels toy.	41.4

This game is truly amazing. Launching it is like a gateway drug, to more Counter Strike. If you want some tense, nervewracking clutch situations, Competitive is for you, but be warned; Silvers will do the most messed up tactics, call you a hacker if you see them or kill them, or if you even win a game, i never knew how many 12 year olds had ed so many people's mums there is not enough lifevests left. However, there are some good community servers too, full with Surf, HS Deathmatch, Jailbreak, BHop etc. which is good until you meet the admins, 90% of admins are 12 year old donators who abuse the  out of their power	626.9
This game has a feature were you can turn $2.50 into 10! Then you bet that 10 skin you just got on CSGO lounge to try and make your money back, but then lose the bet. Outraged you decide to buy another key, hoping that this will make up your money by pulling a knife, only to find that you got another 10 skin. Hundreds of dollars later, finally you think you have learnt your lesson, to not buy keys and decide to buy a skin straight off the market for full price. Being still resonably new to the game, you click the unknown link, unaware of what is going on, you later realise that you have been scammed. Thats right that skin you bought, more expensive then the game, and all 10 skins you have purchased for $2.50 are gone. Outraged once again, you start this process all over, this time knowing the chances of you pulling a knife and making your money back are extremely, slim, but you feel that this will be the one, lol nope get rekt son, 69 skin.	439.0
First Off... Im not sure when Trolls, Smurfs, and Hacks began to become the norm, but the game is broken. They put it on sale for 5.00. Kids buy it just to hack it. Valve knows, they dont care. And all we do is BUY BUY BUY skins. I mean 400.00 for a knife skin? WTF?!??!!? Didnt we used to be able to get those for free? The guys hacking have a customer service number to call if they cant set it up correctly. Hacking is Big Business. They took 12 name tags from me, all because of 1 off-color gun name. Meanwhile, vulgarity far worse than my gun name, is allowed to cheat, troll, and make the game unplayable. Because its funny to watch people get pissed. And valve does nothing but put the game on sale. And kids, Rememer. When you tell ghame developers that your ok with paying 65.00 + 35 or 50 for the "season pass". You set what the market will bear. Thus making games MORE expensive for us, and limiting how much fun you can really have with it. Cuz if you cant afford the season pass.. you dont get all that content. CSGO is setting an example of how to take all of your customers money, and make them happy they did it. Maybe they put it on sale so that you can afford to have 3 copies of they game. 1 for rank, 1 for smurfing, and 1 for hacking...	894.5

It's Best first person shooter game available on Steam. Community is very much active and game is updating every month and so. Good official servers and support. Awesome. Better graphics, new guns that have been update from CSS, and the game itself is similar to CSS, which in my opinion is a great thing and it's only $15. Overall Great game.	950.2
Years of playing overrated AAA shooting games with lens flares, blood on the corners of your vision, and blue everything have since taken me away from the good old primative day of filling in the shoes of generic swat teams fighting generic terrorists; of which both groups lack the ability to look down the sights of all but a few weapons. Then I found Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Being set eight years after the events of the previous game, there are noticeable changes brought upon by the passage of time. For example, the cognitive ability of hostages have further decreased to the point where they can't walk on their own. Moreover, both the terrorists and counter-terrorists adpoted new-found language ability. Finally, as we've evolved from the black and white days to being able to see the world in color, the world of Source has evolved drasticly in it's graphics in the eight-year gap between games. Among the new things introduced are atom-wide ledges, birds of superavian strength, and a modernized Russian train station which pays tribute to the skillful, fun to play with, and polite players of the Motherland. Finally, Counter Strike: Global Offensive has gone above and beyond the expectations of being an emergant AAA title by introducing an economy system that teaches rich naive kids the harshness of the post-2008 economy. Bravo. I've only played a bit of it but I will reward this game with a 9/10 for it's advanced chicken AI and the hyper-realistic sounds they make when you caress them with knifes in a fashion akin to spreading butter.	647.8
Since i started to play counter strike global offensive a new world opened for me! With all the tactics i learned from this game life has become easier for me. Whenever i'll go running im sure to take a knife with me so i can run even faster then i usually do! I made a fake bomb and painted an A on the floor in the living room. Whenever i come out of the shower i wrap my towel around my head and pretend to be a terrorist. I pick up the bomb i made and run around in my house. When i reach the living room i plant it on the "A" side and make some beeping sounds. Sometimes my dog gets close to me when i plant and he starts to lick my rectal opening. I think this is just one of the side effects of playing this game. My family thinks i'm crazy and my girlfriend left me because of it. This game has become life for me and i don't know what i should do without it. Thank you Gaben, i accept you as my lord and saviour. Gaben is love, Gaben is life.	1211.6

Pros: its a great reason to upgrade to a new tv / monitor (because you punched it) its a great way to learn multiple languages. you get to pwn some COD noobbbsssszzzz and show em how its done your family will starve because you spent all your money on keys... but its okay tho... they only annoyed you! you will find alot of people with girl pics ;) and also you will get to shout at the poor souls of the noobs when they dont clutch..

I love this game! If you decide to buy this game here's 10 Tips: 1) Your ears are your eyes. 2) Echo = Eco 3) AVP = AWP 4) Top left you have radar. Learn to use it. 5) The guns have rubber barrels so when you hold the trigger for more than 3 shots, the bullets will go all over the screen. 6) P90 was crafted by Gods so it's users are not hackers. 7) If you have the bomb, sit behind your team like a good dog. 8) The game's secret name is Counter-Strike: Dust 2. 9) Competitive is the main game mode but there are other modes for your little kids too! 10) If you easily get brain cancer just from losing one match STAY AWAY FROM COMPETITIVE! you psycho! P.S. I'm not a doctor.	312.2

My brother is an "avid amateur chess player". That's how he describes himself when making small talk. You should see his room. It's full of dumb chess pieces from different sets, like his favorite Gold Pawn. It's not really gold but he claims it is. (Nobody believes him) So anyway, one time I went to his room and I saw new addition to his collection. It was a giant paper mache bishop. Like, 3 feet tall. He obviously made it himself because it was crooked and I saw yesterday's news on the Bishop's belly. But what really attracted me to the giant bishop was its unproportionally small head. The whole thing was like a freaky baby milk bottle. So approached the artifact, and I bit the tip off. Unfortunately for me, my brother saw me do it. Unfortunately for him, I move as quick as a fox. I was a dancing blur of after image, avoiding every attack he tried to throw at me. I slipped past him and dashed straight to the safety of my dad's room. I locked myself in until the angry beast outside calmed down. Then I asked myself,	61.5

It took me sometime before i decided to review this game but here we go! After 200 hours betweeen Competitve and Casual i would love to say this game is AWESOME . Counter Strike:Global Offensive is the perfect mariage between indvidual skill and teamwork . A game you enjoy watching as much as you enjoy playing it . Skins and Unboxing Addiction , well hard to talk about this as much as its a real addiction i personally have and waste of moeny but it helps great in the growing of the game and its fanbase . The Game is Overall a great game despite the amount of money i spent on virtual items in this game xD i am really glad i bought this game and i regret not playing previous CS games ,	309.6
Sexu skins 10/10	1308.1
High potential, but that's about it. -Worst community of any game I have seen in my 20 years -Regular players just  about how matchmaking and the like suck all the time -Ridiculous amount of scammers for pathetically expensive skins -Joining servers is still the same as it was a decade ago -Hardly fleshed out at all, including competitive -Encourages kids to throw their parents money at the wall -Getting into the game is nigh-impossible with incredibly unwelcoming casual community, and incredibly elitist competitive community -Why do the characters hands look ? -Every update makes the game stutter like crazy for some people. +Great physics and maps. If you buy this game don't take it seriously or you'll end up sad, confused, and devoid of money I have 4000 hours in garry's mod but at least I got laid because of it	170.7

Great game, nice skins overall and the game is pretty fun but there is one thing that I have to complain about and that's server tick. Competitive servers use 64 tick servers and esports use 128 tick servers. This causes more lag and a slightly difference in aiming. 64 Tick servers seem to be off (for me) my cursor is on them and the shots do not connect (Ping is fine and under 50). I would still recommend this game to friend. P.S - Stop putting this game on sale it's the cause of mass hackers and smurds (Not a typo) Smurfing nerds. <3 Pros: - Nice Gun Skins - In Game Voice Chat - In Game Item Drops - Competitive Scene Cons: - On Sale Often (Allows more cheater and smurf accounts) - Server Tick 64 (Could be 128 and valve has the money)	1143.5
Looks and feels very similar to the older games in the series. You can still have fun even if you're not the best player with the competitive matchmaking system; You'll get grouped with people around the same skill level as you and the system seems to work pretty well. The game goes on sale for less than $7.50 frequently so there really is no excuse not to try it out!	39.1
Honestly, whether you can aim or not is irrelevant. The TRUE definition of skill is your ability to argue with everyone. people being put into 5v5 teams is just to create the illusion of a team game. It's actually 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1. Whoever rustles the most jimmies wins. Also just like to add that the Russians are currently dominating at this sport at the moment.	341.0
Counter Strike Global Offensive is a worthy successor of Counter Strike 1.6: - The graphics are great - It has all the good old maps - Fun gameplay - New guns - Sound-quality and weapon-models are better - Over 50.000 items and maps on Workshop This is the best Counter Strike imo. 10/10*	604.8
It's surely the best CS so far, if you can overlook the fact that competitive matchmaking ranks mean nearly nothing, as well as if you can deal with being kicked and consequentially put in matchmaking cooldown by a team of four people. You can also invest few thousands of dollars to buy fancy weapons. A good game in the end, but only if you play it with friends.	713.8
CSGO is the international Soviet Communication System (SCS) and it was built by Vladimr Putin himself to give russians a communication system to talk with each other! Oh, and also by this so called GAME we got to know that russians are s running around and screaming how pathetic everyone exept other russians are. This game is about Putin/10    . And of course i recommend this game lol it has RUSSIANS!!!	217.9
Buy P90 + kevlar and helmet, some flashes and you are ready to go for Global Elite.	1082.6
Best competetive "guess where hitbox is", "99 in 16 hits" and crate opening simulator for true MLG players. You have beautiful classic 10x10 metres square maps to test your tactical genius, truely realistic feeling of shooting with airsoft weapons with stunning purple camo and banana stickers on them. Will i eco or will i buy after lost pistol round? It doesn't matter because at "master guardian elite" level and below your teammates will buy and die anyway and there's nothing you can do about it, since they're speaking on horrific Lovecraftian languages. Good thing skill levels make a difference and ELO works in team games, right? You just have to reach Global Elite or train your real life friends in special camps for 5 years to have competent teams and enjoyable rounds. You can play on Dust 2, Mirage or Cache, because search for other maps takes forever, which is good because these legitimate tournament maps don't reward people for " krisa" gameplay. Weapon spray act just like it should: it works in preprogrammed pattern so you must remember spray of every weapon if you want to kill , because if you just sit with ak and shot static target right in the head, you might actually miss! It aint 1.6 anymore, scrub! It works kinda like japaneze Touhou games: you play for 100 hours to remember every pattern and then you're good to go to play on  competetive servers where hitboxes travel in outer space and none of it actually matters. Anti-cheat system works like a charm! People can just buy csgo gift for 1 dollar at some web service, other guys can exchange it for a crate that drops every now and then, play 10 games with wh and aim and get up to "distinguished master guardian" just in 4 hours or less. Then you will be delighted to play against them as they rush middle at dust 2 making 5 headshots as fast as rmb can be pressed. But no worries! Since VAC doesn't work properly, developers added Community Overwatch where you can spent up to 10 minutes looking at some guy running at light speeds with negev spinning like a yoyo killing everything! Without even slightest reward or weapon skins you like so much you can do developers' job at cleaning off the cheaters! As for the graphics, since Source they added motion blur.	742.3
This game tought me that: -Killing chikens worths the same as killing terrorists -Everyone can be Russian -Terrorsits get Dollar for killing Americans -It doesn't matter, if you win or lose, you get money anyways -You can be noob because of anything -You can be kicked for everything -Giving headshots means you're a hacker -Getting headshots means you're a noob -The guy with the least points gets drops -12 years old will  your mother -P90 is op -Scar20 is op -A+ on Russian exam 110/10	606.1

I used to be playing FPS like Call Of Duty, battlefield,Medal Of Honor and even been addicted to PayDay. But Counter-Strike is a FPS on a whole different level. Its hard, Challenging and far from what most are probably used too but its so much fun. A must have for everybody that loves FPS! Dont let the price fool you. This game if far beyond awesome than most FPS which u pay around 60 euros for or more. You play matches with people in your own skill rank and u rank up when you get better. You dont have to worry to get in the game and be shooted by people that are 50 ranks higher than you. the game runs smooth, looks really good and you can play deathmatch against bots and other people, or competitively & Alone. Its highly addictive and for the price it is right now definitely worth trying. Incase you buy it (Which u should!) Have fun	1154.1
One of the worst competitive systems ever designed	164.7
While played this game, I was globaly offended. 11/10 Would get offended again!	463.3
This is a honest review of the game Counter Strike Global Offensive or CSGO. Lets just start off by saying that previous counter strike games really have been amazing. Now CSGO is the newest installment in the series. What seems and is a fun game is plauged with problems. Lets start off by the community. The CSGO community is one of the most toxic communities out there just as bad as the Dota2 Community. They will put down new players, troll and just overall have BM while playing the game. Really valve does nothing to punish "Griefers" and others so the trolling will never really end. Another Problem is hackers. Hackers plauge the world of csgo at all ranks and skill levels. Some may be blatant and some may be more conservative. Point is that valve has really not done anything to fight hackers. VAC sucks and takes weeks to ban a hacker, while overwatch has been implemented its a time consuming process that cant always be accurate. Because of the low price of the game hackers can make endless accounts and continue to feed valve the 15 dollars for csgo so that they can continue to ruin other peoples time. Valve really has ignored the community in many ways aswell. Not implementing 128 tick servers, adding stupid stuff like Music intros to players and not doing productive things like fixing exploits or overpowered things like grenade tagging. A massive problem is also skins. They may look pretty but they ruin the game. Now I understand that valve will never take skins out of the game because it is a massive amount of revenue for them. But skins really only lead to professional players throwing matches... Nothing can really be done about this as much as the big Orgas (organizations) try to stop it from happening. Players will find a way to do it and will throw for skins when competing in small tournaments. Smurfs are considered a problem by some but I see no feaseable way to stop them so I will not be talking about that. Surrendering is also an issue. Teams playing competitive matchmaking can surrender a game but only IF one of the players decides to sacrifice himself and abandon the match getting a cooldown. When playing against a hacker in addition to getting aimbotted time after time 1 player must be punished for abandoning the match in order for the team to forfeit. This game CAN be good but valve is not doing what they need to do to fix the issues and instead adds their cash grabs to the game. The issues will persist and more and more players will leave the game. This game had great potential and is fun at first until you play enough. Then you ake notice and you wait for every patch that is supposed to fix things just to see that it is a new set of skins for some new stupid collection. Today I will be leaving CSGO maybe not forever but until they fix their issues I will not be coming back. TLDR: Great game with TONS of issues that valve gives zero s about. Rating 3/10	719.4

Do not open cases, for the love of god. You see that you have $5+ on your steam account. You feel the urge that you will get "an exceedingly rare special item" You spend $2.50 and open a case. Tick tick tick..... It stops on a blue gun. You feel this depression, but also this rush going to your head. You decide to spend another $2.50 believing that this special key is the one to get you "an exceedingly rare special item". Tick tick tick... time slows down as the line scrolls past multiple useless gun skins. You see it.... Time stops and you look at that beautiful Yellow Circle. Somehow, you manage to calculate the rate at which the line is travelling to determine if it will land on the yellow circle. You can also apparently have a very large IQ during this short time frame. You heart starts to beat much quicker, you know that it's going to land. You know you can finally brag to your friends that you got a knife from a case. You are so excited you almost knock the glass off the table... But your whole life flips upside down... You realise you failed Physics in High School and that your calculations were completely off. You see it... The line stopped 1 tick away from your beautiful Factory New Stat trak Karambit | Fade. You see that cursed Mil-Spec Skin worth 7c on the Steam Market. You press the Power button on your computer and walk over to your bed. You lie down and close your eyes, tears running down your face. You then overdose on Wizz Fizz and commit Sodoku 11/10 A must buy	2517.7

This game is like doing cocain. When you first start it doesn't seem very appealing, and maybe it hurts a little. But then you experence this rush, and you have to have more. And the more you do it the better you are at it. You know it's taking up all your time, and you try to stop. But the game exits, and you stare at your desktop. A tear falls from your face as you hit "play" again. 10/10 would get addicted	618.5

I can't stop playing this game. It has consumed countless hours of my life, and I want out, but I can't. Too much money is invested, to many hours are played. I can't stick with any other games because csgo is the only game I ever play. I have an unhealth addiction that no amount of seven day bans can extinguish. My friends have constantly recommended other games, and given me suggestions, but I can't escape from the repetitive torment to Counter Strike Global Offensive. I'm to involved to drop out, but dropping out of the game's flow is my only hope. It is torture. Valve studios should drink bleach for making it. Screw this god damn game, NEVER download it and never play it repeatedly. You'll just end up like me, with no escape from the cyclone that is Counter-Strike Global Offensive.	862.1

WOW... Just wow... Smurfs, Jerks and hackers! DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME COMPETETIVE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN !!! (Unless, fun to you is getting aggravated, being yelled at for not playing good and not knowing everything about the game.) If you wish to gain a good rank, join a team who will help you get carried or boost you for money. As for ranking up as an individual the only way to do that, is to have friends who have the proper skills for a highly competetive gameplay and all you have to do is plant or defuse the bomb while they cover for you... You then learned nothing. :/ That makes it a TEAM GAME I guess. That way you can gain team points PER ROUNDS WIN and that is all !!! Kill / death ratio doesn't matter anymore, you are as GOOD or as CRAP as your team is. Level up with your freinds or they will soon not play with you and you get stuck in what is referred to as "silver hell." Good luck getting out of that because, it means allot of headaches as these teams will consist of players who legit "don't know what they are doing" againt players who purchased a secondary account and posess the seemingly PRO SKILLS you DO NOT when you're wanting to learn and get better at competetive gameplay. You'll just end up getting killed by them, your team will yell at you and you will suffer though a horrible loss, becuse you cannot abandon a match without receiving a "cooldown time" an you will learn NOTHING!!! These higly skilled players with secondary low rank accounts are so called "smurfs." They are a form of cyberbullies who like stroke their own d***ks while they play against inexperienced players who are trying to figure out how to play better. All the while smufrs are calling you names, aggravating you and causing team moral to drop. Soon your whole team is yelling at you and practially forcing you to quit and once again you learned nothing... Do yourself a favor and don't pay for mental anguish! GLHF! (Good luck, have fun. Which this game is neither!) -----Update 1------ Yes, a bit of clearing up is need even if this review is long enough as is. One part I agree with Pete, the casual and deathmatch modes are flooded, where the competitive side is strictly teams of 5 v 5. As in how to deal with smurfs and hackers is not that straightforward. No one plays comp to purposely loose. (Unless you're trolling or want to derank your account.. but why!?) Face it, loosing sucks but specially when item drops have also been reduced to nothing and when they do they are items that are in extremely bad condition and worth only a few cents. Then the only way to battle the smurfs is to have friends who are willing to teach you the game. That way when you pull together as a team, utilize your grenades well, pay attention to positioning and aim, you will have a fighting chance because usually the smurf is the last one or two player(s) alive. Only then it could be made into a monster! :D Good luck and (try to) have fun! ----Update 2----- Thanks for all the responses everyone! The rank and matchmaking system is for the lack of a better word, is bonkers! :D I actually enjoy helping new players with tips and hints on getting better. It's just something I've gotten to a great liking of eversince leading the CS:S division of a multigaming clan back in those days. One other thing recently occurred to me while playing CS:GO, is that hours played and kill / death ratio should also come into factor. For instance, when I started out in CS:GO I was invited to comp matches by friends who are in the range of Nova-2 to Master Guardian ranks. I've quickly received my Silver Master Elite rank, which I went onto advance into the mid Nova range. Solo queing and just general messing around (once the game was an inevitable loss) I have managed to derank my account to the mid silver range. I keep performing in the mid range of the score board also, but its by choice because I've came to accept the fact that its going to take me a reeaallyy long time to gain my nova ranks back. When I'm asked to pull it together its not hard for me to get kills, give good strats and sometimes even start to carry my team. I just cant help but be frustrated when I do constantly perform good and is top mvp and every 10 game or more still not budge a rank. GLHF, but most importantly HAVE FUN because that's up to each and every one of us to enjoy the game even if its a bit broken!	1347.5

Originally designed as a Half-Life mod more than a decade ago, Counter-Strike has endured because of its well-balanced, competitive gameplay that requires skill to succeed. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a revamped version of the classic first-person shooter, offering some tweaked modes on the same maps that helped define the series. Those unfamiliar with Counter-Strike will find the game more a cerebral experience instead of the run n gun, arcade-style action popularized by recent iterations of Call of Duty. In Global Offensive, there is no regenerating health, no cinematic storyline, no experience points to level up your soldier, and no unlockable kits or perks. The deterrent for dying is having to sit out and watch as the rest of the match unfolds. While this may sound disappointing to those weaned on more contemporary shooters, Global Offensive' comparatively pared-down experience is no less thrilling. The game's focus on teamwork and tactics gives the game a distinctive feel as you choose between four online game types as part of a terrorist or counter-terrorist faction. Classic Casual and Classic Competitive are team-based modes played in multiple rounds. The goal in each is to either eliminate the opposition or be the first team to complete a map-related objective. Depending on the map and your faction, you'll either rescue or defend four hostages, or either plant or defuse bombs at two specific sites. While the goals in both Classic Casual and Classic Competitive are the same, the differences between the two are primarily in terms of scope. A Classic Competitive game consists of 30 rounds instead of 10, enables friendly fire, and has you earning money for kills, planting bombs, and so forth that's used to purchase armor and defuse kits. The casual variant gives you armor and defuse kits automatically. The other two modes consist of Arms Race and Demolition. Arms Race, which has been adopted by both Call of Duty: Black Ops and Battlefield 3's Close Quarters expansion, consists of a single round where everyone begins with the same weapon. Each kill automatically changes your weapon until you receive the golden knife. The first person that lands the killing blow with the knife wins the round. This is the only mode where respawns are possible, offering a nice change of pace from the standard modes. Demolition is a mash-up of Arms Race and Classic, taking the fixed weapon progression from Arms Race and including two multi-round matches that have you trying to plant or defuse a bomb in a bank, safe house, and other locales. What makes Counter-Strike: Global Offensive appealing is that it plays differently from its competition. Tired of jumping assassins in other games? Jumping here will penalize your accuracy. Sick of seeing more praying and spraying than in a baptism ceremony? Then you'll appreciate that those who use short, controlled bursts while aiming will be more successful. If there is one knock on the game, it's that it offers the same maps as earlier versions of the series, giving veterans a huge advantage over new players. To offset this, the developers included an option to play against bots offline so you can practice each mode and map. This will give you a fighting chance against "real" players, but expect to die early and often until you hone your skills and familiarize yourself with the map layouts. Or course, the most important aspect of any multiplayer game is how much you want to play after a session ends. This is where Global Offensive excels, possessing the same addictive quality that helped make the previous games a long-term success story. Shooter fans looking to diversify their library or prove their mettle against a talented pool of players shouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger.	63.7

That type of game which could relate to sweet old times of 90s when games were both challenging and simple enough to offer thousands of hours of gametime and still not being completely satiated. CSGO puts the CS title back on top of the competetive games and is a rightful king with undefeated throne for a long, long time. The skillcap of this game ranges from a total casual player to a hardcore pro and cannot be described be words how many factors differentiate a pro from a noob. This is the true and only FPS online game to play in 2014 onwards.	670.4

If CS:GO was a girl. I'd date her, and  her a lot. Then after that get frusterated because of things she does that doesn't make sense but still be with her. Then we'd have sex again. When we're in bed I'd be killin' it ontop, but when she's ontop I just absolutely hate it as she dominates me. After that we'd get into a fight about who was better that round and we'd always end the fight at a negative note. The next day I'd start talking to her again and the cycle goes on and on. CS:GO is the equivalent to an abusive relationship. 10/10 would recommend just because being ontop feels pretty good in this game.	42.6

I first came to cs from tf2 and a couple other single player games, being recommended it by a few of my online friends. I expected: A badly made, generic shooter filled with gimmicks to keep the player interested and a pay to win sort of system. I recieved: An absolutely amazing game with lots of depth and an insane amount of skill and strategy involved. At first I found the amount of effort, skill and stategy you have to put into player positioning and things of that nature was just astounding, and unlike any other game I had seen before. I took a massive liking to this type of game and started playing more and more. At first you will have difficulty understanding these things but putting more time and effort into the game will show results quickly. I just wanted to do a review of this game as I believe CS:GO is truly great and unlike any other game out there! Thanks for reading! ~envy	1373.0

I purchased this game on release day and played it for about three hours. It was absolute crap and I un-installed it. Fast forward almost one year and my friend recommended I try it again. Well, i've got to say that the game has come a long way and has vastly improved from it's release version. The game is basically 1.6 with improved graphics and mechanics. While it still needs work in many areas, the current state of the game is highly enjoyable and worth the mediocre price of $14.99. If you're a long time CS player like me (Beta 1) and don't have this game yet, add me to your friends list and we'll reminisce about the old days and maybe i'll throw a copy your way.	362.3
I'll start off by saying that I haven't played CS:GO all that much yet, but here are some of my first impressions of the game: -The actual gameplay is flawless and it offers more than enough customization options to ensure your comfortability with the controls. There is also a huge abundance of guns, maps and unique game types to pick from. -I'm sure a lot of people are discouraged by the extremely high skill cap but I feel that the game's increased difficulty, relative to other first-person shooters, makes it much more rewarding. It is way more satisfying when you do finally get the hang of it. :) -I typically don't pay any attention to the chat/voice communication in multiplayer games such as this, but I quietly observed it from time to time for the sake of this review. I can tell you that just like in many other games, the community can be pretty toxic towards new players and just in general. Ignore the rage and you'll be fine. :P -CS:GO has a workshop with loads of community made maps that introduce unique game-modes and styles. It goes without saying that this adds hours, maybe even days, to the replayability and allows you as the player to better customize the way you play and enjoy the game. Overall, it's an awesome game and I only wish I had picked it up sooner! If you can handle the somewhat toxic community and the high skill cap, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the perfect first-person shooter and I recommend it! :)	96.4
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, is probably the most balanced Fps game in all existence. I personally started playing Counter Strike when Source had been out for 2-3 years or so. I've always enjoyed the close quarters strategic combat, and the fact that the game is all skill. The're are no unlockables, the only things you can "earn" by playing are stats, and skins. A pro player will have no statistic advantage over a gamer that's new to the series, other than his skill. +Great Engine +Great Servers +Balanced Gameplay +Smooth Gameplay +Excellently constructed maps +Stays true to the franchise +Cheap -No unlockables (except skins) -InGame purchases with real money Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the best competition style First person shooter Valve has ever made so far. Theres nothing else to the game than multiplayer (and the braindead bots). This is a must have for all PC gamers. If you dont already have the game, pick it up now, or get it on the christmas sale, in a couple of weeks. 9,5/10	210.7
This modern version of one of the best competitive games of all times does a good job in introducing new players to this highly tactical and skill-based gaming experience. If you are a veteran of the old days  CS:GO might disappoint you. It sure looks nice but lacks the precision that made CS 1.6 so damn good. Its still a very good Counter-Strike, though.It may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps, and little features of past games, but Global Offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking Counter-Strike for whoever wants it. Even if the community doesn't meet the golden standard of 1.6 and Source, CS:GO will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.Brilliant old-school shooter has convinced us that Counter-Strike franchise is in no way to be retired or forgotten.At the end, what matters is not if CS:GO is innovative or more of the same than CS: Source, what counts is if it's fun. And CS:GO couldn't be better in this regard.	1011.8
I sure do love $400.00 knife reskins	37.4
The community consists of: A. People that blame you for "lag switching" (which isn't even possible in Source) B. Dudebros, neckbeards, manchilds... C. Players that scream in mic D. Griefing in competitive God, it doesn't end there. This community has the WORST COMMUNITY I've ever seen in the history of gaming. It even surpasses Left 4 Dead 2! TL;DR don't get this for any reason, ever.	488.3
Another great game to waste some time :D	100.9

It's hard to argue that this game is probably the best CS release since 1.6. Some will disagree, might argue Source is a better game and they will have their own valid points. In my opinion this game is a true sequel. It brings the fun and nostalgia from the earlier versions of CS, the same flowing game play that made it popular and the heavy emphasis on team game play. It mates the old with the new; the expectations that a FPS be somewhat realistic if not fun to play. It's a modern game; it looks and plays like modern games should but it all looks a bit familiar, like the hot girl from years past that you bump into 10 years later. CS:GO is more technical and team oriented than previous games in the series. Shooting, movement, sound and grenades are completely different and you have to master them once again. Weapons now have a purpose - there's a reason to buy the 5-7 and P250, as well as the MP5 replacement, MP7. Team play is just as important as the economy; once you lose it there's no coming back. It's a demanding skills based that's as satisfying as any CS title has been.	1144.4
- Updated maps, visuals & sounds - Emphasis on team play - Valve online matchmaking as well as valve casual servers - Extensive customisability & player drops - More realistic player and game behaviour - CS:GO workshop - Pro players - Active development and regular updates - Listens to community - Low-end modern PC requirements for top quality & top resolution	240.0
- Gungame isn't the same as CS:S - Because of different skills & tactics, CS:S players will feel like it's a familiar but new game. Skills are transferrable one way, not so much the other; when you play CS:S after CS:GO it will feel and sound like you're playing underwater. - Sound still seems like an afterthought - You will need to upgrade your video card to something made in the last 3 years if you want something that's playable and looks good	805.9
Graphics: 8.5/10, far improved on previous models but there's still room for improvement Sound: 8/10, feels like an after-thought, if there's one complaint I have about the game it is that the sound quality and engine just isn't good enough Gameplay: 9.5/10, excellent and extremely playable game with very high replayability Overall: 8.5/10, it's a great game and could easily be 9.5 out of 10 with improved audio and slight improvements in visual quality. It's a modern twist on an old classic.	1013.7
I lost my way with CS after CS:S and I turned to a variety of other games. Battlefield 1942/2142/2/3, Tom Clancy Rainbow 6, America's Army 2/3/PG. Before then I was an avid player of CS and I would play up to 100 hours per month. When I played CS 10 years ago I always asked, why can't this game be a little more realistic? Why can't they stop people from shooting through 3 walls 20 metres apart and killing with me an awp? Why do grenades act like balloons and float through the air? I can't really emphasise how happy I am that a lot of what shouldn't happen has been removed and the overall quality of visuals, sound and game play has been improved. In the first month of playing I managed to rack up 200 hours of gameplay and I've started contributing back to the community with maps.	520.7

Ich habe Counter-Strike seit 1.6 gespielt und Counter-Strike: Global Offensive ist eine enorme Verbesserung. Ich stelle ein pro- und contra Liste dar:	1434.7
Viele Mitspieler, Teams und verfgbare Server.  Viele Waffen-Skins, neue Waffe, mehr Features.  Verdammt viele Workshop-Maps.  Matchmaking-System (Wobei man ein paar nderung geben msste.).  Report- und Overwatch-System. (Cheater sollten schneller gebannt werden.)  Game League (ESL, ESEA, FaceIt etc.). Bleibt erhalten wie bei 1.6 und Source.  Workbench (Waffen selber erstellen). SourceSDK (Maps selber erstellen).  Extrem gute Hitbox bei 128Tickrate-Servern.  Viele Game-Mods (Surfen, Zombie Escape/ Maps, Gungame usw.)  Mapbugs (Karten Fehler) werden relativ schnell behoben.  Statistiken sowie Trading hnlich wie bei Team Fortress 2 eingefhrt.  Valve-Anti-Cheat integriert.  Sammelkarten, Errungenschaften und Controller wird teilweise unterstrzt.	278.4
Valve schlechte gameserver.  Overwatch-System seit Jahren in der Beta.  Matchmaking-Probleme und mangelhafte Optionen. Fr mich ist Counter-Strike: Global Offensive ein richtig guter Nachfolger und natrlich diese 13,99 wert!	470.0

Inspiring video of the rise of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive;	744.9
At first I want to point out that I've owned Counter-Strike:Global Offensive since the very first day, but I have not played the other games in the Counter-Strike franchise (just CS:S for less than a year), and therefore, I do not have much experience from CS 1.6 and CS:S. When I first played the beta, I thought it was a joke, well I knew that almost all games are bad in beta, but this was complete crap. It felt like playing some weird CS:S mod, the weapons were big and clumsy, the recoil was terrible and everything was random. Anyway, I bought the game on the release day, played a few hours, the game was still crap so I actually uninstalled it to play CS:S the upcoming six months instead. One day I got really mad at the CS:S community, because every PCW you played, there would be either cheaters or players with a higher skill level searching for players in a lower skill level to have some "fun". After some raging, I scrolled through my Steam library looking for a game to play, and there is was, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, I decided to give it a try and installed the game. At first I was quite shocked, everything was different, the GUI, the maps, the weapons - everything was ALOT better, the game did actually have some feeling now and I enjoyed the game for the first time. This was the game I would continue playing every single day for two years. During these two years, CS:GO and it's community have been through alot, there have been many bugs, cheating problems, scandals within the professional scene and dumb updates, but we who still plays the game, have made it through and will continue supporting this game and Valve, and we are looking forward to the day when CS:GO will be the number one game in the world. And at last, a tip to whoever reading this, don't judge Valve's moves before you analyze the outcome. As an example, when Valve released the Arms Deal update (the update including skins, cases and keys), I still remember the reactions, some were good and positive, but some were angry and attacking. Many people stopped playing CS:GO entirely due to their thoughts that CS:GO had become a "child game" with skins and such. Well look where skins brought the game, we do now have atleast 3 major tournaments a year (more to come), ALOT of new players and a developement team who puts even more effort, in making the game as good as possible, than ever before. Thanks for reading this review, and I'm sorry if you think it was too long, and that I didn't bring up any pros and cons about the game.	435.2

Imagine, after playing a game for almost 13 years, watching it evolve, get better, finding skills to be better than the average pub player, then the ultimate version of the game comes out, it allows for competitive ranked play at the touch of the button, you practically explode with joy, and you play, and you tweak , you find the right mouse sensitivity , you learn the guns, you learn from your mistakes , you play with friends good and bad, and then you notice during a competitive ranked game that 3 members on the other team or hacking, speed hacks, hacks that dont register direct hits, even killshots can be ignored,players using programs and hardware to intentionally lag themselves back behind corners...you feel like all that hardwork you put into the game has become worthless, you feel let down by the people who brought you the only franchise you've ever put over 2000 hours of your life into, you justifably feel cheated. And thats why i can't reccomend this game, its great, it really is, but the best part of it isn't secure from the same hacks that have been used for so long, it's heartbreaking .valve you dropped the ball, please secure your servers.	2580.9

When Counter Strike: GO came out it wasn't very good, and the online servers was quite dead. But after a year of updates the game have become really good! I knew Valve and the team behind cs wouldn't let the cs fans down. Counter strike GO offers different gamemodes, improved graphics and overall options, a ranking system for those interested and a good variety of maps and weapons! The competitive scene have grown, and I think thats great. Unlike some other FPS, cs requires skill and training. When the game came out you couldn't customize the weapons very much, but now thats possible, with thousands of badass looking skins and stuff. CS:GO is really cheap compared to most competitors, so Im recommending it without doubt.	197.9

Comparing with CS:Source,we can no more spray erotic pictures in game. Instead,we have splendid weapon skins. If you become the last survivor of your team,don't be nervous,even facing 5.Just gently press your fade F,then you can guarantee everyone on your side is watching you showing off your sparkling invaluable knife. There's no noob in the world,just elegantly push your likeable F,then everything is alright. In order to keep youself brilliant,you would buy as many cases and keys as you can afford. If you don't have so much money,work for it.If you don't have so much time to work,go rob a bank. If you finally got arrested,at least you had tried your best to chase your dream and guard your faith. Go f()()() the game,and just admire your collection.

I grew up on the series. Love and hate, but it always had some magic and made me come back. When I got the opportunity to play the CS:GO closed beta it was amazing. Top notch stuff, guns had a great feel back then, no stupid stickers or skins, no failed updates. Even the final product released a year ago was good. Since the introducing of the skins, performance went to the drain (bear in mind the Source engine is 10 years old now), stability is a word of a past and the COD effect among newcomers is at an all-time high. This is not even remotely satisfying. If you find 1.6 or CSS dear, DON'T SWAP! Otherwise, you will live to regret it. You'll become a twisted shadow of your former self, incapable of gaming on that proper level ever again when you go back out of frustration. The number of cheaters and the way the support/dev team does not care about this product - makes me want to vomit. WELCOME TO COMMUNITY TESTED PAYED BETA! 7.10.14 Update: If your behinds hurt, I feel sorry for you. Focus on getting them random headshots we all get but never admit.

This game has become a great FPS in my library. I played a CS mod many, many years ago (Tactical Ops: Assualt on Terror) and loved it always wanted to play it online but never could at that time. I finally bought Global Offensive and I've been impressed everything I was expecting and much more. It's a simple FPS with different modes search and destroy, hostange rescue, TDM, and more. I will give you the warning, it's very difacult to be good at this game. The level of compitition is great. I honestly can go into a game and suck and have fun or light up the scores and still have fun. I typically play just competitive matches where it's a 30 round game first team to 16 round wins wins the match. It varies by map as to which game mode you play and in each round you only get one life. Sounds hard right? Exactly! Competitive is a blast. I highly recomend this game if you like FPS and like playing online. Use stradegy, play with friends, play with strangers and remember DO NOT PLAY THIS WITHOUT HEADPHONES IF IN PUBLIC PLACE! "The bomb has been planted is not something you want heard outloud. Just saying. My rating 9.5/10 very awesome game!	82.1
It's ok	3412.3
Counter Strike Global Offensive in itself is a good game. We are getting frequent updates from the devs and the player count keeps increase. Rather than writing a lengthy summary of my opinions of the game I have decided to break it down into two groups of bullet points. **The Good** * High skill ceiling but easy to start FPS * Lots of fun to play with friends / make new friends * Many of the guns are viable unlike previous versions * Devs connect with the community and gradually make tweaks and ingame changes after deliberation. **Needs Improvment** * Visibility (HDR / Bloom are locked down unlike prior versions). * Upgraded anti cheat (too many hackers in higher elo MM). * Movement and accuracy modifications. * Some guns need further tweaking (Deagle / P90) * Valve servers need lower VAR / higher tickrate * **Overall Rating ** 8.5 / 10	2171.3
You can buy cosmetic gun skins for $2500-5000, thus going bankrupt in the process. 11/10 would bankrupt again.	584.3
Basic Gameplay You play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice. You can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you. On the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?. Anyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode. As a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction. Being a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb. I'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here. Positive attributes : - Matchmaking - Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later) - Ranks - Cool looking skins - Fast growing population of players - Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often - Chickens - High replay value - Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring) Negative attributes : Although I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work. I REALLY wish it were longer.. And that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his "7 year old could beat you, blindfolded." - The game mode "Infernal" played on the map "de_inferno" Some people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you. It seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time. - Demolition, Also known as "jokemode" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that "4_chan" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since) Demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing! The volka Strategy You could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR you could play the game correctly like me. Here is my strategy : - Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money. - Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get. - Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can. - Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops]. - Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops. - Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job. In a whole, I do love this game And would recommend to anyone, Good half, Good half.	1058.5
What i love from this game is the fact that a single player, a weapon, a simple strategy can affect a whole round, it makes the game so unexpected and fun. Plus it have funny physics.	893.3

CS:GO is a game which was once designed around team-based attacks and defenses, something which has since been replaced by weapon reskins and recoil patterns. Pros: Very easy to hop into a casual game and enjoy a quick game. Very easy to join a competitive game and work with a team of nearly equal skill-levels in a longer game with higher tensions. New game modes to choose from. Wide variety of powerful weapons at your disposal. Betting scene. Numerous competitive leagues and teams for highly skilled players. Cons: Difficult to master weapons and recoil patterns. Luck plays a considerable role in fights. Learn a plethora of new insults from teammates. Conclusion: For 15$, it's worth every penny.	698.9

Counter Offensive - Global Strike.	1463.0
Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a great game about robbing banks. It shows how a great musical game like itself can be transformed into something of a story driven racing game. It shows a few hints of real time strategy and can be played while eating foods such as pizza, spaghetti and vegemite sandwitches. Overall i believe this dungeon crawler indie game should be given and 13/74. Cartons Of Lemons.	800.3
Counter Strike Global Offensive is a beautiful addition to the counter strike series it being the forth one to be made i believe valve have done a wonderful job but this isn't why i'm giving this game 10/10 its because You Can Also Kill Chickens For Points In Deathmatch 10/10 :D By Far My Favourite Game In The Series	1138.7

Maybe in the beginning this game was worthy. But a division of the community is running rampant with unfair play. Hacking and griefing. Every game you get paired against 1 or multiple cheaters. Last match, a bunch of weebs advertising their hack and dominating. 6/25 Lost - Matched against 5 people spaming advertising their cheat. Everything listed below, almost no registered shots. 6/25 Lost - Matched with a griefer, spawn blocking inferno T. 6/24 Win - Closet Hacker on my team (still not banned) 6/24 Lost - Closet Hacker (still not banned) All of June. I haven't had a legitimate match without some "Super RAD skript kiddies" killing any amount of fun whatsoever. Multiple of them even reasoned "$3 accounts, who cares." The only way to even the playing field is with a "you can't beat em', join em" mentality on a brand new account to indulge in 'Fun' once again while spreading malice to get them mad enough to buy the hacks to have 'Fun', and repeat in a never ending cycle. Closet hackers -No spread. *shots never spray out of a tight grouping* -ESP. Getting perfect peaks around corners, body/headshots through doors, headshots through smoke nades, perfect accuracy while blinded. (Ability to see your body through walls as if they're playing with the spectate "X-Ray" feature during the game) -Aimbot or Toggol Aimbot = Countering a rush killing off everybody rushing or Clutching an entire team. -Anti-Aim = Bullets do not register as hits on the player. Rage Mode Hackers -Mad spinning (RPM's that rival your cpu fan), Straight up BHOP into spawn and wreck your whole team (or enemy team if matched with you), all the while spam name changing and spam advertising the website hosting the cheating program @ "X" Price for "X" months licensing. I was Master Guardian 2 before this wave came in. Now I fell 2 ranks. Yes, ragemode hackers do get banned. No, alot of closet hackers play with esp & no-spread only and usually cannot be confirmed %100. Either ones you come across it doesn't matter because "$3 accounts, bro." ^this whole thing could be cleaned up/worded better. ijdgaf (EDIT) 12/28 - Couple months ago I made it into overwatch beta. During the downtime, when this game wasn't in the limelight (Oct) for a while, the case reviews against players actually cheating was about 1 in 7. Meaning , a full 60 minutes of watching 6 players who have been reported for playing well with no indication of cheating. Followed by 10 minutes of 1 player darting his reticle to enemy players through the walls throughout the game or the occasional asshat(s) body blocking an awping team mate, blocking a teammate into a corner, teamkilling/damaging a teammate to low health. When the holiday auction hiccup happened and people got free cs:go copies, that ratio went from 1:7 to 1:1. Every other case was like a throwaway account not even attempting to hide it, staring at the ground, spinning like crazy, bhopping throughout nuke, dust2, and mirage headshotting every player they came across. "Hey look at me Get  on baddie $0 accounts bro." As of late december It's 1 in 3. It's safe to say, when anything involves a flux of accounts via price or giveaway in cs:go there will be a relative flux of cheating players.	791.0
Ofc Not...one of the most expensive games to personalize...maps full of bugs...2-3 months after every steam sale a huge wave of hackers (mainly WH) invade the MM servers witch makes it impossible to play...would i buy it again?! NO NO NO...Needs better and faster anti-cheat and stop selling it like its God damn rice because the ones that have been with this game since the begining are the ones getting fed up of this wannabe FPS...DO NOT BUY better spend the money a fleshlight or something...Peace! <3	696.9
We all got here in 2012 and were like: "It's great fun but pretty rough around the edges, but I'm sure they'll fix it up and it will become a great game" They didn't fix it up. Many of the things that distinguish GO from the other games in the CS series are its worst features. The player speed, acceleration and accuracy values, plus hardly any tagging (player slowing when shot) caused the adad technique where the player strafes one way then changes direction giving him a second of accuracy where he takes some shots. What this, plus horribly broken cilent-server hitbox sync translates to ingame is spamming the strafe keys and hoping to land a shot. All this gives us a CS that values frags over brains. As I said we thought back when the game was new that all this would be polished out, it was not. Did I say horribly broken hitboxes?	1494.4
They haven't even had a real bug patch in over a year, you'd think you were playing a 10 year old game by the support it gets, not a 2 year old game that gets 5 million unique players a month and valve's "don't call us, we'll call you" policy only makes it feel worse. Did I mention the game is full of cheaters even up to the highest level of play? Kill me.	1360.8

If your looking for a game where you are shot before you walk around the corner, this is your game. If your looking for a game where sneaking is about as much worth as bouncing your head off your keyboard this is your game. If your looking to pay 13.99 for a monthly subscription to an aimbot and wallhack that VAC can't detect and don't give a crap about, this is your game. If your looking for a game where colourful decals on your gun is more important than actually playing it, this is your game. If your looking for a game where the "report a cheater" is as much use as shoving a knife in your eye this is your game. If your looking to play a game for 150 hours before realizing that its all  and uninstalling the game this is your game. Maybe you will find a legitimate game amongst all the madness but at least 75% of the time you will have at least 1 hacker on the opposite side mocking you, insulting you and laughing in your face as he shoots you through a wall as you sneak to the opposite site the objective is on. If you want an actual legit game, do not ever play this online. And no i'm not , i've been playing CS for over 10 years, this is by far the worst the game has ever been and if your considering playing this you should drive a screwdriver into your eye and save yourself the torment.	362.5
PLEASE READ BEFORE VOTING THIS DOWN I cannot recommend it because this game destroys people. It's a good game but at a terrible cost. No, Im not some anti-gaming freak, I love games. But truth said, this is a great game, but it will kill you inside. Matchmaking is well made so you usually get paired with equal to average of your team. When it's easy and you wreck havoc, it's too easy, boring, unsatisfying. If it's challenging and hard, or you're loosing, you keep worrying about your stats, skill and rank. You are either bored and dissatisfied or stressed and angry. Either at yourself or the rest of your team(that other happens more often). If you live in europe, this game will only make you racist. You will hate on every person that cannot speak english or your very own language for not being able to communicate with you, or refusing to communicate with you. Maybe at first you wont experience all that by playing casual where people usually don't care, but once you try competetive, you look at casual with disgust. The better you get, the more hateful towards other players you will be. You will not remember how bad you used to be, you will hate all the noobs, skrubs and casuals. You will judge people by their skins, weapons of choice and headshot ratio. Everyone you dislike will be labeled as cheater. Where is the fun in all this, I ask? You can be proud of yourself when you win, or survive in an action where you were meant to die, but each and every accomplishment you'll get will make you crave for more, and at one point you won't feel much from winning, but you will feel a lot from loosing.	134.4
there is no game out there that I got as much into as I got with cs:go. All started with me watching competative matches on warowl's channel. and I saw these elite players with their godlike skills and fancy new skins (the arms deal update came around). and I was like damn, I want to play like them. so I bought the game. I wasn't sucking bad because I'm a visual learner and learned most of the basics by watching the pros play. but I wanted more. I learned the spray patterns, shot a wall to learn the recoil over and over again and soon it came to the point where I surpassed all other players in casual matches with ease. the spray patterns where in my muscle memory, my reflexes with the awp improved, my nades landed where I wanted them to land and the addiction swallowed me whole. I'm going to break 1000 hours this week, I have a 300 euro inventory, a clan that get's better and better by day, a youtube channel and the best thing: endless fun. You can play gun games, awp servers, minigames, jails, hide and seeks, deathruns, aim servers, knife servers, surfs, deathmatches, demolition games and many more not considering casual and matchmaking games. And if you think you will get bored of the maps you're wrong. The maps don't create the gameplay experience, it's the players + every half a year there comes out a new operation with additional new community created maps and community created weapon skins. it costs 5 euros, but if your friend has the operation you can join his game anytime without being blocked by the game or forced to charge. CS:GO is a game that will 100 % occupy you if you're eager and competative or even if you just love community based games with a sht ton of human interactions through VoIP	1481.5

Started playing cs go because I could earn money by cases and mission drops to buy other games, but then I got hooked. Once you play a while and know how the recoil, tactics and maps work, you will have a lot of fun playing competitive and other modes. Whats better then play a game you love and get free money to buy other games.	1054.8
Do you want a fast-paced multiplayer FPS that is riddled with inconsistent crap netcode that readily bends over a barrel and presents a jasmine scented  which pooches open in anticipation for every two-bit "hacker" on the Internet? Well then THIS IS FOR YOU! Do you enjoy an endless torrent of  hackers? Teamkillers? Smurfs? Gobshites with broken microphones who will readily spout an everlasting supply of foreign swear words while you're trying to listen for the enemy? That's right, nothing adds to the challenge more than having to watch out for  and traitors on your own team! Laggy no-skill morons from far-flung lands who are impossible to hit? That's right, hit your router with a hammer and fill the ports with kitkat wrappers because YOUR HALF SECOND PING WILL SAVE YOU SON! That's called LAG COMPENSATION which gives ALMOST TOTAL INVINCIBILITY to anyone with an Internet connection that has no business whatsoever playing games like this. This was once a good game. These days KDR stands for "Kids, s and Russians". Toxicity from top to bottom. "But surely, at the higher levels, you get away from all that!" Yeah, check out the regular reports of "pro" players throwing matches for money, using hacks at top-tier tournament level, and acting like 12-year olds. Banwaves are good for about a day, if that, just to give you a glimpse of what the game could be. Don't even waste your time reporting griefers and hackers, if you want to do something more useful, open notepad, type some Russian swear words (you will know them all by now) then save the document and throw it into your Recycle Bin. Avoid at all cost. Play a man's game. Let the children have this one and buy ArmA 3 instead. Find a good, well adminned server. Ping greater than 300? *BOOM* See ya, Vlad. Mouthy teenager? *BOOM* See ya, Timmy. COMING SOON: Yet another half-baked cack-handed attempt at balancing the pistols ...	584.7
Really fantastic and balanced game! And think about the competetive aspects you could compete: - Queing up vs fullpremade teams as solo! -Getting kicked out of a ladder game just for fun for having a disconnect, even if you have 10:0 stats. -If you arent familiar with russian greetings you should inform yourself before joining a game, else you would be confused about  BLIAT VODKA VODKA, YOUR MOTHER IS A *BIEEEEP*! - Matchmaking is starting 4vs5 games, enjoy your bot! - People get random Matchmaking bans, because they can`t reconnect due to bugs! -You have to decide what player you are, you have 2 options. You can be the noob or the hacker. As Noob you basically have worse than 1,0 kd. As Hacker you are above 1,0kd, pretty simple, isnt it. -Oh and if you meet people who are Master Guardian after 20 hours playtime, dont be afraid. Its okay. The boy/girl is just playing on one of his 37 smurf accounts. I can really recommend this game if you live in russia and your IQ is below 70! Or you love the sound of ongoing 13 yo german gangster-rapper screaming in your ears, this game could be for you. If you arent sure yet if you should buy this, just check out some hacks in youtube which are available for cs:go. Its awesome. You see flying people who shoot with homing bullets through 10 walls while screaming in voicechat, YOU ARE ALL NOOBS, BUHAHAHAHAHAH. And honestly, who would want to miss something like that :) ? If the current bugs are taken serious by valve the game might leave beta stage in like 3-4 years. Buy it right now!	287.7

Do I like this game? Yes. Can I reccomend it? No. It's too hard to get into. Most new players will not gravitate towards the Competitive scene, despite it's the place where people should start, strangely. It's just not a good game to start.	56.5

Engine still broken after idk how long. Stopped playing when the buggy as hell CSS was released try to get back into it but the registry and .netcode in this version of the game is still so awful that it's nearly unplayable. The community consists of "die-hard try-hards" and people who haven't the slightest clue as to what they are doing. Ranks are useless and baseless as it falls under a W/L ratio, rather than a K/D ratio like its forefather CAL. With this release Valve continues to make money off of other people's ideas with stupid things like gun skins and lacks the originality it once had with it's release of HL1 and 2. All in all this game is a huge waste of money and does not give anything to the modding community that once made this game thrive. Forgetting the average age of a gamer and turning it's back on the people that made CS a once world renouned title.	1612.0

Simply the cake of first-person shooters. In my head CS is the purest aim-based shooter. The Counter-Strike series are an absolute classic dating back 12 years and the recipe hasn't changed very much. Why change what is not broken, and Valve realized that and made CS: Global Offensive a modernized and community-driven version of older holy grails like CS 1.6 and CS:Source. I just had to buy this game for the sake of the good old LAN-party days and the lasting effect CS 1.6 left on me. ------------------------------------------------------------------- I am very pleased with what Valve managed to do with this game. I never knew it was possible but they managed to make the game compatible with all skill levels, as opposed to something like let's say CS 1.6 in which "Get rekt" is the only game mode new players can play. What surprised me even more is the fact that they kept the classic feeling of older titles in this series. All you have to do is go into the game options and change your crosshair to "Classic" and you're set. As I expected from Valve's legendarily well-made engines, the game is running as smooth as butter on ice. The input scheme is astonishingly sharp and for good reason, since every single pixel can make the difference here. Speaking about pixels, the graphics are based on the Half-Life 2 engine and I must say, they're extremely fitting and the very, very well-made maps are the cherry on top. Nothing distracting here and definitely nothing ugly or out of place. It's a minimalist approach in my opinion and I absolutely love it! No extra filler added in, only what's needed. As a result the game is optimized as hell for high frames per second. Flawless gem polish all-around, can't really spot any imperfections. CS:GO is really balanced around the player's skill level, the player's aim and his team synergy. Match making is solid, too. There is really to complain about in this game. If you are losing it's because you suck and if you win it's because you are a mean, well-oiled clicking machine. I haven't really delved too deep into the team aspect of this game but I am really looking forward to the new "Competitive" matches. I will get there eventually, I just need to get even better than I am now, and maybe make some time to play more awesome games like this. Competition is not absent from this game, it's over-abundant for those who want to seek a challenge. You'll get it, for sure. The game modes are plenty as the maps. They include the classic Terrorists -- Counter-Terrorists paradigm and they revolve around the classic: Plant the bomb, Rescue the Hostages and many more new ones that are just a truck full of fun. More casual and more well-known game modes like Deathmatch and such are in the game if you want to shoot something fast. I am really surprised by the numerous and awesome community this game constructed, and it's constantly growing too. The players are really friendly and fun to play against from what I've seen. Good sportsmanship too. All in all, what it really comes down to is the fun aspect of this game, and boy, I must say after just a couple of matches I realized I was gonna skip the night just to play some good old CS. The game is fun and addictive once you get into it. Rounds may be short, but the replayability is ridiculously good, and it scales well with the multiplayer aspect. Man those headshots are satisfying to land. ------------------------------------------------------------------- Some tips I gave to a friend, and I'm sure these will be useful for newer players out there: "In CS, basically you have to click on the enemies head before they do, while your crosshair is minimized. Don't shoot unless you have a guaranteed headshot. For starters, I recommend switchingto one of the dynamic crosshairs in the option menu.I use classic dynamic. Now you have an idea where bullets are going. Try shooting bullets at a wall and see where they hit. Try full auto, try burst. Try practice mode here, without bots. In 98% of the situations it's good to burst or semi shoot. Never go full auto, controlling recoil is essential. You must wait a bit until your crosshair is small before shooting. Don''t forget to use Crouch/Walk (Ctrl/Shift) to minimize your crosshair. For beginners, try crouching when you see a guy and try clicking on his head. Also, never shoot while moving, your rekoil is huge and you don't have chances to hit. Don't forget to put your crosshair at head level always. Keep it up and close to corners. When enemy comes by you only have to move an inch for a headshot. Play deathmatch at first to train. What matters, in order: 1) Aim All weapons are hitscan. Aim well and use low sensitivity + a huge mouse pad. I go 28 cms per 360 degrees. 2) Reflexes You have to aim accurately and you also have to be fast in doing so. No point being able to click on the enemies head if he clicks on yours first. 3) Map awareness and predictive thinking This is basically your game skill that you've gathered through experience. Knowing how to be effective on the map. Knowing where enemies are. Listening for enemies. Knowing to take cover. Knowing when to engage. Knowing to stay with teammates. Knowing where to throw grenades." ------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall, this game is absolutely great. Can't really point anything wrong with it and I'm really looking forward to spend hundreds of hours on this one in the long run. Maybe I'll uncover some things wrong with it after I play it more, and I'll surely update this guide. Buy it. Especially if: -it's on sale -you like FPS's, especially if you've played and loved the classic ones like CS 1.6, Quake and such -you have good aim -you like a challenge and you have a competitive nature ------------------------------------------------------------------- ~~~ 9/10 ~~~ A sacred beast of a game. ------------------------------------------------------------------- "Counter-Strike is a pretty simple game.

I am going to give a few pros and cons.. Pros -Really fun to play with friends, who has mics, who you make a full team of 5 in competeive -You can meet really nice people in game -This game will still be alive for many years to come -Game is really hard to master. Why is that good you might ask? Cause you will keep playing this game for many hours just to get the basics down. Cons -There is trollers/mean crude people in the game, who are far better than you. -hackers (this is a big one later in the game of competeive play) You will come across them very often in high skilled level games. -Complainers who just gives you complete negetivity in the game. Like wow how the  did you not get the kill you ing scrub? -csgo skins (yes I have csgo skins blahaha) I am going to go with a postive review on this as a like. This is the type of a game I really like. (other than the cons) Note this will get updated if I think more stuff.	948.5

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the newest version of the well known game Counter-Strike. Global Offensive has a lot of different game modes besides of the classic bomb defusal/hostage rescue scenarios. Deathmatch, basically is about getting a lot of kills and dying as few times as possible. You will spawn at random space with your chosen weapons or random ones. In Arms Race you have to get kills with every weapon. The fastest player wins. Demolition can be a Bomb mission or hostage rescue on smaller maps compared to the regular bomb or hostage missions. Competitive is the hardest and most interesting type and is only recommended for advanced players. You have to win a minimum 16 rounds to win the game. This gamemode may take up to 90 minutes. Communication is the key here to win. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive also support ingame items, but it is a purely cosmetic thing. You will also have a chance to support the game by buying special tickets for the so-called "Operations". With an operation pass you will get access to newly released competitive maps, new weapon skins and an upgradeable medal. The graphics are much better than Counter Strike Source. The environments are more detailed and the game just looks a whole lot better. Global Offensive is one of the top 10 most played games on Steam right now, so there are plenty of players and servers. The mechanics are different from former Counter-Strike games, like the recoil for each weapon and new weapons like decoy, Molotov, etc. This could be difficulty for veteran players at the beginning. But after a while you can deal with it. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a definite buy for anyone that is into Counter-Strike. It is definitely worth the regular price of 13,99. A must have for every Steam user! Sounds 9/10 Graphics 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Atmosphere 10/10	620.8

Over 600 hours on CS:GO. Over 13 years playing CS in general. In older versions of CS if you are high skilled you can easily take down 5 low skilled players. In this version you are lucky to get onto the 3rd guy. Game is all about luck, not skill based like all previous versions of the game. Ranked up to DMG with over 200 wins in competetive and i can say this game should be released as a 5 person COOP. You should only play comp when you have 4 other friends who you know won't troll you, regardless of their skill level its better to have that than random teammates. The hit reg in this game is absolutely nothing compared to previous versions, due to the low bandwidth allocated to the gaming servers setup by valve. The skin system is nothing but a huge money grabbing scheme which no doubt has earnt a huge amount more than the game sales alone. As with all games you can trade in, this one is full of scammers. Constantly, daily trying to scam your high value items from you. Procede with extreme caution when making trades with anyone you don't know. This game promotes gambling to under 18s with the skin drop system, costing each skin a certain price with a possible return on investment. Gambling sites are regulated and usually offer around 85% return on your gambling in the long run. I believe there is no regulation of this system and there's plenty of 12yr old kids out there throwing away hundreds into this system. Alot of reviews have complained about cheaters. This isn't such a bad problem nowa days as the overwatch system has taken over VAC in the competetive section of the game, blatent cheaters are caught and banned for 1 year quite quickly and the players that support and judge in this system are to thank. Overall the game it's self has a great system but just isn't being used to its full potential. Allocate more time and money please valve.

I must recommend this game, it is my duty as one who has spent 1600 hours on CSS (from xFire) and 500+ hours on CSGO. I played non-stop competitive CS:Source in regional championships, LANs, and online leagues; and won 4 regional championships with some LAN placings. Here's what I have to say about GO... CSGO is awesome, Valve delivered here in the end. When it was released, yeah, it wasn't anything special, just a pretty CS:Source. But now we have amazing gun skins, stickers, awesome knives, intense major tournaments, souvenir packages, bracket prediction challenges, seasonal operations with extra maps and challenges for even more drops, etc. It's awesome, it's a great game to be a part of. Matchmaking and rated matchmaking based personal ELO rankings is a sweet way to keep competitive games close. It can never be perfect, but back in Source you had to wait in an IRC channel with a looped message playing until someone finally answered your loop and then it took them 20 minutes to get 5 in the server, etc. Basically with CS:Source whether you were trying to ring or you had your team it took between 20-60 minutes to get a scrim. Now it takes about 5. So, the fact that people still complain about it is beyond me. Game play wise, each CS as I know them (1.6, Source, GO) has been different beasts in terms of mechanics and recoil control. Lots of little things that made or broke you as a player in these games, but recoil control is one of the biggest. You often hear people scream deathmatch deathmatch deathmatch, that's the only way to get better. Well, quick point, how can you DM to practice when you don't know what your practicing? Best thing to do to understand the recoil patterns is load an offline game, kick the bots, and shoot at walls. Seriously. Shoot and spray at walls with various guns at various ranges with various movement patterns, that's the best way to understand how to control and use various guns. You need to understand each guns grouping patterns first before you can practice controlling them! About the community, yes, the flamers and trolls are alive and well. But here's the thing, I've been around CS a long time, I've won 4 regional championships with CS:Source, and really it never bothered me that sometimes the flamers are all you hear. Here's why. Once you play enough games (competitive or otherwise) you'll hear the same kind of person, it'll sound like this.. you guys suck, why are you even playing this game? or something similar if they are beating you. It sounds like this, you're such a hacker, it's so obvious when you beat them. The fact that people are so binary in their mentality amuses me personally, so I carry that over to CS flamers as well. Some people like to pretend they are perfect at the game, and everyone else around them is inferior, yet if you beat them you must be a hacker. It just sounds so stupid to even talk about it but seriously this is how a lot of people are about the game. Just don't let it get to you, there's no point. Don't even engage. And you wont have many problems. It's not the easiest game to pick up right off the bat. Spray at feet, get headshot is a notorious saying from outsiders about CS games, because CS can be amazingly random sometimes. And the round-by-round economy, buying guns and items every round, and recoil patterns make it a steep learning curve. But if you understand the groupings (I said how to above), read guides about strategy (like economy management, game flow), and just get in there and start playing you will see why people just can't stop playing this game! Counter-Strike was the world's original eSport. After the Championship Gaming Series went down the CS1.6 and CS:Source attention did as well, games like StarCraft and DOTA took to the forefront of competitive eSports soon after. But with the cases, skins, and major tournaments Valve and the CS community have turned CS:GO back into one of the world's premiere eSports and there's many, many reasons why it's succeeding. As I say, it's a very exciting game to be a part of right now.	529.2
It's modern version of cs 1.6 and I think its more realistic with new design of skins, walls and everything. Its really good game to play with friends. Ranking and competitive game systems are most valuable things in Global offensive. There are achievements for achieve-hunters, arms race (typical gun-game) or demolition mode - so game has everything I wanted. CS:GO settings is changing all the time, but it will only anger you, so dont care about it just play! :D Still the best multiplayer FPS. 8.5 /10 Must love that gun.	854.5

I've held this view of CSGO for quite some time, but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts. I've been playing CS for many, many years - starting in the early 2000's through to present day. This time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages, enjoying leveling my character in WC3 mods, smashing heads in deathmatch, surfing backwards, long-jumping, bhopping, played in quals for WCG, competed in CEVO and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments. I've enjoyed CS from 1.1 to 1.6, CZ, CSS and also CSGO. No, this does not make me a better player than you, and no this does not mean I know everything, it simply means that I have spent a lot of time playing different titles of Counter-Strike, have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases. There are a handful of things that really upset me with CSGO, and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after I have first played the game. These issues I consider to be game-breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play. I enjoy CS because there is a skill curve: if you want to be the best at the game, you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent - This was certainly true in all other CS games I have played, but not CSGO. CSGO feels like it is a game of luck and chance. As the game stands, it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or MM is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game. Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when jumping Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when crouching Hitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bomb Aimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag-compensated If you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick Server, this is how most events will play out: You see an enemy jump, you shoot the enemy and get no hits. You see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot, you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle. You shoot thin air, blood appears and you get a headshot kill You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his chest, you get no hit and then he crouches instantly. You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot (because he was crouching on the server) You see an enemy, shoot first, die and get no hits. Watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof. You are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb. You crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times, slowly one by one. You get no hits and die. All of these aspects of the game I consider EXTREMELY game-breaking. The fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves, "Yeah, that has happened to me on a number of occasions" just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed. In it's current state, the game rewards people for NOT AIMING - aka, "good" players in the game need only aim at the ground, run and shoot and they'll likely get a headshot, because as long as you don't aim AT the model that you see, there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit. The only one of these bugs that existed in Counter-Strike Source (pre-2010 OB update) was the hitboxes on the planting animation. An example of a bug that I do not consider game-breaking, but extremely frustrating, is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player. For some reason, after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this? A feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken, and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch? That is a huge disappointment. People standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them, but the player's screen will be completely black. This was an unintentional meta-change when trying to fix one-way smokes, and this new issue has existed for months now? The game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them. Throw a smoke down, wait until it starts to fade, teammate resmokes - rinse, repeat and run down the timer. Retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can't capitalise on the blind-criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible. What a horrible meta change. Why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago? 3D sound is non-existent in CSGO. It is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you, and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind. This game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny. I find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues, and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems. I see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other, but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable. It'd be nice if people were able to draw the dev's attention to these issues and press for a resolution.	362.4

Dear Santa, For Christmas, I would like for CS:GO to receive an AI overhaul. You see, when I play a game, and a teammate gets grumpy, they wind up leaving. That leaves me and my friends with a bot. This bot is not very bright and will often run out into anything, whether it be a smoke, an incendiary grenade, an AWP, or a five man rush of P90's and Tec-9's. At the very least, I would love for the AI to be able to sit down in a corner as though it were a chick hatching an egg everytime it was asked to "stay here team". Sincerely Kim Jung-Un P.S.

I could never really get into Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Source. But Global Offensive is really easy to pick up, is pretty polished, has nice customization option, lots of neat little things all around. It's a good MP title. I'd recommend trying to play with a friend who already knows about the game's mechanics and the metagame, too. It's a very gradual learning experience.	365.2

CS:GO is arguably the best Counter-Strike in the series. Counter-Strike's unique style in the first person shooter genre has made this series a trail blazer among many other shooters. CS:GO carries this mantra and revitalizes the concept with content that is mainly user driven. Compared to the previous iteration, some weapons have been replaced with similar counterparts while the maps have been upgraded and balanced more appropriately. Admittedly, the game was riddled with issues during the early stages but it has matured drastically since its inception, owing to Valve's diligence and community feedback. CS:GO's 250,000 concurrent players and the ever expanding competitive scene stands testimony to this game's successful approach. At the heart of this game is the community's boundless imagination full of custom maps, skins, stickers, and soundtracks that add style to the gameplay. Additionally, to show appreciation to the community, Valve packages community content into DLC and uses it to support the content creators and fund the competitive scene. This game is a must have for the FPS fans.	1804.4
In the beggining as amateur or something is good game. But after 400+ hours GO is so bad. The way you get the rank is so stupid because without pre-made team in ranked matches you are nothing. Full of random kids that flame,doing rage quits etc. So the rank doesnt show your real level. Also what about bans?If there is blackout in my home how can I avoid the ban?You have only 5 or 7 minutes to join again. And if the electricity doesnt show up then you have to be banned. 6/10	1029.4

Counter-Strike is a good game that is past its time. The recent addition of weapon skins as prize drops does not improve it as much as it cheapens the overall experience. As much fun as I've had playing Counter-Strike over the years, I now feel that new games such as Insurgency improve upon the formula and offer a similar but richer experience.	40.1

CS: GO makes my  tingle with pain. When I get a headshot I wince with a burning sensation in my testicles. I realized this game is not healthy to play, one reason being I recently installed a rop hanging from my ceiling just incase i get demoted to silver elite. My mom does not approve. Everytime I get killed I cut a little slit in my arm to hopefully teach me not to die. It has not been working and I have gone into a deep depression. I do not recemmend purchasing this game that infects you with a spite to kill yourself and other, and that creates a void that only gets filled from winning matches and getting promoted. But makes an even bigger void when you get demoted and lose. Please dont buy this game if you want a happy life free of suicidal thoughts.	749.0

This game is absolutely amazing. Takes just about everything from the original Counter-Strikes and rolls them all in to one great game while keeping the nostalgia intact. This is truly a game of skill. There is no other game like it.	2162.3
Counter Source: Global Office is a great video game to play on the internet. Personally, I like to play multiplayer more than single player. However, multiplayer is more difficult because the enemies shoot back. I think they should nerf the sniper because people can kill me in one shot even when i buy the helmet! This game is very tough but fun. I heard that the pros warm up before their matches by playing minecraft so that's what I do too.	59.4

The only thing this competitive game has that compares to call of duty is it's FPS aspect and a few of the guns. Otherwise, it's an upgrade to the original Counter Strike, 1.6, and source with a few additional game modes and better graphics. What I like about this game above it's predecessors is it's offline bots. The dedicated fans that have been playing CS for multiple years makes the online multiplayer very difficult (which is a good thing). So, what I like about this game is the offline bot mode, which allows people who buy this game to enjoy a little pwnage (or challenge when they crank up the difficulty to veteran) when they can't get it online. Also, everyone has an equal chance, not thrown off by prestiging or leveling up, which adds balance.Overall, it's a fun, challenging, and addicting game -- I'd recommend it to all gamers! Especially those who enjoy a good FPS.	455.2

Counter Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games that is kind of hard not to recommend. It's a solid shooter and it is cheap and looks really good for a game that runs on the Source engine. To new players CSGO may feel a little "back to the basics" as this game does not have aiming down the sight, unlocks, attachments, perks and killstreaks so it's heavily based on player skill and not on selecting the perfect loadout with the perfect perks. This game does have a ranking system but it's different from all the other shooters which I'll explain later on. But the game does show a lot of depth as you play more and you will find out that not everything is as straight forward as it might have looked. It's also a tactical teamplay based shooter, so don't even think about buying it if you don't like teamplay. Only a good team can lead you to victory, not a highly skilled lone wolf. CSGO offers a small variety of game modes, those are: Deathmatch, Arms race, Demolition, Classic casual and Classic competitive. For those of you who are familiar with COD Arms race is called Gun game in COD. You start off with a weapon and every time you kill someone you'll advance to the next weapon until you get a golden knife, kill someone with the golden knife and you win the game. What's rather interesting about Arms race is that you still play in teams 5v5 but the one who killed enemies with all weapons wins. Demolition is a combination between Classic (Ill explain classic later in the review) and arms race. The goal is to plant the bomb as a terrorist or defend the bombsites as a counter terrorist or defuse the bomb if its planted, there are no respawns and instead of buying a weapon you start with one and advance to the next weapon if you made any kills during the last round and if you made more than one kill you'll get extra rewards like frag grenades and flash bangs. In my opinion those game modes are fun but unnecessary because I never really feel the need to play them. There's also deathmatch which is a little different from the usual (team)deathmatch. It's played 5V5 and all weapons are available except for grenades. you play in a team but it's every man for himself as the person with the most points at the end of a round wins. What's also interesting about Deathmatch is that different weapons give a different amount of points and at some point during deathmatch certain weapons give bonus points. In my opinion deathmatch shouldn't be taken to serious, It's a good gamemode to improve your aim, and I know most new players will jump right into deathmatch but that's in my opinion not the way Counter Strike is supposed to be played. So that leaves Classic casual and Classic competitive which are almost the same gamemodes, therefore Ill use this section to talk about the things these gamemodes have in common and in the next section the differences between these gamemodes. Classic consists of the two original Counter Strike game modes: defuse mission and hostage mission. In hostage mission the counter terrorists have to kill all the terrorists or rescue one of the hostages (in the other counter strike games all the hostages have to be rescued) and the terrorists have to prevent the counter terrorists from rescuing the hostages by killing all of the counter terrorists. In defuse mission the terrorists have to plan a bomb at one of the two bombsites and make it explode or kill all the counter terrorists and the counter terrorists have to win by killing all the terrorists or by defusing the bomb if it's planted in which case killing all the terrorists does not result in victory. Both defusal mission and hostage mission have a money system. You'll receive money for all sorts of things, playing a round, of course the winning team receives more in most cases, completing a part of the objective like taking a hostage or planting the bomb and kills. The kill reward depends on the weapon, a rifle or pistol will give you 1 kill reward while an SMG (except for P90) gives you 2 kill reward, a shotgun gives 3 kill reward and a knife gives 5 kill reward while the AWP gives only 0,5 kill reward. At the start of a new round you can buy weapons and grenades with the money you earned and the money you don't spend will carry over to the next round. So now the differences between casual and competitive. In casual you play either terrorist or counter terrorist and the best team out of 15 rounds wins, in competitive the teams are swapt after the 15th round and the best team out of 30 rounds wins. In casual you'll receive more money if you lose a round, less if you win a round and the kill reward for a rifle is 150 bucks while a kill with a rifle in competitive rewards 300, the developer did it this way to balance the difference in money between the good and bad team and the good and bad players in casual. Competitive is played 5V5 and casual can be played 10V10. In competitive you have to buy your armor and your defuse kit while you get those for free in casual. In casual you can just drop in a round and leave whenever you desire while in competitive you join at the start of a game and you're not supposed to leave until the game is finished, because if you do you'll get a penalty in the form of a temporary competitive ban ranging between half an hour and 7 days and I've seen screenshots of people getting over 200 days competitive cooldown. This is both fair and unfair as it will punish the players who ragequit, the more they ragequit the longer the cooldown, but sometimes you can lose connection to the server because of server problems or internet problems in which case you'll also receive a cooldown which is highly unfair. If you play casual you'll play with random people while competitive has a ranking system based on your skill and win/lose ratio and you'll play with people of the same skill level as you. There's also a community server browser with servers that have different game rules, use community maps or even have completely different game modes. I don't spend a lot of time on community servers so I can't tell you more than this. In my opinion competitive is the way to play CSGO, I spend by far most of my time playing competitive. Casual is great for practice but keep in mind that people play different on competitive. If you're new though I advice to play a few rounds on casual before playing competitive so you can learn how the gamemode works, how the economy system works and gain some map knowledge, why should you do this in casual? Well competitive is way more serious. There's also an option to play against bots if you're new to shooters but even expert bots are pretty easy to defeat and play really different than human players. The only negative points I can come up with is that the servers have to be improved as hit detection doesn't always works as it is supposed to work, and the ranking system has to be improved. At the time of writing I am silver elite master (fifth rank) but some silver elites (fourth rank) are way better than me and some golden nova 2 players (seventh rank) are much worse. And they could crank up the difficulty of the bots as medium bots in CS:S are way harder than expert bots in CSGO making bot practice less useful. Over the last year this has definitely become my favorite shooter, I even watch CSGO E-sport. It's a crown jewel and it only costs 14 bucks. I give CSGO a 10/10. This doesn't mean the game is perfect, of course it can be improved but it's based on the fun factor, and even though I sometimes HATE this game out of pure frustration, I'll always come back to it and there are barely any games out there that can do that. Everyone who remotely likes shooters should buy it.	580.2

This is a really good, casual yet uncasual multi-player FPS that pits two teams against one another. The Terrorists and the counter-terrorists (counter strikers). The terrorists need to make it to specific bomb drop points and hold the position until the bomb goes off. The counter-strikers need to kill the terrorists need to disarm the bomb if it is set or if they kill a terrorist holding the bomb before it is set, they need to make sure no one picks up the bomb to set it. If all members of one faction die, they lose the round. There is no respawn until the next round. All rounds take place on the current map. You don't go to a different map until the match ends. Since you play a few rounds per game (let's say 15 rounds), you get cash for each round win or lose and you can spend that cash at the start of each round on weapons and stuff. So the game increases as you go from just pistols and knives in the first round to much bigger guns in the later rounds. You can also pick up a weapon off the ground and use it as well (unless you've set the rules to restrict such things). You'll keep the weapon from round to round until you die. Its a nice system. It is a great game dynamic with good maps that have the right amount of side paths and choke points to cover. The maps are small enough where there will always be some sort of action happening, but large enough where the action can happen at places you aren't. There is no single player campaign, but you can play maps on your own with bots that have difficulty levels. You can even jump into a bot if you die since there is no respawn until the next round. You'll notice the easy bots take their time to shoot you as well as you can tell watching them they intentionally don't aim directly at you. This is PERFECT FOR BEGINNERS to pick up and play, but of course the bots get more difficult. The game makes headshots instant kills and goes more along the realism path where if you jump and shoot, you're less accurate. When you kneel and shoot you're more accurate. It's a fun game that fills a different niche than Team Fortress 2. Give it a try over a free weekend and its also dirt cheap.	0.8

I got this game for 3 reasons. 1. To hear the Little Squeakers rage when your *Rekting* them. Same with the 16-21 year olds that yell "Thats ing  how did he even... Im done" 2. The lovely community this game has. There is nothing better to boost your confidence than people saying "You ing suck" "Go back to CoD" "Go back to sucking your dogs , you have nothing better to do than suck at CSGO" All of which I was doing better than they were. 3. The friends and adventure you can make during MM. You can make enemies and very good friends. Some friends will just make you play better. Like me I found a girl during a match. Now we play together and we play amazing as a team. We would fight for top Fragger. Anyways you can make good and bad memories. After all its "Not Just a Game"	465.2

When I first got this game I thought it was going to be an amazing anime RPG. I turned on the game and I was so excited. For whatever weird reason, it wouldn't let me customize my character. "Whatever..." I thought and joined a server thinking maybe it would show up. When I joined the server no character customization was to be found. Nor a tutorial. Nor was Naruto, Pikachu, or Ash. I then decided I would ask the "helpful community". Unfortunately for me, I was globally offended when I asked people where Naruto was. People immediately told me to kill myself over the mic. This drove me into a deep depression, I couldn't watch Dragon Ball Z or Seinfeld again. D: -69/10 Would not cut myself from the suicide messages again	243.4

Global Offensive began development in early 2010, and while details on all stages of the game's production remain scarce, it's more or less known that it was heavily troubled by design conflicts, clashes with the community's desires, and not even developed in-house at Valve (passed off to at least two other Seattle-based development studios, with Hidden Path Entertainment fully developing the game until release). It was touted as a reinvention of Counter-Strike in general, aimed towards new players and especially, console audiences (one year and a half after release, both console releases have become entirely redundant) and featuring new, community-designed game modes (two Gun Game-inspired modes under the umbrella "Arsenal Mode", which has now been all but abandoned by Valve). While the game was in a disastrous state at the beta's launch in December of 2011, its premature release in August of 2012 did offer a much improved experience... but it still simply wasn't ready for release. The console versions themselves were poorly made, and the main PC version offered few features, few maps and an overall lacking gameplay component, especially on the competitive side. Now, close to December of 2013, two years after the game first materialized as a closed beta, it's safe to say that after a full year and a half since its Steam release, with consistent, robust and uncompromising post-release development by Valve, CS:GO is a completely different product. With the makings of a balanced monetization platform in the Arms Deal systems (paving the way for a possible free-to-play re-release), huge new additions in gameplay and graphics alike, and a renewed and refreshing focus on the competitive side of the game (both in-game and out of game, in some of the many prominent LAN tournaments), CS:GO has reached a point where it's clear that it has become equal, if not superior to CS 1.6... and make no mistake, this could be only the beginning for the game. There is still much room for improvement - certain aspects of gameplay which hamper the experience for both casual and hardcore players (aimpunch, weapon balancing, and the lack of proper tutorials or any reliable way of explaining deeper mechanics); the lack of content outside of the main "Classic" game mode and the lack of support for the nigh-deprecated "Arsenal" game modes (honestly, a control point or holdout or VIP mode could go a long way towards giving players more to do). I also feel a broader selection of weapons (both base weapons in the buy menu and sidegrade loadout weapons) and equipment could freshen up a static and rigid gameplay formula (which in Dota 2, for instance, changes radically every six months). For the most part, however, this is Counter-Strike, as deep and skill-based as it's ever been but with adjustments and improvements which help it feel more modern and dynamic, without compromising its core gameplay mechanics. If they play their cards right, CS:GO could end up being greater and more expansive than either of Valve's previous multi-year, post-release and free-to-play game experiences (DOTA 2 and TF2). Either way, now's the time to get on board; and for the mandatory horrendous pun for my closer: now's the time to go, go, go!	1029.6

The best Counter-Strike iteration yet. A lot of updates, steam workshop, competitive mode, competitions, skins and constant content. A good way to make steam wallet money by trading or selling stuff in market. None of the games you will play will have the fluidity of a valve game and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive sets the standard. 10/10	1196.7
The Ultimate FPS shooter. If you are an FPS fan this is the game for you. High skill, fast paced rounds, intense gun battles. If you are one of the few people on steam who don't have this game, I highly suggest you add this to your collection.	1106.2

Best chicken designs and animations. 10/10	913.6
It is kind of hard to say I do not like the game after > 1100 hours of gameplay. It is very addictive! What I love about the game is the fact that skill matters and that every player, from total noob to pro-level, has the same arsenal of guns to use. You can not get better guns or upgrades by investing money, meaning it is skill, experience and teamwork (and connection) that makes the difference. But you can give your guns a personal touch, by getting different skins, adding a personal name to a weapon and add stickers. I really like the bomb defusal mode (or bomb placement when you are a terrorist), but there are also other game types: Hostage rescue, Armsrace , Deathmatch and Demolition. Also there is a big library with player made map, all with their own rules and styles. (aim training, headshots only, all vs all, achievement maps, platformstyle and surfmaps) This is my first ever FPS, so needed the first 1k hours (i am a very slow student) to learn how to hold a gun, how to recognize enemies and friends, learn game mechanics and map based tactics and to work well in a team, etc. The overall crappy community is not making it easy to learn the game, because specially as a starting player you get kicked out of matches all the time. Hey I am silver 1 (lowest competative ranking) , of course I am not a star player! Many other players on that same level are hacking, have second accounts, or are experienced in other shooters. And their patience level with newcomers is about 0. So a mistake (even if i had no clue i made one) resulted often in an insta kick. Most absurt thing was getting kicked out of a casual match for being noob...omg really?:) If you can't practice in a competative match, and get kicked out of casual matches too...then how on earth can you learn how to play? Despite an overall crappy community, I met some awesome people. Lot of fun to play together, preferably in a full team, or just some casual matches, armsrace, deathmatch or training. And training does pay off! Anyway, you would think that by now I am a pro, but hell no! I guess I have to conclude I am not talented enough to get to a high rank. On the bright side....I do not get kicked out of a team anymore, at least not that often....must be doing something good! Still playing daily, and still loving it! So... recommended? Hell yeh! NB I just have to mention that that laguage used ingame is really bad... Maybe thats just my feminine view., but I think it extremely childish and limited to the same scolding words over and over. Quite pathetic to be honest. I learned to ignore it. Loving the mute button! I just hope that it is not a reflection of those people irl. That would be really sad.	1396.8

Pretty good game overall. If you're bad at FPS's or you aren't very good at aiming, I don't recommend playing because you'll most likely be called an "Autistic " by "pros". Then next round they get knifed and you can't help but laugh at that . 9/10	51.6

a good game of the Counter Strike Series if you played CS:S you will love this game too they brought in some new modes including a regular Death Match Skins for Weapons available in store / Steam Community Market and a great new weapon selection screen for the rest the game is pretty much still the same as CS:S ,just with more Quality and added stuff Recommend this game for any FPS fan and CS:S player , if you havent played one of those before , its still a great game to try out AT - 02-02-2014 , 14:56 , GMT+1	6.2
Do not buy this game. Sorry for anyone who likes this quickly thrown together peice of  but in my personal opinion it's a crap. 75% of your deaths will not make sence meaning wallbang through none penetrable walls, cross map no scopes through solid objects, enemys constantly knowing your location, spraying down enemys at extremely close range 50% of the time dosent kill them no matter if you unload a mag or not, Shotguns do not kill at point blank but snipers instant kill you on a leg or toe shot, Feels like the game is on constant headshots only with most weapons. I appologies for i sincerly HATE this game and i do not recommend it to anyone nor to my worst enemys. It's torture.	11.9
Don't...even...bother... not picking up this game! This game has changed my life completely. I'm now sober (6 months! I know, still keeping my fingers crossed, because of my relapse last year), and I'm also off Heroin. Last year was a difficult year for me, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer, something about the way I rest my laptop on my left testicle that managed to cause internal bleeding. Ever since I picked up CS:Go a few months ago, I've stopped resting my laptop on my testicles, instead I've been resting my testicles on my laptop. I thank the developers of this game for creating a masterpiece, and creating a beacon of hope for when I needed it the most.

arms race is just a camping game, casual is full of bronies and furries. the only thing that i would recommend is competitive with friends. Even if you guys are getting stomped you'll still have a few laughable moments, not for everyone but still a must get if it's on sale or something	239.1
When I first saw this game, then I thought that this game is going to suck. Oh how I was wrong. I really enjoy playing this game. I like the fact, that there are some new weapons and that you can purchase skins for all weapons. The new buy menu however is quite unfamiliar, but I guess that's a thing I must get used to. Call me old-fashioned, but in my opinion, 1.6 is still better! ==)	656.9

CS:GO mixes up Source and CS 1.6 gameplay. The recoil and the flashbangs are more 1.6 like and the rest is pretty much Source. In CS you have no aim-down-sights-feature what means that you have to control your fire by shooting short salves or single shots. You can also learn the gun's spraypatterns by holding down fire-key and noticing the bullet-impacts (on distance they aren't really noticable but on short to middle ranges it works pretty well). In long range firefights people mostly strafe left and right, shoot single shots and try to hit their opponents head (unrealistic.. but interessting and challenging). You can duck pretty fast but it has almost no effect on your precision. You will be slow and more vulnerable. Flanking is hard in this game, because there is no sprint and maps are designed to have clear, mostly open ways. You can hide in only very very few situations because mostly you have great visibility (It's a bit bad and sometimes irritating that you can not disable blood decals). Mostly the only cover you can get is behind corners or of course headglitch-positions. In this game you can not go phrone or lean around corners. I think leaning would be a nice addition but no.. this game is still remains classic. Armor is more helpful than it was in Source. To me it feels like it's more important to land headshots. Because of that it's rather unlikely to get wallbang-kills. It's hard to spray, there is not much hit-slowdown and armor is very powerful.. and sometimes wallbanging feels a bit random. The sound in this game is good. You mostly hear exactly when people run, shoot or jump. You can mostly locate loud players really precisely (unlike in most modern games, where you mostly have crazy boominess or randomized sound.. because of perks for example). Counter-Strike is mostly comprehensible. Some maps got a really nice overhaul (dust2, dust1, aztec, office, militia, mirage).. Train and Cobble are very different compared to Source or 1.6. Personally I don't like them that much.. Inferno is very similar to the Source-version (they only changed some wall textures and made some minor changes). It's good that Valve changed the hostage rescue mode. Now it's more tactical and more objective based, but I think this mode doesn't work that good with the old map layouts. It's sad that there are only very few new competetive maps. Instead of new official maps there are buyable community-mappacks which are available in competetive and causal matchmaking for a period of time. The ability to find or buy weapon-skins is new in CS:GO. On the one hand it is cool to have camos on your guns, on the other hand it's bad that you mostly find bad looking and/or bad quality skins (or cases). Most camos look very colourful and not realistic. If you want good looking skins you most likely end up buying the skins for real money (on the steam marketplace). Conclusion: CS:GO is a new CS with mediocore graphics (the textures are mostly 512x512 pixels and could be better, sometimes the bloom- and post-process-effects are a bit annoying and also some animations could be better), reworked maps, new recoil and still not perfectly balanced guns (but it's fine). It has most things that the old CS-games already had but also some new things. There is ranked matchmaking, a great HUD and an easy to use replay-function. It's also very nice that you still have dedicated servers. You have the possibility to make your own maps and use server-mods. These are all great features that every modern FPS game should have. If you want to customize the look of your guns, you will have to pay for it. It's very very unlikely to find good skins and the amount of skin-drops is limited to 2-8 drops per week. All in all I think CS:GO is a game that continiues the series in a moderate way. It could be better but it could also be a lot worse. Since this game is not too expensive I can recommend you getting this game.	969.6

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive truly is a game like no other. In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, you are tasked with globally offending as many people as you possibly can in 30 rounds, with an array of tools such as mic spam, teamkilling, or racist bullet messages. It differs from the original Counter-Strike (Known as '1.6' because there are 1.6 people still playing) in the fact that it's not 37 years old. Counter-Strike Hardline refines the tried and true formula of Police (Voiced by Nolan North) vs Counter-Police (Voiced by Troy Baker), bringing in many new faces to each team, such as Jewish Toad from Super Mario Bros, a black guy, a ghost with a beret, and a hot topic customer. Counter-Strike: Black Ops adds exactly 3 new zones for you to wreak havoc in, bringing the total amount of maps to 1, but makes up for it with a large arsenal of over 70 weapons, which I will now list for you. -Ak-47 -M4 -AWP All in all, Counter-Strike: Global Defensive is a robust top down open world third person beat 'em up that tweaks the gunplay to its best, with amazing graphics and sound design, it's bound to keep you hooked until Counter-Strike 5. 0/5	287.2

I am pretty new to PC FPS, I use to play COD on XBox but after quitting Xbox to play PC. I have gotten into this game alot more now. I Enjoy the gameplay and how its alot more fair. There are no hacks I have come across and the only thing bad is how much some of the market items cost. Seriously who the  spends 250 on a cosmetic item, who even has 250 in their steam wallet?	14.8
It's CS, of course it's good. :3	6.3
So i gave a thought for long time about what i'm going to write down on this review since it's one of my favourite games on steam.	828.2
So far i can tell that the gameplay really makes fun especially the gungame , deathmatch mode and the normal casual stuff. Developers definetly achieved to create a varied and half way balanced game elements in this fps game. they still do some updates and make some changes by and then just to appear it more interesting.  From the point of technical aspects they succed so far ( at least in my opinion ) , because all different weapons can be used for certain situation so there aren't many weapons which are superior to others, in addition you can balance this by teamwork and strategic actions. Yes this game is not only about skill, it's more relying on teamwork , which is also an interesting fact about this game, because high skill doesn't mean anything to this game.	757.0
For the	1248.1
i can give a	376.8
, because it bonds a lot of fun and variation for players.  In contrast for the	1015.1
, unfortunatly i	273.8
. You sure ask why. The reason is the community itself, it's poisoned with pathetic low self-esteem people who create smurf accounts in order to hack and ruin the game, and as if it's not enough they also insult for no reason . they probably do it to strenghten their self-esteem or maybe they need mental help i don't know , somehow or other it's really bad. Almost every match i only read on the chat " look on my main account im *insert here high rank*" . so if this is the case why are they even owning a second account then? and making hacks appear so obvious?! i really don't know. And before people come to me and to label me as a low player, my highest rank so far was master guardian elite, but i don't care about such stuff, it just ruins my mood to encounter obvious frauds who also try to insult you via mic or chat just because they don't have got any balls in real life. that's why it is so pathetic. In addition some random players in your team also do some mistakes on purpose to ruin your day more. i mean i play this game to get rid of my stress and all i get in return is only more stress. i wouldn't even care if i would lose all the time, when i could be sure that they aren't hacking or insulting each other like 10 years old kids. It's also a sad fact that people think big of them by hacking and can't even speak a single word in english, like if they are some uneducated people or anything.  i will still play this game, probably because i still have faith in humanity, but so far i only got disappointed.	40.4
Matchmaking sucks. People quit way to often. Never put with a full english speaking team. Always got someone crying for a weapon drop. Always one  chasing chickens. The community is filled with 8 year old CoD fanboys. Even if your the best, your a noob. End up spending way to much money on skins that don't mater. SO yeah, 15/10 best game I ever played.	602.8

I don't really know why Global Offensive costs less than Source, but nevertheless, this is a great game, the successor of a real legend. It's a little hard to adapt if you come from games like Battlefield or CoD because of the recoil and no sights, but if you are dedicated, you can master it in no time. If you are a fan of shooters, you MUST play this game... but warning: it'll be addicting as hell.	841.5
Very nice game. Recommend to all the CS fans. ~ 9\10 ~	798.9

Well, this game is amazing, and is very different from the past Counter Strikes. Graphics have improved alot, which I believe why many people love games because of their graphics. (Graphics aren't everything). As of the past Counter strikes, you would have to find a server with the particular gamemode that you want. (Arms race, Deathmatch etc etc) In CS-GO You wont have to worry about that, they have different gamemodes where you could actually choose to play in besides finding a server that has it. I have also notice that this is fairly alittle bit easier than any of the other counter strikes, probably since they reduce the recoil a bit? But either way, tap firing is always the key. Also many Unique Features they have added in this game. First off, there are the skins. Many people disliked this idea since they probably thought CS-GO would be "like" Call Of Duty. Well, adding skins doesn't really mean anything, it just makes you be able to battle in style. Not to also mention offline mode. Offline mode is basically playing with bots. Now, some Counter-Strikes did have bots such as Counter Strike Source, but I just thought it was nice that they would add "bots mode" back. Counter Strike Global Offensive is way different from any other FPS (First Person Shooter). It's much harder and takes a bunch of skills seeing the fact that many players are already pros. So, that's why I play Offline mode. If I were to rate this game out of 10, I'll probably give it a 7.5/10	410.5

This game is so uguu. I play with my friends its full of ha-to and burning passion of nakama. I like when I get the gun and I shoot with much incredible sniper action. The p90 is also the most kawaiiest gun I have ever seen and it makes my mune go kyuuuun. I highly recommend this for tomodachitachis and oniichans that want to have the most tanosi time together with incredible feeling building within nakama. Highly recommend to buy 'kawaii killer' sticker and dress up your guns like idolmaster game.	828.2

I was going through the map, and was trying to find and kill the remaining Counter Terrorists, I No scopped a guy, which he fastly replied with: HACKER, HACKER OMG OMGGG.. Then another Counter Terrorist heard the gunfire and came to see what's going on, I camped the way through, and Body shotted him. I picked up an AK 47 That was on ground. I killed the remaining Counter Terrorists with the AK 47 That I found on ground. This was one of the best experiences that I will never forget. Rate: 15/10	270.6

It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory. You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own. Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fuck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP. You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b. Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods. You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'. You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.	936.2
Revan was only 23 years old. He loved CS:GO so much. He had most of the achievements and items. He prayed to Gaben every night before bed, thanking him for the inventory he's been given. "CS:GO is love," he says, "CS:GO is life." His elder Dragon hears him and calls him a silver scrublord. He knows his elder is just jealous of his son's devotion to Gabe. He calls him a console peasant. He slaps him and sends him to sleep. He's crying now and his face hurts. He lays in bed, and it's really cold. He feels a warmth moving towards him. He looks up. It's Gabe! He's so happy, Gabe whispers into Revan's ear, "Try your chances... Open a case." Gaben grabs Revan with his powerful dev-team hands and puts him on his hands and knees. He's ready. Revan opens his pockets for Gabe. Gabe puts his hands deep into Revan's pockets. It costs so much, but Revan does it for CS:GO. Revan can feel his wallet emptying as his eyes start to water. He accepts the terms and conditions. Revan wants to please Gabe. Gaben lets out a mighty roar as he fills Revan's computer with keys. Revan opens all the cases and gets nothing worth anything at all.	2837.1

It is an improved Counter-Strike over Source, but there are a large number of problems. Getting kicked out of competitive or leaving in the middle of the round can result in a time-out, accuracy problems, hardware problems and more. However it is still Counter-Strike from deep within, and I like playing it. It just needs to be a little bit reworked.	832.4
Great game, until you start playing it for real. In competetive you run into people who are many ranks higher than yourself, or people who got another steam account, then bought the game again, in order to kill nubblets. It is also not too rare to run into hackers or people that should not of been placed in the rank they currently are. Then in casual, the same thing happens. This games matchmaking is horrid and needs a complete revamp.	762.1
Melodram Patheticism	870.0
I love all Counter-Stirkes, this one is pretty good. Personaly there are so many mechanical flaws that desrupt the whole game all together. This game can become rage inducing to certain extents. One notable flaw is the poor lag compensation and certain match making glitches for Competitive Mode. For the past 2 weeks, this game has been brutal with high pings on every single server I join. I'm getting banned for weeks just for having a poweroutage; some teamates accidentally either walk infront of you fireing a weapon a few times or walking into a HE grenade; and you get a ban/kick for their own fault. I enjoy this game at very few times, but not enough to be worth what it is. I regret buying this game.	467.7
Blue things with white hats, blue things with white hats everywhere.	248.7
I'll just be straight-forward with this; this game is for ones who enjoy FPS, Counter-Strike games, and PvP. If you are one that doesnt enjoy those things then this game isn't for you. You will be faced with a lot of frustration and will regret purchasing this game. Now for those that do enjoy those things stated before, this game has better graphics than the previous CS games, intense competitive FPS matches, remakes of nostaligic classic CS maps, and new fun casual game modes like arms race. So yes, I will recommend this game, for those that love FPS.	336.8
Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.	1307.3
Once again, Valve never fails to deliver an epic title such as Counter Strike. For years, the Counter Strike community was divided into two titles: Counter Strike: 1.6 and Counter Strike: Source. But now thanks to Valve's latest Counter Strike adition, we can finally bring back the family all together. The addition of skins are all bonuses that make Counter Strike: Global Offensive even more enjoyable, following Team Fortress 2's hat and drop system. The money being used for E-sports for the best to take place in. The competitive rank system that finally matches players equally based in terms of skill and tactic, as well as giving you the prestige for winning. The game is not perfect, but then again no game is. But what seperates most games from this one is the fact that the beloved developers of Hidden Path Entertainment are always listening to the fans while working together with the top players to try to achieve the perfect gameplay (although there are many features that could be similar to DOTA 2 to make it even better, but Valve will learn soon). Thanks to this game more and more people are joining the community of this game and we should all work so that this game, or should I say franchise becomes the best First Person Shooter series EVER!	1184.8

I really want to recommend this game. It's a more immersive shooter than any of the Call of Duty series, and the way the game is made requires logical thinking and tactical strategies to win rounds with your teammates. When the game goes well, it's buckets of fun. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to newcomers. There are many reasons for this. First of all, unless you plan to mill around in deathmatch or the other lesser-played game modes (so anything but casual/competitive), you're going to die, a lot. And then you wait. You watch your uncooperative anonymous Russian teammates slowly break apart and lose the rounds in the most ludicrious fashion. If you can stand the game long enough to become half decent at it, you may find that you can often shoot someone in the head, literally tracing the bullet into their cranium, only to see that it doesn't register the hit due to the sub-standard 64 tickrate matchmaking servers and/or your West Country internet connection, thus falling victim to yet another unfair situation. If your internet connection is not the problem, you may try using ESEA or Faceit to play your competitive matches with. So you can pay more to play the game for no benefit other than to escape the crap quality of the standard servers, or faff about on Faceit, waiting for the afk team captains to pick maps, or the other team to cower away during the initial deciding knife round. After a few bad experiences, I've decided that Faceit isn't worth the hassle. Playing competitive also puts you in danger of not only numerous wallhackers, but mainly these things called smurfs. Put the image of the little happy blue creature out of your head: these are the players with a high rank on their first steam account, then make second/third/fourth accounts to play against easier opponents. It's that simple, yet it's infuriating and game-destroying for us lower ranked players. And when you discover this in a competitive game, your only choices are to stay there and endure it, gradually losing your sanity, or take a competitive ban. If you're lucky enough to have decent friends, they may just kick you from the game, sparing you of either choice. Having played almost 3 solid week's worth of the game in total, I have accumulated a wide friend group who also shares my pain, but we still play together for the social side. This is when I can recommend the game: when you've already played a lot of CS:GO and have many friends that also play the game. If you're new, and have less patience than a special forces marksman, you're going to hate this game. I hope that if you decide to play this game, you can take my advice with a pinch of salt, as I am admittedly easily riled up in the heat of the moment. However, if you too go ape, you only have yourself to blame. Also, look out for skin collecting. I've been caught by it, it saps a lot of your money, and is literally an addiction. Not a good one like being immersed in a fandom or crack cocaine: one that's ultimately utterly pointless.	692.1

CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet. Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC. If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game, with the following special bits:	320.2

I used to be an Xbox addict. But after playing this game, I have now stopped playing xbox for months. After all the years of playing COD i have finally figured out why I never had a girl friend. I was alone, played alone, lived alone, I thought it would never end... Then my friends told me about steam and after a while I found this game, Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I was excited to play it, i played it everyday NONSTOP until i felt like going to sleep. One day, I woke up and of course started playing cs go, I noticed what i have became...a csgo addict. I didn't know what to do when i was thinking of that. I quickly shut off my computer and went outside for once. I thought about what i was thinking...I decided to go back inside, still trying to get it out of my head..."a csgo addict". I started crying...I didn't know what to do. I couldn't stop playing now...I have only just begun. I looked at all the money i had left and wasted it on cs go skins. The addiction is growing. I couldn't stop it even if a tried, thats when i realized...that i have fully became a cs go addict. To this day, I'm still a cs go addict. I love cs go and will never stop playing it... 10/10 Ruined my life that i never had...	2415.8
Just started playing this game. I have found it to be fun to play. I allways see alot of players using this game so feel it is very interesting for user to play.	1.3
Very poorly made game, no scorestreaks, no aim down sights, bullets dont go where you aim. Plot clearly stolen from Spelunky. Only buy if you're a diehard fan of the Dragon Age series.	1183.5

Teamwork and skill are the standouts that gap this shooter from many others. improves on previous CS editions with imporved mechannics and alot of balancing along with micro-purchases. this game is highly addicting with a strong emphasis on co-operation and and mental strengh teamed with aim and many other factors. with the goods there are still problems; the biggest being the community, with many people hacking or generally being a pain in the . I highly recommend this game for anyone that loves shooters and competive games.	964.2

No... just no. I love this game, it's really good, but I'm giving it a thumbs down. Not just is the matchmaking system broken and the community is full of russians and 10 year olds, there are countless cheater and smurfers. Oh, you wanted to play a game without constant unbalance, and wallhacking jerks? Well, you're in the wrong place. The community is toxic, wanting to kick you because you decide to save or make one single mistake. When you ask to get kicked for having to go or whatnot, nobody gives a , and you're doomed with your ban. Make ONE small mistake like accidentically flicking your mouse and boom, kicked. The smurfers are stealing kills and ruining the game, everytime I play with one I'm just planting the bomb while he gets aces and if I'm lucky I get to kill one player per second round or so. When there's a hacker on my team and I insist to kick him, my teammates give two  and won't kick him for the sake of winning. Also, VAC and overwatch ing sucks. I see hackers everyday, and VAC takes it sweet  time and lets them ruin the game for as many players as possible before they get banned, on which they create a new account to continue cheating. Don't even let me begin with knives, ing $300 for a knife? I do agree in the skins looking cool and all that but seriously, why not spend that money on upgrading your computer so you can admire your knives in better quality? And the case unboxing is ridiculous, I cannot count how many Negevs I have gotten from spending $50 on cases. On top of that, the matchmaking always puts me with 12 year olds. I'm sick of kids saying "k yau bish" in the worst accent possible. The workshop is also horrible, there's nothing but AWPs, AKs and M4s. Most skins doesn't even have a purple variant, and I honestly don't see why there are 6 covert AWPs and 0 covert Mac10s. Overall? +Great gameplay +Nice graphics and performace +Interesting game modes -Toxic community -Constant smurfers & hackers -Unstable matchmaking -Ridiculous anticheat system 4/10. I'm going back to TF2, at least people are mature there and hacking is pointless.	689.6

I had so many plans for this summer. I wanted to learn to play DOTA 2. I wanted to learn CSS. I wanted to get myself hard at work saving for a car and some more parts I need. Then my friends asked me to play a couple rounds of CS:GO with them. Told them I was rusty, having not played since the year before, but I'd try. I've played 75 hours in the past two weeks. I've gained 15 pounds. I smell horrible. I've slept a total of 2 hours in the past two days. 10/10 do recommend.	704.2
Matchmaking in this game is literally the most terrible thing i've ever stepped into. Just trying to rank up is literally impossible seeing the people that actually play this game either greif, hack, or flame. And it's pretty common to start a game with a useless bot because people don't know how to manage their time. It's about 1/5 chances you will be put in a good PUG and not only that, the game is infested with hackers. Every holiday the game goes on sale for basically pocket change and hackers just ruin the game. Good luck getting in a game with people who actually have common sense.	941.9

In my opinion, this game is still very young and undeveloped and all the hate against russians is stupid. I mean i'm not one to talk here i hate them sometimes aswell. I realised something when i was playing one day, the game has gone trough a lot of changes and that it was slowly turning into a moba like game, where rank is more importand than having fun. How valve changed CS for me made me yonder and ponder from the time when i was playing CS 1.6 or CSS. Back then there where no rankings nor matchmaking and the servers where flooded with ads. I really hate how people neglect the times when people were fun to play with. Now people only care about how big your rank is, and how expensive your skins are. Where are the good old times? To me this game is a mess because of the ranking system and i mustn't recommend it for players from CS 1.6 OR CSS. Sure there are different mods, but people mostly play competitive and try to force their rank down your throat.	505.1
'Hey, Caroline, your phone is ringing!" Then let it ring. "But your friend is calling." I don't care. "Caroline..." I'm trying to blow up some boxes in the middle of nowhere here. "Pause your game, and call him back." No. "Caroline..." I'll just call him later! "Call him back now." Why? "Because he called you!" But I don't want to talk to him at the moment. "Then what do you want to do?" Blow up boxes in the middle of nowhere. "Why are you even playing that game?" ez skins ez life "What?" Easy skins, easy life. "What does that even mean?" I apply foreskin to my weapons, and make my life easier. "Jesus Christ." Besides, my irl friends play the game too, they'll just talk to me trough steam. "What if it was important?"	1384.8

I love Counter-Strike serie, its one of my favourite series of all time, CSS is best game of CS-serie, it have zombie, jailbreak, etc... But this.... this game is ed up in my opinion, too many cheaters and kids in servers who troll and scream to chat... it make my ears bleeding! And when the CS:GO was in sale it was last mistake... there is over 150k players who can't even play... And hackers do milliion accounts and buy it and hacks... This game is actually unplayable now... And the all skins, cases... this game reminds of Team Fortress 2... Its unplayable too.. I dont know what is problem with valve... They want only money probably they dont care about fans... what we want... They care just about money now... So i dont recommended this game to anyone... first it was good... now its horrible...	90.0

Best shooting game for me ever. A lot of hackers, but you are able to choose to play in certain time to avoid them. Mostly they are high ranks in competitive mode. Casual, Demolition, Arms Race, Deathmatch mode and workshop maps are fun. Be patient, well teamwork, good in hearing, accurate aim skills and game sense are the keys to be pro in this game. Practice make Perfect !	924.9

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter and the next generation of Counter-Strike running on updated Source Engine and has many new features added. The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. This means slightly less weapons recoil and no need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further. Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system. Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving. You either die as a noob or live long enough the get a title hacker. This is yet the best Counter-Strike game where casual and hardcore gamers can play. I recommend this. Rating 9/10	229.7

This game is probably better than Half Life 3. Watching Fnatic forfeit Dreamhack is a more satisfying ending than finishing the story for the Half Life seires.

I honestly do not like this game at all. This is my personal preference, I do not enjoy the round-based gameplay, I very much prefer jumping into a game and enjoying a no holds barred gorefest. But for all the readers out there, I'm throwing away my bias when it comes to reviewing this game! THE GOOD: The graphics for this game are very pretty. The game and everything (or mostly everything) in it has been polished greatly since the last rendition While I don't like the competitive gamemode (or casual, for that matter), I CAN acknowledge that when I DID play the game, I did feel that this gamemode really did capture the charm and tension that the other Counter-Strike games gave off. Deathmatch and Arms Race can be quite fun, using most of the Counter-Strike mechanics without the round-based gameplay that the rest of the game is so popular for THE BAD: The way the skins work make no sense. I can't understand how two people would get the same skin on the same gun, only to have one get factory new and the other battle-scarred. Personally, I feel the skins would make much more sense they would drop as factory new and deteriorate over time. Granted, it'll never work now, as it would definitely ruin the economy... The spawns in Deathmatch/Arms Race are horrible. while they've been improved over the months, I would still have an occasional issue where I'd kill one guy, only to have them respawn close by and shoot me down moments later. OVERALL: While I don't enjoy round-based gameplay, and the deathmatch spawns are too shoddy for me to truly enjoy it, I'd still really recommend the competitive gamemode to those who are really interested in that kind of thing. This game has a HUGE playerbase, so you'll never be left waiting for hours for a game! While this review gives off most of what I wanted to get across, I also wrote a slightly more detailed version over on my blog.

The third game of the famous Counter-Strike franchise. The graphics in CS:GO are amazing , as well as the gameplay. This version includes more gamemode to play , weapon drops and weapon skinning (making weapon skins for Valve to add by submiting them on CS:GO's workshop.), its also a good way to make some profit for your Steam Wallet. You can do that by simply playing and selling your drops on the Steam Community Market. However if you plan on quiting durring a competetive match , its not recommended. You'll be given a few bans and after that every single quit will lead up to a 7 Day ban. CS:GO is like Counter-Strike combined with Team Fortress 2. It's a title that deserves the money. TL;DR I've invested too much to fall back now.	483.0

Every-time this game goes on sale something inside of me dies. Thinking ( Here comes more hackers and smurfs ) 494,368 in game right now which is the highest peak it ever reached until now. EDIT : Now its 595,439 Anyway Csgo is a great game. I mean if you don't know any of the counter-strike series thats really bad because you have to, it is the basic fps game out there. In csgo it is even more fun and much more in-depth than Counterstrike:source. More modes more maps, and matchmaking systems and customize-able skins. I'v had a few people who don't know it thinking you buy better weapons with money. Nope all players same weapons just different colors ( Skins ) Thats all But the sad part of the game is having a lot of hackers, everytime it goes on sale = more and more hackers. Well that said you can play a lot of games without encountering one and just having some fair maps. But at ( Competitive ) mode you are most likely to encounter more hackers than you can count because thats the ranked mode in the game. Anyway, My favorite Fps on steam, I Loved Source so much but after getting into Global offensive i dont see myself trying source ever again. Also in this game you get weapon drops after finishing maps ( Random drops ) so you can trade/sell on market and gain some money, I got about 89$ from selling those stuff. good for people who wants to waste all their time on an FPS and still get something out of it.	132.9

So Counter Strike Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest revision of the long running Half-Life mod fps. Created by Hidden Path the game is more of a refinement towards modern day military shooters then previous instalments such cs 1.6, cscz and css. This is mainly to allow a more broaden appeal to the masses of COD and Battlefield generation. You see CS generally has always had a very hardcore user base that is highly skilled. You'd be lucky to find yourself top of your first few games as a beginner like you could do in the fore-mentioned rival franchises in competitive multiplayer. How have they achieved this and to what extent it is successful is down to personal preference. The newly included arms race and demolition modes allows for a more fast pace and tightly confined CQC mode that allows the players little to no down time unlike the traditional bomb/defuse or hostage maps that most players are familiar with. For me though these modes are not the real meat of the game and if youre an experienced player these will only be glanced over and served as a side show at before delving into the traditional modes. The inclusion of some new weapons and equipment helps to change up csgo such as the Molotov and allow for different variations of old school tactics. Most of the well know maps are available from the offset and the workshop community is as good as it gets with newly created maps, game types and weapon skins to name but a few. There is the introduction of operation payback whereby a selection of community maps are promoted and available for players for a small fee across the whole of csgo and some of these are a delight to play. So why would you choose this over css for the experienced player. I find that it adheres to the original 1.6 far more closely then css ever did. The aiming is tight and follows the recoil sprays on many of the automatic guys far more closely. There are many updates that valve and hidden path are pushing though, such as spectator mode, competition spectators i.e. Dreamhack, newly released weapon finishes through drops and crate drops and newly revised maps being released mirage and cobble to name but a few. For me the main reason for this instalment above all others if the great competitive mode. Ranked csgo was never really available unless you sign up to a league such as ED, played pcws or cups. Now however with competitive mode 5vs5 ranked games are a blast if not for a few small problems that really need to be ironed out. These include dropped players being replaced by bots, hacking and over watch submissions, uneven rank matches to name but a few. If you though take the game as it meant to be played as a highly skilled social and fun game then the latest version of this simple but vastly complex game will delight you as it has me.	853.3

CS: GO stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety. Valve has not only updated the shooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries. This is Counter-Strike, whatever the format you choose to play it on, and there isn't a higher recommendation than that.	227.6

Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If youre a Call of Duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesnt care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas  entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location  but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.	158.2
Whether you're a casual FPS gamer or a very competitive hard-core player, CS:GO is where it's at. A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value. There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option. CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals. It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!). Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics. You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky! I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS). The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000! It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5. With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot. Don't be discouraged by the learning curve. With great effort, comes great rewards! Now GO buy it!!	742.7

This has to be the best Matrix game Ive ever played. The Story: You play as yet another person who was awoken from the Matrix and rescued by a Zion ship. The entire game takes place during a very specific training simulation that every recruit that has to run before he can jack back into the Matrix again. The aim of this simulation is to familiarise the trainee with various weapons he can acquire as well as basic tactics employed by terrorists and counter terrorist forces. In addition, this simulation is good at building a sense of teamwork and trust between the crew and their operator (referred to as Strat Caller). The Gameplay: Of course, as we learned in the movies, most of these training simulations are far from perfect. Some of the code used in it has been written by people with no formal education and the rest was pirated from the Matrix itself. This is cause for many anomalies we can observe within the simulation, but some argue that these glitches help the player get that surreal experience of entering the Matrix after living in the waking world. Most of these are small things like weapon having the wrong magazine size, missing fire selectors, fresh magazines looking empty, wrong ammo types (AKM uses 7.39x30 lolwut?). None of these subtract from the core of this game, however: the tension of being the last one alive and having all eyes on you is addictive. This game is in many ways the opposite of what is sold on todays FPS market. While a lot of people are hyped and praise some developers for discovering the Jetpacks and high movement shooters of the late 90s, this game keep a slower, more tactical pace. The guns have massive amounts of recoil and any sort of movement can throw your accuracy out the window. This places weight on map awareness and positioning more than what you would find in your average FPS game. The learning curve is steep and it doesnt simply boil down to learning recoil patterns. A lot of the time, you can win engagements by simply having better crosshair placement or having better communication then the enemy. Knowing where the enemy is and what gun they are using can easily win you the round even if you are outnumbered. This game also challenges you in a very in-universe way. Sometimes, the game will place Agents on the enemy team which will have all the godlike abilities they have in the movie: they know where you are and they have perfect aim. This can be a frustrating experience for most, but nobody said bringing down an Agent is easy. The Graphics: They are serviceable. Not much to look at here, you can run this on a toaster. Just make sure you stay away from Vsync, you want this game to run at 200+ frames. It's also worth mentioning that this is so far one of the few games that run perfectly on nVidia's Dynamic Super Resolution feature as I haven't encountered any UI scaling issues. The performance impact was negligable for me. The Sound: There is a lot of room for improuvemt here. The guns sound very weak compared to titles like Battlefield 3 and 4. The AK reminds me of a high pressure nail gun. There seems to be a bug when it comes to the sound engine deciding on which channel to play a sound, as people walking to my left sound almost the same as people walking on my right. The final verdict: Grab it on a sale. Its a fun game to play with friends. Its also worth mentioning that it already paid for itself by giving me a bunch of boxes that I sold on the market place. I ended up using the money to buy a bunch of gun, which is also another addicting aspect of this game.	158.1

Too many things are wrong in this game,movement is not smooth, awp and deagle are innacurate and not fun to play anymore, p90 and running is , flashes are not efective, nades are not accurate, limited wallbanging and  ammo limitation on M4, maps cluttered with unexpected props and corners to slow you down, certain areas are not wide enough and causes acidental TK on rushes and inability to rush fast as an whole, and the most important, recoil does not allow you to kill multiple enemies in 1 magazine in a short period of time, you are limited to short bursts and take cover, and that removes the ability to clutch rounds which was the most fun aspect in other versions. It prevents good skilled aimers from carrying a team. Also most maps are really bad unbalanced copies of CSS maps, like inferno and train, and people are forced to pay for operation passes to play extra maps in matchmaking. On the other hand there are many improvements in money and weapon balance specially on ecos, and other misc stuff like the GUI, matchmaking and de_nuke balanced, and I would rather play GO with this problems fixed than going back to 1.6 anyday, but at this moment the game is not fun anymore and gameplay is not fully oriented for competitive gameplay. I only play it because nobody plays the other versions anymore, and most people have to eat it up. This game had very low player count before the steam market update since the game was really bad, but after it many people started playing it to earn skins, so most of the players dont care about the game, they just idle for drops and watch streams to know on wich teams to bet on csgolounge, they dont actually care about the game, it is a sad truth and its clear that Hidden Path will never update this game to proper conditions.	1453.4

This game was the best tactical game I had ever played. The community was good, people were mature, sportsmanship was very well presented. But all of that changed when the skins came. The community of Counter Strike that we knew and loved got shattered in an instant. This community is turning into TF2 but instead of hats it is skins. It's a pathetic excuse from valve to build an economy to make more money off of virtual items. Really valve? You are turning this game into TF2 and it's a joke. More immature underage children are playing this game now and I don't like and I am certain that I am not the only one who thinks this way. First off, the community now is a disgrace. You could be playing with someone, become really good friends with them and then they ask for one of your good skins to "borrow". BAM! Skins stolen and your hard work has meant nothing. It increases the scamming within this steam community. Second, the competitive mode is great. It is challenging and very teamwork based, but all that can change with a steam sale. Hackers banned? Well then let's price Counter Strike: Global Offensive to 3.50. Oh boy that was a good idea right? A steam sale on this game is not only hurting us but steam as well. People also buy Counter Strike: Global Offensive on a different account, so that means if you are a low rank in competitive not only are you against a higher rank but you are also at a high chance to lose. It's a complete and utter disaster when it happens. It needs to end. Thirdly, Cases are ridiculous. You literally have a 0.01% chance to get a "Rare special item" (Knife). People waste so much money on cases when at the end of the day it's a "Virtual Item". You could go out and buy a real knife for about 50 at highest while the highest in this game is about 600. The economy is terrible. Community is terrible. Skins are a joke and Steam are probably laughing at you as you go out and waste money on cases. Fourthly and lastly is the, "Hit Detection". This game has a pretty bad hit detection system. Valve could go out and buy 124 tick servers but nope! they go out and be cheapskates and buy 64 tick servers which is god awful. I mean Valve, Come on! You make millions of  and $, why can't you actually just think about your game instead of how much money you take a bath in? This game is great once you get into it and "IF" you find a decent server (124 tick) it is pretty fun. One other thing I forgot to mention is when you play competitive there is a cooldown if you "leave", "Kill a teammate", "Kick too many players" or even if your power cuts during a match, you only have "3 minutes" to return to the match. Abandon the match? Ok sir we give you a 7 day ban. A ban ranges from 30 minutes to 2 hours to 24 hours to finally 7 days. It is a bit unfair the banning system. It is automatic so it cannot be revoked. Please Valve, fix your game and your community before it wrecks itself. 6/10 for Gameplay 2/10 for Skins 3/10 for Community 0/10 for Competitive Cooldown	452.7

Initially I was very hesitant about this game; it seemed very risky to make so many fundamental changes to a formula that was barely changed through Counter-Strike: Source and Condition Zero. However, seeing how much Valve has listened and continues to listen the community, and how quickly they make changes in both the short and long term, it has completely restored my faith in the game. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is incredibly fun and feature-rich, with plenty to do for both casual and competitive players. On top of this, there is also plenty of ways to promote and support eSports, which is a much-needed and fundamental step in reinvigorating Counter-Strike in the competitive gaming scene. However, the most important thing with this game is that the community is incredibly nice and friendly - and with a game as difficult and intense as Counter-Strike, it's extremely welcoming. Good stuff!	351.1

Great true Counter-Strike-like competitive feeling in this latest addition to CS games. It has most of the elements from the older CS games (1.6 and Source) but with updated visuals, weapon skins and stickers, matchmaking system and a goal to unite the two different Counter-Strike communitites: CS1.6 and CSS. This game does that pretty well having a lot of the good old content but still a lot of new stuff to discover. + + Easy to use Matchmaking system. + Updated content (some new weapons that were not in CS1.6 or CSS and new versions of all the classic maps) + Overwatch is a great way to get the community involved in banning cheaters but it's not perfect system (not at all) A lot of important information about the match is not available for overwatchers and in order to get ow you need to win 150 matchmaking games and have a rank at atleast Gold Nova 1. Players on that level are usually not good enough to judge is someone is cheating or not and some more suspicious cases may get more votes on "Evidence beyond reasonable doubt" even when no cheating is involved. + Skins and stickers. These things keep a lot more casual players playing the game and gives the more competitive ones new and exiting content in the game after playing the game for thousands of hours. + Operations that make people play the new maps and all the available official gamemodes makes the game to have more content (operations are usually pretty cheap ~5 containing usually 5 or more maps that can be played on Valves official servers and some kind of scoreboard that keeps track of your matchmaking stats like kills, headshot % and matches won) + Big professional tournamets mainly funded by the community. You buy a certain key to open a weapon case (Esport key in this case is the one that supports electronic sports) and a portion of the money goes towards these tournamets. These big events gather a lot of Counter-Strike people together watching the games and having some great entertainment. When the professional scene does well the game itself attracts more people playing it. + Game gets updated really often compared to many other multiplayer shooters. Sometimes there can be updates every week some of them being quite major. Valve even listens to the community sometimes to make the game even better and more enjoyable. (Obviously they want to hear what the pros have to say about the current state of the game) - - Lots of hackers playing in the higher rankings in matchmaking. As Valve killed boosting in its known form most cheaters are just the one who want get to those highest ranks. Still some boosting appears to be seen even tho it doesn't work like that anymore. - Matchmaking system is quite broken. Rankings don't show the true skill and ability to play as a team but it still serves the purpose. MM being 64 tick is the main problem or atleast thats what the community says when it comes to the system itself. Most players would still pick hackers over low tickrate if it was about matchmaking as whole. The problem around this is that to be able to get any advantage of 128 tick your game needs to run at atleast that 128 fps (not exatly but close to it) and according to Valve greatly over half of the players have an average fps of 30 or less. Thats not enough to get any advantage of high tickrate servers. Another proble with matchmaking is that sometimes it puts higher ranks against lower ones which is not equal at all and usually results in a slaughter of either side. Balance just sometimes isn't there. - Bad behaviour among many players makes some matchmaking games really feel like you'd like to punch somebody. People that refuse to use teamwork or communicate are even worse than bad behaving ones when you want/need to win games. - Valve has a weird way of updating something (like buffing a weapon) without any testing if it will actually work like it was supposed to. This has lead to CZ-75, AUG buff, the insane Tec-9 buff and a lot more weird but sometimes even funny updates. Still a little bit of testing on the field wouldn't hurt anyone. All in all I would totally recommend this game for everyone! Even if it may seem difficult at first you can only get better by learning and playing. For me it has been quite 4.5/5 experience so far so if you have the will give it a go!	1542.3

Standart Counter-Strike, with altered graphics. Added a lot of trash on the cards, machine, drums, and more. In some maps, the light falls so that it becomes impossible to watch. Physics has become even more disgusting. Particularly noticeable shooting Deagle. Played since closed beta test, nothing has changed after the release, with the exception of a couple of buttons on top (Show matches, Achievements, Inventory) Fairly well made selection matches conveniently find any game on the official server with good ping. (As there is not official server). In general, play nice, if you spend a lot of time to learn how to shoot. Overall CS and should be such for a given time. 9/10	712.1

CS:GO is probably one of the best multiplayer shooters out there, it offers such great gameplay and wide variety of gamemodes and maps to choose from. Counter-Strike has been around since 1999, and has grown since then. CS:GO may not please every 1.6 fan, but it has a lot to offer to the Counter-Strike scene. It has official competitive matchmaking, and supports the eSports scene of Counter-Strike. Most Counter-Strike major tournaments are hosted by GOTV and other sources like Twitch (which you can find on the main menu). It offers a ton of new gamemodes you made of heard before like "Arms Race," (AKA Gun Game) and "Deathmatch," (A all out Free-for-all). These gamemodes make Counter-Strike more friendlier to the casual players of the game. The old gamemodes are back in the modes Casual and Competitive. Casual is mostly for pub servers because it offers a more casual experience to the standard Counter-Strike gametypes like de_ (Bomb defusal) and cs_ (Hostage rescue) by turning off team-killing, always buy the essential equipment like Defusal kits and head armor. In the Competitive gamemode, it brings out the standard Counter-Strike competitively accepted settings. (some are modified like: Bomb time not being 35 seconds and instead being 45) This gamemode is for people who want to queue up with their friends and have a serious match with other players in competitive. Team-killing is allowed and many other hardcore settings to please the competitive audience. You might say to yourself,	1224.6

After your first few matches, you will be given a Skill Group. That, is your rank. It's based on your K / D ratio, and the amount of wins and consecutive wins you've had in previous matches. The Matchmaking system's job is to match you with players of your level. If you don't wanna play serious, though, you can still hop in the thousands of servers with random stuff! Deathrun, Zombie Survival, Deathmatch, you name it! It's still tons of fun. But the real deal is in Competitive. So, what are you waiting for? GET IT !	521.3
'Counter-Strike: Global Offensive' is an online multiplayer FPS shooter made by Valve. With the hours I've spent within this game I can confidently state that those hours were not wasted. This game offers more weapons, an item system, new maps, improved graphics and incredibly improved content from 'Counter-Strike: Source'. The game can be ran on non-up to date systems due to its adjustable graphics settings which will also allow the user to enhance the graphics. I can confirm that the game runs smoothly and is not jumpy which prooves how good of an engine the game has. Pros: - Smooth FPS - Incredible graphics for a Source Game - Balanced PvP - Item drops (makes the game that much more worth playing) - Wide variety of maps (+dlc) - Good players are rewarded within certain game modes - Players that leave during a competitive match are dealt with correctly Cons: - The Weapons and hipfire take a-lot of time to master (if not played a source game before) - Match Making Server System in the Competitive mode sometimes has one team where the majority of the players have a much higher ping (avg 100+) - Demo's sometimes (90% of the time) don't play correctly and are jumpy Overall I give the game 9/10 and highly recommend this game.	400.1

Day: 2,435 Still have not seen the light or eaten anything with nutritional value... I have purely been eating junk food and soda. I pee with a tube and a bottle taped to my Genitals, I also am sitting on my toilet 24/7. I have never gotten up from it nor will I ever do that... I have not showered in days EVEN IF it is five feet away from me. I have recently just gotten out of silver 1... hope I can put this on my college application... if I ever decide to go back to finish the 9th grade and so on and so forth. To make this long story short... 10/10 would buy 100x. P.S. I wasted most of my welfare on cases! :D HELP!	813.8
Counter Strike Global Offense, what makes it so great? What did Valve do that made it so popular? What does CSGO have that other FPS's don't? Here, let me list some pros and cons! Pros: 1. Huge Player base 2. Lots of different modes 3. Is very competitive 4. Takes a new approach to FPS's 5. Very well deatailed maps 6. Lots of different weapons to choose from 7. Action in CSGo is simply awesome 8. Fun and can be tactical when playing with friends 9. Can make money! 10. Is just fun, can't explain it any more then that, its just plain fun. Cons: Very rude and toxic community (You will be called a noob many times) Very addicting (WAY to addicting)	120.7
I have to say, originally, I did not want anything to do with this game. I have been a big fan of the series since starting with Beta 4 way back when. After CS:S was released, I was very content with the way the series had been progressing. The updated gameplay and graphics gave me a boosted interest in a game I had not played in several years. When Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was released, I was not feeling the same way. The frantic and well edited trailers made the game look spectacular, that is until I noticed it was still running on the source engine, albeit a modified version. Given the hefty price tag, I stayed away from CS:GO for as long as possible, until I noticed how many updates had been made since the first CS:GO beta, and the subsequent gold release. It was obvious, the developer planned on putting as much effort into maintaining the game as they were to keep the game fresh and even competitive. Once I finally bought the game on sale for a decent price, I realized what I had been missing. Competitive mode has changed the way the game feels and works. It was very easy to get bored playing CS:S, because as the popularity increased, so did the servers. Pretty soon you were competing against 32 players on the opposing team, making for a hellish free-for-all, despite the team based combat. CS:GO found the perfect solution by introducing a competitive game mode. Instead of having to play with your friends in 5v5 tournaments, CS:GO incorporated a 5v5 mode that mirrored the professional experience, making it a lot more fun to play. The fine-tuned competitive mode, coupled with officially supporting death match and the arsenal game modes, making CS:GO a game with a lot more re-playability, and a lot more fun. Some people are critical about the inclusion of skins, turning CS:GO into Team Fortress 2, but they fail to recognize the importance of customization. The skins don't really impact the gameplay, and are not overly obnoxious like some of the content included in TF2. In addition to the developer created content, the inclusion of community created weapon skins and operations allow community members to profit while increasing the awareness and fun of the game. I am not a fan of DLC, especially since most DLC is lack-luster overpriced content that should have normally been included in the game at launch, but was separated out to pay-for downloadable content in the interest of pumping out sequels and printing money instead of focusing on quality. CS:GO however, chooses community content to include, and gives back to the authors who continue to breath life into the game. Overall, I was skeptical when it was first released, but the developer's constant attention to detail and genuine intention to keep the game balanced and competitive has made this the best game in the series. I highly recommend fans of the series update to CS:GO and enjoy themselves.	323.9

This game was one of the best out there. I repeat: WAS! Can't recommend this anymore due to the immature community which reports you for every lucky headshot, and then you have the possibility of getting reviewed by some idiot Overwatcher and, when you're having the best time...VAC ban. Please, Steam, stop discounting this product and stop caring only about your wallet. You're giving hackers and smurfers more chances to ruin this fine masterpiece of CO-OP gaming. P.S.: I know 99% of you won't give a s**t on my opinion, but who cares about you gamers anyway. :)	697.9

I was playing competitive when someone told me to purchase a Molotov and throw it into Bedroom on de_dust2. I did. Three of my team members purposefully ran into said Molotov, killing themselves, and resulting in my seven day competitive matchmaking ban. 10/10	348.9
Yes yes and yes. Very fun! And one of my favourite games. It is very different from other games where you can just run around like a noob and expect to be the best player, this game is all about accuracy, tactics and team work which is great! There is always an intense feeling that I don't get from any other games!	1085.3
Throwing grenades in this game gave me a PhD in physics.	120.1
A great fps. I'm relatively me to pc gaming so I'm more of a cod player but cs go is definately the better of the two. Great game to play with friends and I highly reccomend buying it. Cheap price, One hell of a game!	280.2
The FUTURE of competitive gaming. I expect to see every family playing counter strike together within the decade. Families gathered around the telescreen, waiting for that last final clutch. The father fires one shot from his polished AK, it's wooden gloss glinting in the sun of the map of the year. The shot rings out, from the speakers of the telescreen. In that moment, the son contemplates his life's future. He sees a happy family playing by a white picket fence, his arm around his young wife's waist as they plant the "SOLD" sign on the front lawn. The daughter sees her prince charming, as they walk down the aisle together into an endless union of love. The father sees his glory days from college, the boys in his frat, and the touchdown pass he made his senior year. The mother sees herself with the young football star she fell in love with, two young mavericks against the world. The shot hits home, the match is won. The family hugs, their joy clearly visible together. They climb the stairs to bed, and prepare for tomorrow's activities. Tonight was just another normal night, but together they've all experienced something they'll never forget together. As you lay in bed this night, picture that scene in your mind's eye. You, your happy family all gathered to enjoy the future of competitive gaming. That's what Counter Strike Global Offensive was made for.	774.8
THIS GAME IS SUCH GOOD!	1068.2
Super fun to play, but as a third person shooter it fails to derive from the standard formula of its genre.	108.2
It's like quickscope simulator except you look like an idiot when you miss, like real life, maybe it should be called real life simulator then.	12.9

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a wonderful game, with a nice community and provides a way to rack up steam money in your wallet! You can earn weapon skins and weapon cases and sell them on the market for crazy money! This game is DEFINETLY worth it.	57.5

Game is great, didn't give it a fair chance in the beginning but now that they've buffed the AUG this game is completely captivating, I especially like the part when you kill the dragon and absorb it's soul, it makes me feel like I was really there in 1945 to see the end of the bloodshed.	890.1

By the time of this review I've played for a little over 11 hours. The moment I launched it for the first time, the main menu music had me hyped. I got addicted from a single music track. Then, when I played my first round in Competitive, I got completely obliterated. I started to play more rounds, and started becoming a decent player. So I'm just going to stop this review right here, and I'm telling you.. Buy this game. 10/10	65.0

Focusing on the quality of servers, my experience has been a 5/10 satisfaction with them. Even though my connection is less than 50 ping, with minimal packet loss, choke, and "var", I have often not been able to kill someone point blank with a FULL clip. Now you might say I'm just "bad" but I've been playing this game for almost 2 months(Yes that's more than 1400 hours!), and the game's physics are like my third hand by now. This is just outrageous that the official valve competitive servers can be this bad. You're better off playing on 3rd party leagues such as ESEA, that have decent servers, and more often than not, cooperative teammates. Moreover, the competitive servers are full of edgy, underaged players who talk down to the opposing team aswell as their own, regardless of your skill. There is an option to mute other players but that just ruins the entire point of the game if you can't communicate with your own team in order to fabricate a strategy to win the round. Nevertheless, that's bound to happen in any game, but its been on the rise on CSGO servers since its debut in August 2012.	1478.9

Have you ever gotten that feeling? You know, that feeling when you want to break everything in your house? So after moving to my fourth house I realized, oh I realized that I would buy a cat to relieve my stress and/or fix my anger issue. Around 10 minutes after buying the cat I snapped back into reality, and fell in love. My reality. The reality where a man could f*** a cat every now and then could feel the rough sandpaper like feeling of the cat's toungue on my . So me and my cat Jerome would go out and eat together. Upon coming home piss drunk I decided to open up steam. I stared counterstrike right in the face, then realized, I'm ready. I opened up the game and joined a competitive dust 2 match in the blink of an eye. Upon pistol round I was watching mid. The enemy team, being on T side decided to rush catwalk and I was killed instantly. After losing that round and the next two, our team decided to buy. Me, watching the same place, was killed again instantly by a tec-9. The enemy team got cocky and my blood started to boil. I looked around the room for anything to break and the only thing I saw was my cat. My one true love. Dead after being put in the microwave for half a minute. I cried. GG. Counterstrike kills. 0/10 will probably break again	1665.5

Human immunodeficiency virus infection / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a disease of the human immune system caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[1] During the initial infection, a person may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the illness progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more likely to get infections, including opportunistic infections and tumors that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems. HIV is transmitted primarily via unprotected sexual intercourse (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.[2] Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV.[3] Prevention of HIV infection, primarily through safe sex and needle-exchange programs, is a key strategy to control the spread of the disease. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. While antiretroviral treatment reduces the risk of death and complications from the disease, these medications are expensive and have side effects. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.[4]	480.2

This game should really be taken off of steam, the game is filled to the brim with smurfs and hackers. I have tried getting into it with friends on three different time and each time i get more dissapointed. The ammount of players never changes. The only reason they still have it as one of the top selling games is because of all the people buying for alternate accounts and its just sad that they have to do that please don't give valve money for this trainwreck they get enough from all the smurfs and hackers buying it for their alternate accounts.	667.2

CS:GO, 4th episode of CS... ( Counter-Strike, CS:CZ, CS:S, CS:GO) My rating 9/10 CS:GO is FPS Game, i think, that everybody knows CS, so we can move up to negatives and positives! Positives:	2083.2
(You can earn or lose money on skins, u can buy skins, trade skins, open cases and EARN money from that, almost same like TF 2, but much way better!)	1044.8
I highly recommend CS:GO , Counter-Strike:Global Offensive to all my friends because of the low price and the high replayability. With just this cheap game you will be able to play 10 times the time you normzlly spend on a triple A (AAA). I like they spend equal importance on the individual skill as they do on the team play. For me, this is the only real tactical shooter on the market at this moment. I like the high variety of maps and weapons and that they dont stop updating it with new operations wich offer new free maps and the ability to support the developers by buying these expansions (wich is totally unnecesary to be able to fully enjoy the game). Theres not only a casual matchmaking but also a competitive matchmaking for people who take the game more serious. Theres weapon skins to collect and trade and cases to open to try ur luck. This game litteraly has everything an fps needs and fps fanatics want.	981.0

I hate this game with such a passion. Its the biggest piece of  in the world, you never know what your team mates are gonna be like, and half the time they are just the worst.

The mechanics in this game are off for the most part: Movement is imprecise, tagging is almost not existing, weapons are way too accurate when moving, weapon balancing is bad (P250 + 5/7 are OP, P90), timings in matchmaking are wrong, matchmaking servers are REALLY bad, hitreg is bad even on a decent server (crouching + jumping - check youtube) and in general this game is designed for casuals while it claims to be a competitive title. CS:GO is no match for previous iterations of CS. Sadly.	937.3

Best Game I have Ever Played! And yes I have played that many hours don't judge me :~:. I just love how this game is designed from it's looks to its sounds, I have never heard any sounds like this having alot of bass in them. Sound is your best friend unless you want to get shot in the back of the head with an AK-47. And yet I thought this game couldn't get any better but Valve is still putting out updates for it including skins for your weapons to add that little extra dazzle to them while you deal some heavy damage to those damn terrorists. It also includes a competitive mode and ranking system if you ever want to play a serious game, but beware, most of these people in competitives aren't very nice no matter what you do, however, you may run into a few polite ones along your journey. And even better! When you shoot a chicken they EXPLODE. They also like to dress up into ghosts and reindeers in holiday events! If you ever have a spare $15 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PICK UP THIS GAME! Plus you can get some extra money from selling those skins for a few dollars ;D. Now please hurry the frick up and BUY THIS GAME 20/10! (Edited paragraphs after dashed line) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Well now i'm back to this review and oh god can I even begin to tell you how many updates they have put out since I have posted this? They now have a workshop in which you can make you're own camo's/skins to be picked by Valve to be put into this awesome masterpiece (Although, it is a bit complicating). This game is probably the most realistic game out there (next to Insurgency). It's nothing like ing COD where all you have is 10 year old trollers. You actually find people who are willing to help out AS A TEAM. Now I know i'm rambling, but stick with me, i'm gonna put pro's and cons in. Pros:- Quite realistic Can make some extra money Long lasting gameplay Competitive gamemode (ranked) Demolition An awesome arrange of guns Constantly gets updated. Cons:- People aren't always the nicest. Griefers. Well I think that is all I can add to this review apart that it is ic. Pick it up now.	2291.7

This is a great addition to the CS series. The maps look fresh, the models are great, and the gameplay is as tight as ever.

If you want a game to make you want to kill yourself, this is the game then good sir! Never have I been so dumbfounded by idiots who dont know how to play the game. PEOPLE JUST RDM ME FOR NO REASON, AND HALF THE TIME I'M A T, IT'S RIDICULOUS. I also think there is a glitch, because everytime I spawn it doesnt say innocent nor traitor in the bottom right. Whenever I get on this game I am constantly reminded of how bad I suck, and how awful people are for RDM. This game makes me cry everytime, yet I can't stay away from it, kinda like my ex-girlfriend. If I had to rate it, it would be 14 ripe bananas out of 18	109.1
You finally arrive in a deserted place ridden with crime and corruption, No civilians in sight. The sun hurts your eyes and you feel disorientated and wheezy. Its been a long trip, you're tired. You need your rest, you have to be up early in the morning for your first mission. After a restless night you get up and already miss your wife and kids, that could have been the last time you ever saw them. Kiss the photo with your kid on it, don't tear up in front of all the other soldiers. It'll be okay, your loving kid gave you a picture before you left, look at it and smile, keep it in pocket for good luck. Mission is starting soon. You're all geared out and ready to dispatch. Mission starts and your legs are shaking. It'll be okay, it'll be okay. You and your comrade are instructed to flank them, already hearing gunshots and screams elsewhere, sweat dripping off your nose. You teammate goes round the corner, you hear him scream and he gets sprayed down, his body falls over, his eyes wide open, you're stunned and unable to move, his unemotional face staring blankly at you. Your team aren't talking to you, they must have gone. You have no choice but to push forward. Dreading walking around that corner, don't know how many people are behind it. You finally push round the corner and... ING AWPED, THIS GAME IS SO ! >Limp Bizkit has abandoned the match and received a 24 hour competitive matchmaking cooldown.	679.8

First off : I am glad to say that it is nice that Valve gave me something that I can love and waste more time on than someone who loves making molasses, I still can't help feeling: HL3 ??? SHORT VERSION : Great, gameplay is great. Matchmaking is okayish? The weapon skins are also a nice touch but creates a gambling styled addiction among some players to get and open more and more cases. Hackers exist but few and far between generally. Worth astrnomical value on sale even for -33% or -20%. Frankly, it's price is perfect. You don't have to grasp your head around everything at once but it is fun all the same. With the obvious outta the way, this game is great. I can't possibly hate on it when I fail at it and I can't possibly not dance around in joy when I win. It's a fun action FPS once you practice well enough but beyond that is it very tactical. I love how you cannot aim down iron sights in this game seeing as every other game has used that as an excuse for you having such big wavy arm muscles you HAVE to be as accurate as the death star's laser when firing 300 rounds per minute. Instead it forces you to adapt and learn to fire a gun accurately to the point where you can fire the M4 or AK47 30 rounds per clip without spraying once and instead firing each shot individually but more importantly accurately. The gameplay is superb in this way. The game mode's are great but nothing particullarly rivals the Competitive mode which has you challenged so well that it adds to the fun. Arms Race is a great way to practice for beginners and I played it so much having very little time in the day (only a half hour or hour) and being unable to play Competitive that I can easily get to atleast 20 kills in a match of Arms Race or even win within 3 matches (often being the first however). Ever since then I got alot more free time that I had the liberty of playing competitive again! Matches have a nice 2 minute system where after that the defending team wins. Hurray, I can now kill usually between 15-20 people in a match on a good day. I think my record was something like 36 or 34. Good times... Valve really put alot of care into this because they always do. They play tested the crap out of and you can tell this in any Valve game be it Left 4 Dead, Half Life or Team Fortress 2. (Oddly enough, all of those sequels end on 2...) And though this might be the 4th or something, maybe 5th Counter Strike game beginning with the mod, going 1.6, CS Condition Zero/Deleted Scenes, CS Source and Counter Strike Global Offensive it only feels to have gotten much, much better over time. This apparently united the rival forces of 1.6 players and CSS players into one happy community. Hey, I can't argue that Valve put time into this and to speak of it's price tag DURING a sale like Summer or Christmas is astronomical in value. I bought it for 3.50, didn't play it on my old PC since it was crap and couldn't run it, didn't like it at first and kept with GMOD but eventually my friends forced me to get into it. It's use of rounds as opposed to RUN AND GUN mechanics is great. It forces the player to learn the enemy to win if challenged and also to learn themselves to play better and allows the player to be brought up into the game easier. At first the game may seem daunting and frustrating but past that is spectacullarly great. People new to the franchise tend to begin without thought, run and gun that sorta thing however over time you begin to learn to think tactically. I recommend the use of Flashbang and Smoke Grenades as soon as possible as it will save your life. Literally. The game rewards skill and intelligence and unlike other FPSes where the biggest, scariest and most famous gun wins, this has the holy grail of gameplay's as the only thing that matters is skill. And luck, but you can't control that so leave it be! However, there are some issues I have with the game. I have the problem of hackers occuring on lower ranked matches with my friends. I don't understand why anyone would cheat but in this game, where you get the glory of winning by being the smartest I really can't wrap my mind around it. The matchmaking is generally good though. You are put into ranks according to your skill after 10 matches. This allows fair and equal matchmaking generally. You will get into the odd circumstance where you play against very high ranking players like Gold Nova 2's and so on but this isn't ever a problem because with your brain you can find way's around them and how to win. Maps have the issue of being favourable to one team but once you are skilled enough, it means nothing but most people tend to play on maps that are familiar and work for them. I prefer nuke and dust and it is a shame that I just can't enjoy every map equally. Openning cases can create a gambling like addiction in rare cases but I do love how it affects : Nothing, it just maps your crappy looking HD M4A4 into something cool. Stattrak is also pretty nice but I do not like how it is built to give you something crap before something good. Still, I like how everything can we sold on the marketplace for money to put to MORE STEAM GAMES, can't argue. All in all, this game is more fun than a dolphin dancing around a dragon statue worshipping its new fake god. If I had to rate it, i'd say 9/10 for the lack of good maps like Dust II and occassional hackers but everything else is perfect. I recommend buying this game all the way. DO NOT HESITATE!	254.5

This is a very fun experience, and you can harvest money from fanboys who buy skins - I've earnt my money back 3x from when I bought it. Gameplay-wise, it is fun and it keeps me playing it but many of the systems could be a lot better. I love the tactical side of the game, and keeping it small scale makes it work extremely well, the use of flashbangs and rotating round the map, gathering info on the enemy weapons and locations to help your team. However the 64-tick servers mean on my screen, someone bleeds all over the wall because they took 3000000 shots from me, then when I die, apparently I did 0 shots. The recoil is also a bit exaggerated and not as good as in Counter Strike: Source. The ranking system claims to be ELO-based but seems to just be: "Get a win-streak of 6 and you'll rank up" not at all based on your own performance or the enemy ranks In Source, your body would be jolted by the recoil and so your view would be shaken, but your bullets still went wherever your gun pointed. In CSGO, you keep firing and your gun stays in the same position, but your bullets decide to bugger off to the moon, randomly levitating from the gun's barrel. Overall, extremely fun gameplay, but mechanics can be dodgy and faulty.	457.0

It's important to appreciate games like this for what they are, and this game is a callback to a past chapter of video game history that's been buffed and polished. And unfortunately as someone who never actually played the original Counter-Strike games, I'm not in much of a position to judge exactly how well they pulled this off. Basically, it entirely boils down to the kind of person you are. If you're a die-hard Counter-Strike fan, then this is probably all you can ask for. If you're a more typical gamer who just finished playing Crysis or Battlefield and wants to pick up something to play over the weekend, then trust me when I say that this is NOT the game for you. It's the online FPS equivilent of Dark Souls, in a way.	69.8

I've spent exactly 1.2k hours playing this game in all my accounts , i've found that this game is the best FPS game you can ever play. And here's why : First of all , you need some skills to play this game correctly , and when you get enough skills , you'll get more fun and more fun! Second , if you play this game with your friends , you'll get into it faster than playing SOLO , so its more fun with your friends instead of playing with randoms , then u'll try to be more better especially if you find a decent mates-team that plays with you , you'll start looking for some strats , then you'll play it more like serious. Third , for graphics , i dont really care about any game's graphics when its fun , but CS:GO's graphics are decent so there is no reason to complain about it. 4th , its gameplay , that every COD player complains about it. especially 'recoil' its really hard to control it but that's the the game you need to practice with your recoil , and try to find out the best settings you can play with. And there is alot of good things about this amazing game but sadly i cannot write them all in one review . And there is some bad things about this game , like after every update some people start getting some weird lags , i think they need to fix it , and if you're looking to play this game more serious , dont play on MatchMaking servers , because its full of R_E_T_A_R_D_S and alot of trolls and its a land of AFKs , thats just made me feel mad , just go on esea , esl , leetway and so on , and one more thing , and its after about every steam sale , CS:GO become a land of cheaters , and thats just redicouless. The reason why I'm not playing much lately because I need to focus on better life decisions and many important things. Finally i hope you find this review a helpful review and thanks for reading.	373.2
