"team fortress 2 is an awsome fps (and tp) game, it has some weapons from the future, some of them are historical, someof them are existing today... and there are cool gamemodes too! like control points (cp_) payload (pl_) king of the hill (koth_) and sd_. let me explain one of them: control points is a team fortress gamemode, and the most popular c.p. maps are cp_gorge and cp_dustbowl. the gamemode is simple: the re team is defending, and the blu team is attacking. the blu teams goal is to stand on the control points for a time. the red teams job is to prevent the blu team for controlling a point. usually, control point maps have 2-3 control points, but there are c.p. maps which have 4-5 points too! the other gamemodes are good too, so go and check them out for yourself, in the great world of team fortress 2! ~by: =[o.w.n.]= kirito",1195.2
"its a hat simulator with a first person shooter minigame",935.4

"this is the best game i ever played i also like this because of the mvm(mann. vs machine). it is also controller supported so also good for console gamers. download this game or i will find u and give u a slap :d.",917.7
"team fortress 2 its a pretty good first person shoter game of course its also f2p + there is a random chance to get items there is also trading if you like new items + hats + weapons and if you dont have any money this game is perfect for you just try it out",2010.2
"you know what class would be cool? what? a pyro. and what will it be used for? camping corners and totally destroying anyone that comes close to them with over powered weapons lets add it. team fortress 2 in a nutshell. 10/10",828.0

"its free... until you get adddicted enough to buy premium! great game, try it",865.2
"well, i wasted 200 hours of my life on this. 25 hours as just one class, so thats a whole day gone of just being a pixelated avatar. so, i ask you, if i wasted 200 hours of my life on this- do you really think its a bad game?",688.9
"awesome game i play this for hours i mostly like the gamemode mann vs machine because of the concept that the worlds being taken over by robots, and team fortress classic being on the goldsource engine instead of team fortress 2s awesome new source engine with better graphics... more like portal 2.",157.4
"this is the best hat-simulator out there! it even has hats! you can let you characters wear hats! also, hats!",843.6
"this is a very fun game i like it and im very sure you will too",247.6
"lolz.... at first i hated this game with the upmost disatisfaction ever possible ask any of my friends who palyed with me.... coming back to this game a month or so later.... i actually enjoyed it playing... now its one of my top games that i enjoy and will continue to play through the dayzzzzz :) its such a fun game if you wanna pass the time, not be to serious, and watcth others explode, either by wrreches, rockets, or rurrets :) 8/10",11.5

"its the (in)famous game; hat simulator 2. took all my money i regret nothing 11/10",1171.8
"its a ptw, pay to win, type of game. you get crates from random drops but then you have to pay to open them. yeah... i dont think so. you can get the occasional weapon that drops but its never anything good that can even compare to the next guy who has dumped some $200 into the game and he can just look at you to make you explode. it was fun at a time when you have friends to play with and you are still blind to the micro transactions that your enemy makes to get an upper hand.",61.0
"in case you cant tell, i love this game. just look at how many hours i have on it. it is hands down the best multiplayer fps out there. also its free to play. and free things are awesome. you do need to buy at least one item from the in-game store to get a premieum, but the cheapest item is currently $0.10, so its not that big a deal. now, onto the gameplay. this game appeals to all people who like fps games. wanna snipe? go sniper. wanna be a healer? go medic. wanna be an indestructable tank in the battlefield? go heavy. the list goes on and on. its wonderfully balanced (except for the gunslinger). also the hats are pretty neat.",2038.0
"by far one of the games ive played the most, this is a must have if youve got steam and you like first person shooters. theyre always adding new content and it always helps make the game feel fres, unless of course youre too busy trading the in game items to even play the game itself haha.",1520.6
"i have spent 1000+ hours on this game... i am kind of ashamed but also kind of not. this game is a real time consumer with the item drops and everything but it isnt bad. its fun to play with different classes and use different weapons and loadouts. since its f2p theres allot and when i say allot i mean allot of noobs playing but youll get used to it. 7/10",1257.0
"if i could go back in time i would make sure the tf2 font never existed",137.7

"this game is still a blast. plenty of game types to play and different job types to switch around and play with.",8.0
"its an verry awesome game i recome it for everbody :d",610.0
"listen to your dumb selfs, cod is superior in gameplay and money to team fagtress 2. an xbox costs $10-20, and cod is free because its so good they made a lot of money so they give it away. a pc costs $100000 and team faggy 2 costs $999 and you need $235555 to upgrade the  pc each year. and cod runs on a superiour gfx engine that can run1080p at 1000 fps forever and you get money for playing cod so you ers better shut the  up cuz im prestiged in real life ok",1565.9
"great game, everyone should try it and download the game, regardless of experience. screaming kids and micspammers make the entire game much more amusing.",727.5

"this game is really fun. no matter if youre f2p or p2p or can still get items, but what makes this game so additing is the fact the you do earn weapons and items and the game is still being supported after 8 years and over 400 updates (wow). a lot a dedication. so all in all fun game download it and play.",1083.4

"this is the best game gabe newell has ever invented.aside from the bugs and glitches,its a game worth playing. thanks gaben",622.4
"this game has a lot of great things about it that makes it worth playing. the fact that its there is no real leveling system and how good you are at the game depends on your skill only and not leveling up or picking perks is absolutely amazing. it forces you to learn and get better at the game. its great to play by yourself but so much better when you have a group of friends to play with. the best free to play game ive ever played.",778.5
"if you are looking for a good multiplayer game with lots of different mapps and play styles this game is the one for you.",261.5

"once you start playing tf2 you cant stop, it pulls you into a pleasant frenzy of killing that you will do over and over again without thinking twice.",1200.4
"theres far too much to say about this game. the people are as diverse as the gameplay - theres the trolls, and theres the good guys. the game defines balanced by making everything unbalanced and overpowered, and thats the fun of it. you become badass by a mixture of practice and chance. definitely worth getting. also, go premium as soon as possible.",877.1

"i think this is a prety fun game i recommed this game",506.9
"really nicely done game, the graphics are good but the owners havent been doing much lately, the people with 4000+ hours played are getting bored and its getting repeditive, in my opinion we need this wonderful game to get fixed up a little, in ways that will improve it and make it better for all of us.",19.5
"7/10 good game the only thing bad about it is the little kids crying on the mic.",1045.5
"this game is awesome and i recommend it to everyone out there who likes fps. it is one of my top ten games i have played",451.0

"sup bros, tf2 is one of my favorites since my 13th birthday. lets get started. so first off you have to go to training mode. once you know all the tricks and moves, you are ready to play. its a really awesome game filled with hats, weapons, and maps. warning: do not put on the ghostly gibus, unless your a f2p!",162.0
"this is a good game i like it alot sometimes i can play this game for hours on end. but sometimes i get mad at the game because people on the server have better weapons then me and it makes it hard for me to stay alive. although i still try to have fun if your looking up to playing this game you should but one other thing althogh you might have a good weapon it always depends on your skill and experance with the game it may take a while to get use to i know i did but over all its the best free game ive played so far. hope you have good luck in your time playing i know i have thanks for reading.",852.2
"a creative, sometimes enraging good game. not for all ages, but very good and well though out. my favorite game by far.",1012.8

"this game is awesome, when i started playing it was really hard, but now its very easy to play :)",2508.3
"team fortress 2 is a fast action paced first-person shooter.featuring nine classes each with their own abilities.if you are new to team fortress 2,you should try it out.if you like the game alot,i recommend you to become a premium.being a premium is alot more fun then before,you can trade,get more drops and even better drops.the better drops did not occur for me ,but most premiums might get the better drops.overall,my rating of the game is 94%.",1890.1
"in this game, you play as a cartoon character wearing a hat. every character has his one-liner, such as pootis or gottam. you objective is to communicate with other players to receive more hats.",766.6
"the best ever. i could take six facials abuses in a row for a piece of tf2. yes.",214.3
"earlier or a year ago... i said this game is epic and worth getting reality... this game is sooooooo ing  do not get this piece of dog ! there are so many sweaty little low life bangouts who always get lucky!!! thats not the worst part!!! everytime you do good in a ing team, there is always one troll who has to bring up a vote for scrambling the team and everytime it succeeds, thus you being in a rubbish team. the community is utterly horendous nowadays with people who always brag and boast and tryhard. do not get this game!!!!!!! my recommendation... :)",223.4
"a game in which you have to play with others to protect your box fort. nothing more to say.",96.9
"im so sry that i just cant play this game anymore... maybe its because of all that robots updates and tons of new weapons add a competitive 5vs5 or 9vs9 with ranks like cs go and there would be sense for old school gamers like me (that are f*** annoyed by ppl that try to trade ingame instead of pushing the cart) it feels like no one cares playing the objective,everyone is just running around like an idiot trying to get 360 noscopes and what so ever but still, i cannot downvote this game cause i had a great time, enjoyed it even more than counterstrike or any other games out there",851.6
"i love this game. i love that it is free to download. it can be a bit annoying that the download takes a while but this game has been going through a lot of updates so the wait is worth it. my favorite class is the engineer and i wish one day valve will let me find my first australium weapon for the engineer. (australium wrench) i am very excited for any future updates to this game. dont ever change valve. :d",867.3

"as famous with valves other free-to-play games, its fun no matter how much (or little) money you spend. you can simply focus on playing the game, as youre on equal standings with everyone else as far as items and character balance. other free-to-play games offer rediculous advantages for even more rediculous prices, or make gameplay nearly impossible to enjoy without paying. team fortress 2 is definetly one of the best free-to-play games ive played.",222.2
"to give a negative review of this game would be insane. this game has taken the multiplayer co-op genre by storm, one of the best team-based fps as far as i am concerned. the nine classes each have their pros and cons and valve has did an amazing way of balancing the games weapons, i have yet to even encounter a single hacker or cheater in my 470+ hours in this game. its unique style of graphics and amusingly funny personalities of the nine classes even add more immersion to this game, there is no reason for you not to have this game yet, it is free and perhaps the main reason why people get steam is just to play this amazing game.",884.9
"this game is the ing best, i have sunk almost 600 hours into it and plan to keep going. dont judge this game because its not cod try it out and you might just like it.",1061.0

"this is a pretty good game, its free. if it lags, dont blame the game, blame ur laptop doesnt have enough memory",386.0
"this game is so awesome, especially because it is free to play! join in with your friends on the action paced game, including 9 different classes! scout - capture enemy objectives to help out your team! soldier - blow your enemies to pieces and rocket jump to get around the map faster! pyro - burn your enemies to the ground and spycheck for enemy spies! demoman - place stickies on your objectives to blow enemies to pieces when they try to capture it! heavy - defend points with much toughness and a high rate of fire with your minigun! enginer - build your own base including a sentry gun, dispenser and teleporters to help out your team! medic - heal your allies, use bercharge to give a teammate and yourself invulnerability! sniper - pick of easy targets from a distance with 1 shot to the head! spy - disguise and lure the enemy team you are one of them, get behind them and backstab them with your knife! a highly recommended game!",509.0

"team fortress 2 is a competetive fps (first person shooter) with loads of different gamemodes, weapons, classes, and other items to help in your gameplay. the game runs extremely well on my low end laptop, and even better on my gaming laptop. it is a must have for all valve fans alike.",3.9
"i dont know if youre going to believe me, but... this game has hats. btw have you seen my wallet?",403.7

"definatly the most epic fps game ive ever played and ill keep playing. till no stop. nothing can take this game place and i bet there wont be. i recommand this game to everyone . go get a gibus and join the action p.s. this game isnt just about killing. this game got lot of diffrent gamemodes that you can have fun with. my fav mod is jailbreak.and im addicted to it and ill bet youll be. go get this game ! its f2p. this is a must game on every library.",1059.6
"this is by far my favorite game. i personally like class-related games, especially when one of them is like the spy. if you dont have this game yet... then your brain has failed at making a choice.",1785.7
"team fortress 2 started off just being a unique artstyle on an old (& amazing) game, but with all the updates its actually worth playing now. you can customize your character, change and upgrade your weapons, multiple game modes including a new coop mode, item drops, crafting system, steam marketplace (sell your stuff or stuff you craft), and this new replay system... i get a hat if i get a thousand views.... btw the game is free.",375.5
"fantastic!! absolutly love this game and have great fun playing it with my mate.",81.6
"i played too much of this game and i didnt have that much fun as it is in fact a receptive shooter thats no where near as fun counterstrike and quite a few other games. i personally dont recommend this game as its just not that fun. also hats lots of hats. hats make it better. 5.5/10",57.2

"re-review so, i played this game for about 560 hours, or close to it, and i have to say, i was not entirely enjoyable from the time i began to now there has certainly been a degrading quality in the community,market and game. on the community aspect, it seems that, for the unfortunate turn, many have left and those who remain have no real business in playing anything well (case and point mvm). the market has crashed essentaliy putting my 2 years of trading work going to the dumpster, and of course everyone moved to the csgo market. the game overall has had little content changes and barely anything new concerning gameplay, of course valves hat fetish has gotten the best of them. i can honestly say that while this game is free to play i spent quite a bit on it, and i really do regret it.",559.4

"a very cool free to play game definitly pick it up if you got some free time to waste. at the moment very balanced as well, all the nine classes really fit into the game. which is really important because in most games that has diffrent classes there is always an overpowered/overplayed one. valve should put more time in its competitive scene tho.",1423.3

"ok so heres what i think of this game. it is a fun kinda non realistic fps multiplayer game which involves many different weapons for the 9 classes ( scout, soldier, pyro, demoman or demoknight, heavy, engineer, medic, and the 2 assassins for hire the sniper and the spy) and tons and tons of hats! if you like a kinda fast paced fps game with multiple loadouts and gameplay this is your game! it has rocket launchers (and rocket jumping) double jumping, backstabs (which include stair stabs,side stabs and corner stabs ) and sticky jumping and much more. i would suggest taking the time to download this game so you can just lay back and shoot people withput getting into full on rage mode. it also has sprays. it is really fun and you should take the time to downlaod it.",1078.3
"team fortress 2 is absolutely astonishing! it combines cooperative teamwork and intense moments in one large package. this game is extremely balanced and has numerous things to do that will keep you occupied for months and years to come. tf2 also incorporates creativity, as it provides you with the opportunity to create and customize your own classes with epic hats and weaponry. this game is a must have, and i would reccomend it to any pc gamer who takes interest in action, or shooter games. i hope to see you in-game!",1285.4

"tf2 has had a strong community for many years, and for good reason. beneath all the weapon unlocks and silly cosmetics, the game has one of the most balanced set of mechanics of any first person shooter that i have had the chance to play. all the classes are situational, allowing intelligent players to deal with a wide variety of situations. the health, mobility, and damage of each class is fine tuned to make sure there is no clear cut best class, and in less organized games one can do well with any class given enough experience. each class presents such different game play that the replay value is very high, and there are many populated servers to play on. it also has a very active competitve scene, for when you feel your skills have evolved to the next level. overall, tf2 is still around because it is a great game and i would certainly recommend it to anyone who is interested in a fast paced first person shooter with some comic relief.",1799.9

"team fortress 2 (more commonly reffered to as tf2) is a must-have for pc gamers, it isnt the best game on steam, but its certainly one of the essentials to most players libraries. whats so fantastic about tf2 is that it actually is one of the few shooters that does require teamwork. each of the 9 characters has something vital to winning a match, and so it relies less on skill (although this is still important) and more on things like: medic focusing on certain players and the sniper doing his best to hold the fort. another pro is that it can be played casually or competitively, you can hop into a match and have a little fun, or you can gather a team and use commands to become a somewhat unbeatable squad. furthermore, the world in which your warriors wage war on one another is so deliciously colourful and cartoonish that the game never feels like its taking itself too seriously. still a marvel to behold...all for the awesome price of free!",34.2

"this a very entertaining game that allows you to battle with friends, or just anyone, by choosing one of nine classes that each has their own pros and cons. you will either be on team blue or team red. obviously, the teams are against eachother and you want to battle the opposing colour. there are a variety of game modes to choose from where you must beat the other team. you can trade items, and there is even a whole currency for this game that is used in trading, or when identifying the price of your specified item. overall i think this game is great. i highly recommend it for people who love action filled games, and who love to learn new skills. i recommend helping your team out if you would like to win, and dont leave them behind. team fortress 2 is a great game, but is better accomplished as a team rather than a singular person. if youve never tried the game, i recommend you give it a shot, its loaded with entertainment, and you might just like it.",1131.8
"i bought this game a few years ago in 2009...well... lets say i just found the idea of earning money , having fun , enjoying the fps and talk whith other players. i would give it a rate of 8/10 how enjoyment. now ya can download this game and have fun.",1961.3

"team fortress 2 is one of the best, if not the best, game i have ever played in my life, has one of the biggest communities supporting it, and not letting it slip down into the vast pit of games people have forgotten about. even if people say, tf2 is stupid because everybody is only worrying about hats and cosnedics. still, dont judge a book (or game) by its cover. in my opinion, tf2 is so much better than any other fps game, mostly because of that theyre barely any 3 year olds playing and complaining about how this one guy keeps backstabbing him. 200000000000000000/10 (edit: and mostly always im the one doing the backstabbing...)",465.8

"an interesting concept in a game. the first ive heard of to be an fps game meant to be funny, in which it is highly successful. the taunt system adds infuriating humour to the defeated and the comical lines voiced by the 9 classes are hysterical. i rate tf2 with a 9/10 for humour thanks to that system. the game has very little lag problems, being able to easily run on even poor computers. i rate tf2 with a 10/10 for lag. the game is fun and original, with dozens of ways to play. i rate tf2 an 8/10 for gameplay. the game has great graphics for a game that came from 2007, and still has good graphics to this day. i rate tf2 7/10 on graphics. i overall rate tf2 to be a 9/10 game, being a solid and fun game for mature gamers. i highly recommend this game. -doctor brony",537.3

"get your favourite hat and conga out of spawn to your teams doom. sometimes the two opposing teams will just screw around with high fives, flips, and, the game changing taunt, congaing. once it starts, theres no way to stop it. but usually the occasional tryhards ,people who are bad at having fun, will try there best to stop this wretched thing called fun... or get kills on their stranges because they cant legitimate kills on you. for example: when i conga, 1 of the 4 people of some sniper gang, i like to call tryhard tribe, can only kill me when i conga. how to take care of them? kill all 4 of them cause theyre terrible at sniping. how bad? bad enough when i stand still, they miss me and i get closer to crying because of how bad they are. bye bye.

"if free to play scares you away from this titile: dont let it. it is a great game! there is no need to pay anything, as all items are given though drops, the more you play, the more stuff you get, premium player or not. speaking of premium player. you become one by spending any amount of money in the game, even under $1, and you will always be a premium player, no subscriptions. this basically lets you have more items, and sometimes get hats and rare (but only cosmetic) items through the drops. players are not hindered by being free to play, or by not playing a lot. the default guns given are balanced, and unlocked guns provide benefits in some areas, but have negatives in others (ex. a larger clip, but no random critical hits). all in all, the only thing that will make you like or hate the game is the gameplay, not the pricetag. if you like fps games, you will love it, if not, still give it a try, you could have fun, and not need to worry about being locked behind a paywal.",1132.9

"team fortress 2 has the most balanced classes around with some being more for new players and others being for the more experienced. take the sniper. the sniper is the easiest class in the game and it is extremely easy to use. it is recommended to try and shoot the body and not the head, as it does almost the same amount of damage. the pyro however, is almost impossible to master and the people who are able to use it well have been called w+m1-ers. this stands for win+medic1, because a pyro and a medic are almost unstoppable and can win the game if the pyro has any decent amount of skill. the heavy is also one of the harder class, and the win+medic1 also applies to it. there are many great game modes and maps, but i love deathmatch on 2fort myself.",164.1

"team fortress 2 is literally my favorite game of all time. this game is great for free to plays and pay to plays. for free to plays, you have stock weapons which are actually very balanced, and with the drop system you can get any weapon with different stats, (ecxept reskins and hats and misc. but they do matter in terms of stats.) you can play against a pay to play and win, because its really about skill and experience. where the game shines is really in its community. most people are generally ecxepting of noobs. mainly because the game features so many silly things to play around with. its also refreshing from your average realistic military fps. i personally like the sort of cartoony artstyle of the game. theres so much im leaving out about this game, but if this is reason enough for you to buy it, youre crazy! its free god dammit!",928.6

"really nicely done game, the graphics are good but the owners havent been doing much lately, the people with 4000+ hours played are getting bored and its getting repeditive, in my opinion we need this wonderful game to get fixed up a little, in ways that will improve it and make it better for all of us.",19.5

"this game is very fun to play, but will get boring after about a thousand hours. whatever you may have heard, this is not a pay-to-win game and everyone has an equal chance. in fact, the stalk weapons are usually your best choice and buying weapons is not the way to go. do not fall for the buying keys and openning crates thing. you will regret it. also, unusual hats and strange/festive items are pretty useless with just a few cosmetic perks, so dont feel down if you dont have any. this is a multiplayer must-have though.",133.5

"this is an amazing game that is very fun (and addicting) to play. a lot of work has clearly gone into the game design, but it would be far better if not for the heavy orientation on microtransactions. the way ive come to see it is this: people spend money, real money, which they put their own blood, sweat, and tears into earning, on virtual (i.e. not real) hats, which they can put on virtual characters in a game where you dont typically see other people up close for over ten seconds. sound like a fair tradeoff to you? me neither. bottom line is, dont buy anything, and this games a barrel of explosive, bone-crunching fun.",53.3

"this long overdue and much loved game is a blast, class based warfare on a smaller scale than battlefield, which is nice. the game is very stylized and cartoonish, which i think is nice, because not only does it feel like a game, but its hilarious to look at. even if you die, chances are, youll be chuckling. there are 9 classes in total, and because of that diversity, the game play really feels varied. overall, team fortress 2 is a very solid class based shooter on source that will be enjoyed for many years to come",18.0

"first of all, i dont really understand why this game isnt as popular as for example cs, cause its basically the same genre but tf2 disposes of much more diversified gameplay part where ingame scenarios are very variable due to 9 classes available for playing. maybe some people dont like animation-style graphics but apart from this questionable part, it is perfect multiplayer fps game i ever played or heard about, highly recommended for all cs nerds tired of the bomb has been planted",937.6

"very balanced game. every class has strengths and weaknesses. i.e. spies are weak against pyros that routinely check for spies, engineers (the guys that set up sentries and ammo/health refillers called dispensers) are constantly looking around for spies as spies can destroy their buildings. if you lose, the only reason you lost is the other team were better than yours. period. and i dont mean you. this is a team game. if you cant work as a team, you will lose.",155.4

"ok first of all, where should i start with this game? it is probably my favorite game in my library. it is really fun and is a unique first person shooter; i believe what makes this game so great is because of the multiple options you are presented with in-game. you get nine classes to choose from, scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and last but definitely not least the spy! this game is excellent and i reccomend it to anyone who wants to play a fun game.",168.0

"team fortress 2 used to be a game. i know thats hard to understand for many of its current players but its true. back when it came out it was a simple, yet well made team based shooter. hats were something old people wore and people paid for the gameplay rather the looks. those were the times. nowadays tf2 is an economy where thousands of dollars change hands every day as people quest for those rare items that will set them apart of the rest. real life money and other games are exchanged for cosmetic items based on rarity rather than function and valve is making money by the truckload. on one hand i want to congratulate them for this utterly brilliant business model that has truly made them a power to behold. on the other hand i cant help but worry that well start seeing more and more games where gameplay is secondary to various forms of dlc and micro-transactions, where people play, not for the game, but for the hope of making money.",2483.2

"okay, unless you have some operating system other than windows, mac os, or linux, you really have no excuse whatsoever to not own this game. i used to think i was not a fan of first-person shooters. i was wrong. this game has scads and scads of humor that kept me going through the early learning periods, allowing me to laugh off my failures instead of get frustrated at them. what i didnt realize at the time, though, was i was still learning how to play. and by the time the humor was wearing thin, skill was taking over. i might have only been classified as competent, but i wasnt mindlessly killing myself over and over. i was making a difference, even if just a small one, in each and every match. if you like fps games, get it. if you dont, get it. if you want a hat simulator, get it. if you want a completionists wet dream, get it. and best of all, of course, it. is. free.",295.7

"the best hat simulator in the world. its probably the only one too that has you killing people .",730.9
"very fun and addicting game. like cod, but with more humor and weapons. it makes you spend hours and hours of gameplay inbetween. now, with mann vs. machine, it packs it up with the robotic boogaloo update, and tons of hats and weapons to obtain. it packs a punch, such as when you get hit with a market gardener crit, or just simply going on a lazypurple silly server, and mess stuff up. my personal favorite of the game is rocket jumping. i spend most of my time on the scout class, seeing that i packed tons and tons of time on this, getting stranges. this game is an immediate 10/10. you just need to know how to play and know what you are doing. my suggestion, do not play team fortress classic. it is the worst experience in tfc. it is nothing like this game. other than the previous, it is an amazing game. edit: also ruined my life. still the best game ever.",770.7

"this is one of the best first person shooters i have ever seen in my entire 7 years of gaming, its fun, customizable, and has 9 unique classes that can easily tell any other games classes to eat out of the dumpster. the gameplay is suitable for 90% of the people who even pick up a game, it is truly amazing, and i cant wait to get the next few updates.",285.1

"amazing game. all steam users should have this in thier library. super fun, never gets old. the community is amazing for the most part. here and there you run into some losers but thats with every game. trading in this game was my favorite by far. my advice is to have a good pc while playing this game even though you dont need it, it will the make the gaming expierience glorious. download this game asap. meet new people and go get som ing hats!!! overall 10/10 would play again!",1737.2
"this game is soooooooooooooooo god ing awesome!!!! its beter than the original teamfortress even im a noob on it",95.6
"team fortress 2 is a very fun game with alot of action in it. there are 9 different classes making it more fun cause most free to play games only have about 3-4 classes! you can play as each one get hats and miscs for them and even many different taunts like the conga! there are also many different wepons to each class! there are so a many different types of game modes like pay load is where you have to push a cart holding a bomb into a hole. you have saxton hale where there is one guy and your whole team trys to fight him (also known as vsh). there is cp which is control points which you try to capture the other teams control points to win the game (most recommended to play for starters). then you have much much more when you start to play team fortress 2. i hope you found this review helpful!",2791.6

"fun until you get banned from your fourth server for hacking when youre just shooting people.",1374.8
"i used to hate this game because i sucked at it. i sucked at it because i played it like a normal first person shooter and rushed things and didnt think and tried to play like i owned the map before i knew what all the classes did. this game isnt your average multiplayer shooter. it is the most balanced multiplayer game you can find. the name team fortress is true to its title because if you want to win you have to act together as a team, and not for yourself. the game takes a while to learn but if you can pass the frustrating beginning of multiplayer you will find yourself addicted to this game. be warned. this  is like is heroin.",280.7

"if i had to pick one game that rose into my favourites faster than any other, it would undoubtedly be team fortress 2. with its cartoonish characters each unique and with addictive personalties, and action filled gameplay, combined with 9 different classes each with their own strengths, weaknesses and styles of gameplay, this game is one of the greats! being very easy to get the hang of, this game is great for newcomers to fps games but there is no end to improving. good at scout? try heavy. or try a whole new style! overall a great game.",606.0

"originally, i downloaded this game simply for content in garrys mod, thinking i would never take interest in it and play it. i made a mistake. i started playing it in early september, and im very glad i did. everything about it is so loveable. the less realistic, stylized art style, the map design, the gamemodes, the variety of the classes, (the satisfaction when you kill a really good player), weapons, hats and outfits, and the constant stream of community made items! in my opinion, it is far better than other fps games on the market, and its free! without a doubt, i recommend this game to anyone who wants exactly what team fortress 2 has to offer, or someone who simply wants a game to be addicted to!",947.5
"this game is ing terrible, the community is complete autism mostly pony  the game play is linear, the graphics are interesting and the lore is ok, but at the same time you get sucked into it only to get spawn killed or have a completely  team, after a few games ive usally always been in the top 5 in each game my point being it takes not skill and some people people will determine your skill with the ammout of stupid  you have from the game aka hats ect.",24.4

"should write a real review for this game. when tf2 started, it was a game with no weapon customization. nowadays, the game is defined by weapons instead of classes itself. skill is completely seperate from the realms of class capability and weapon capability. but that doesnt mean that performance is. if you are going to play on any server with all weapons allowed, there is a lot going against you no matter what. generally, no matter what strategy you adhere yourself to, there is a weapon designed to deal with that. if there was a world without latency, perhaps this would not be an issue. when a player plays on a big server, and things like alltalk and good communication are not used as they are in competitive play, the player has a greater chance of becoming the victim of a weapon specifically designed to feed off an unusual situation. in summary, tf2 is basically a two-team struggle against poor game mechanics.",1057.8

"what i like about this game is the each classes personality and there abilities. the scout being rude, yelling at teamates to cap the point. the soldier always rocket jumping. the pyro lighting people on fire, and trying to talk to his teamates. the demoman planting stickybombs while being drunk. the heavy firing bullets everywhere and eating sandviches. the engineer making buildings to defend the intelligence. the medic healing teamates and shouting words in german. the sniper headshotting everyone who comes out of spawn. and finally the spy being a backstabbing heavies, medics, and snipers. that is what i like about team fortress 2.",2144.3

"well, for the few people left who dont play tf2, this game is awesome. the class system is great, the classes themselves are great in both personality and have a playstyle for everyone, and the weapons are mostly awesome. the sniper is for people who can aim well, the pyro brings versatility to the battlefield, the heavy soaks up damage like towel in rain, and the engineer is the class that just makes other players go crazy by killing them with a sentry gun. the best part is: 100% absolutely free. no hoops to jump through, no fees to pay, money saved. money is spent optionally. who knows if you want to, but tf2 is fun without it.",99.3

"tf2 is just a place full of people with cancer who try to rip you off.",98.1
"team fortress 2 is a deep and artistic story driven fpae ( first person artistic experience ) that is a must play for all. what starts as a typical military story about a young boy named nogames forced into a war against his will evolves into a dramatic well paced plot involving a hat conspiracy and overt religious themes. i was literaly left in tears at the twist ending. check this game out if you want a truly well written game that isnt afraid to delve into the controversial relationship human beings have with hats and religion. the only fault this game has is that it falls apart midway into the series when a new character named gaben is introduced and starts to take the light away from the more developed characters like robin. also the lead character nogames never truly matures although this is partially intended to represent the human condition of hats. either way this is a unique game and if youre not afraid to try something new and different then play tf2.",492.3

"this game is definitely part of my top 5 best games vis in this game you have 9 classes with different features, personalities, stories and of course weapons. hats plays a big role in the game, but it is completely illogical because no other fps does not have any hats :3 hats are awesome as well.",753.5
"one of the best free-to-play games out there for steam! play in a fps shooter red vs. blue with tons of items to earn! customize your character with wacky hats or such. craft weapons and earn them from achevements! also choose from over 9 different characters with their own abilites for example... the spy can go invisible and shank people behind them.. the medic well.... hes well self explaintory the scout can double jump and run fast... engineer can build turrets and teleporters and upgrade them....the sniper can get one shot kills if aimed to the head.. *critical hit* .... just so much to do in this game! what makes this game even more fun is if you play it with friends! so i think you should tell your friends to get this game if you and them do not have this wonderful game.... dont worry im not being bias about this game.. sure there might be (rarely) any issues. well for me that is.... so i give this game...... a thumbs up!",296.2

"team fortress 2 is one of the best, if not the best, game i have ever played in my life, has one of the biggest communities supporting it, and not letting it slip down into the vast pit of games people have forgotten about. even if people say, tf2 is stupid because everybody is only worrying about hats and cosnedics. still, dont judge a book (or game) by its cover. in my opinion, tf2 is so much better than any other fps game, mostly because of that theyre barely any 3 year olds playing and complaining about how this one guy keeps backstabbing him. 200000000000000000/10 (edit: and mostly always im the one doing the backstabbing...)",465.8

"this game is the best game in the world if you like class games and stuff you should play this game :p",1391.0
"well...tf2 where do i start. this game is, in my opinion, one of the best games on steam. the graphics are cartooney and it doesnt force you to make lots of microtransactions. the gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master as you never know what your opponent will do next or if theres a spy behind you, just itching to backstab. so to sum it all up, i highly reccomend this game.",213.1
"this is a very nice game. great for playing with friends. updates keep it interesting. 4.84/5 stars.",282.4
"ruined my life, took my money, and taught me to love hats. 10/10",648.1
"in order to play this game you need to remember 3 things. number 1, everyone loves pyros, play with pyros as much as you can to maximise the love. number 2, medics are great, especially combat medics who dont heal their teammates while they are busy burning to death. number 3, if you have a hat for your hat, that isnt good enough. your hats must have hats who in turn have 2 hats each, plus 1 hat. welcome to team fortress 2!!",226.2

"overall, i definitely recommend this game to anyone. with 9 versitile classes to choose from, hundreds of weapons, and an infinite number of playstyles for each class, tf2 is a highly addicting game. working as a team or simply dominating by yourself, gameplay is amazing with every class. there is another aspect other than just fighting; there is trading! many people trade on tf2 to get different types of weapons like stranges, festives, vintages, etc. and getting hats. some unusual hats can be worth hundreds of dollars! the best part of all, is that the game is free. and although you may have to buy that 99 cent giftapult to go premium, i believe i would have payed 60 dollars for this game, maybe more. thats just how awesome this game is :d",635.4

"this was a pretty fantastic game. every class has unique abilities that make them important for achieveing the objective. it was perfectly balanced. this game sucks since they added micro payments. i hate the idea of having content that actually effects gameplay that all players cannot have. i admit i do not know the full extent to how each weapon effects gameplay there are just to many. but players using the unique weapons are giving themselves an advantage or disadvantage that disrupts that balance.",153.5

"its the number one downloaded free game for a reason. its fun to play by yourself, and even more fun with friends. the monitization scheme of getting items never gets in the way of the actual game. though multiplayer games and first person shooters arent for everyone, its pace, style, and unoque mechanics make it unlike most other games within the same genre. its highly recomended, even if tis just to waste a single night. there is nothing to lose by just trying it once,",36.8

"dont base games on graphics. i did this to tf2 - i played it, but i still did it. now, what is this game about? an fps with a great community (generally) and even better gameplay, which is totally unique (more unique than your generic fps, e.g. cod/combat arms). there are constant updates (at least for a f2p game (   ) ), no pay2winning, and best of all, its free. also, hats. hats are great. you love hats and will do anything to get hats. tl;dr  game dont play 10/10 - ign",925.9
"love playing this game with friends only issue i have with the game is that players ban you for playing the game the way its supposed to be played (the team fortress 2 community is really bad) eg. i got banned from a server for cheating when all i did was capture the payload :p so when playing this game, keep in mind that if you play it the way its meant to be played then you will get banned xd",16.4
"by far the best game i have ever played i love the detil on some of the guns and hats",416.8
"there is absolutely no reason not to play this game. its the best multiplayer experience ive ever had. ever! there are unlockable weapons, but they all have downsides. the game is perfectly balanced. there is no unlockable weapon that is strait up better than the stock. this game also has a completely comunity made economy! the economy is based around metal and hats, but its too complex to write in this review. the best part is: you dont ever have to spend a penny on this game! you can get every single item in this game without spending anything. ever. its absolutely free. every weapon, hat, strange, unusual, everything can be earned, traded, or crafted. seriously, go get it. did i mention there is no levels, and no progression? its all team and skill based. when you start out, nobody is going to be statisticly better than you. its amazing, go get it. seriously, hit the download button!",612.4
"this game is epic and its free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",29.8
"this game was insanely good when it came out, balanced classes and weapons, alot of variety in a fps shooter, characters you enjoy when they shout stuff after shooting a enemy, and great valve servers, but over the years, ive seen this game plunged into darkness. first off, this game now-a-days is mostly about the hats and what is the most expensive item, pretty much trading. most games like cs:go and plenty of others are falling into this hole, having no hope of going back to once was a great and balanced game, is now full of f2ps begging for free stuff, people spamming chat with items they are trying to sell, and mothers not watching their kids play. overall, i would not recommend this game.",1764.4
"well, welcome to another valve game. its still the same as every valve game, click one to equip, but this game has come to draw me with its exploding heads and bodys and its amazing way to make you addicted. with all you little 10 year olds out there, stop playing this in game and get a life, work on homework instead of sittin in your dads office playing on a computer. theres one thing ive missed out about this game,  the graphics and gameplay, you 12 year olds should be studying for a life and get a good education from it. right now i would give this game a 1/100 for its  way of giving people things and the lag. now ive only got one more thing to say to valve, make a better in game.",54.2
"gameplay is extremly fun and balanced, with differant gamemodes changing your offensive or defensive tactics. to suceed, you have to pick a couple classes and attempt to master their position on the field. which is very fun. although f2p, tf2 could easily be considered a 15 dollar game, with a extremely stong community, helping put out updates which sometimes live up the the hype. *cough* end of the line *cough* mixing together a wonderful blend of well-rounded classes with actually interesting backstories, this game is one of my favorite games of all time. 10/10, would slap a heavy with a fish again.",490.9
"this is truly a good game my rating : 10/10 (why not 11/10 you say? ) because....... advantage: -good multiplayer -nice community -liking the graphics not too lag -nice gameplay -ongoing update disadvantage: -hats hats hats (not really hating but why its all about hats?) -n00b f2ps (well im a f2p but i know how to play) -pay2wins server",734.6

"im not much of a first person shooter lover. i often reject games like call of duty or modern warfare because they tend to just be the exact same thing in every game. however, team fortress 2 is completely different to that. the amount of creativity that has been put into this game is through the roof. i can honestly say that i have never been more addicted to anything else in my entire life.",1467.3

"a very good game. many interesting gamemodes to play, if you get tired of one you can always play another. the game is very balanced, all of the 9 classes have their own strength and weaknesses and are unique in personality and design. and unlike other shooter games new weapons arent better or worse than the stock weapons. and lets not forget that you dont have to spend a single dollar if you dont want to. it is a shame if you never tried it out.",1530.8

"the only game on steam that i have 380+ hours on....... but when the shitty community came, and taken over, then i stopped playing since i was annoyed by little bitches. this game was fine until trolling dicks had to come, pf. i recommend this if you can handle out the pressure with kids... with 7 year olds.. then this is great with you. lol. rate: 9/10",389.2

"im doing this for a badge. tf2 kicks soooo much ! although the community whines too much about updates and weapons. team fortress 2 is a lot of fun, but there are a lot of annoying players that dont realise you dont wanna trade your only valuable weapon/hat, or are 4 year olds with mics that yell,  you freaking hacker!! ill skewl you!!! yeah, thats annoying. all the classes are balanced out to fight each other equally, though people whine a lot. *coughcough the guys whining about the demo/heavy nerf cough* i will admit that i get annoyed by skilled pyros that endlessly hunt you down, or spawn camping engineers, or demoman sticky bomb spammers. but this game is amazingly fun even though the community whines too much. the graphics are great and cartoony, the characters are fregging hilarious, and the weapons are mostly balanced",687.6

"team fortress is very fun too me and i like how theres alot of new events happaned",469.7
"for how much valve caters to the casual community it might as well be called pleb fortress.",1897.6
"i love the game, one problem is that the game hounds you for cash any time it can, with most of the earnable items non-marketable (dont even think about trading until you get premium status), the game just loves microtransactions. the gameplay is really funny and easy to just pick up and get good at. i would suggest this for veterans who are tired of shooter games in general, but have not given up on the genre 8.75/10",38.2

"team fortress 2 makes people laugh and that the reason i play this game",1416.8
"there are many things that this game does correctly. for example, the balance of the classes are incredible, each class having an unique role that they do best. another thing this game does well is its form of dlc, and all it is is just a regular and a premium membership! and you can only pay .50 cents for a paid membership at the least! another thing this game does well is how social it is, i have never seen such a great community for a fps game, ever! the game types of this game is so diverse and unique, from the tower-defense-like mann vs. machine, to the classic and revised capture the flag. another thing that is wonderful about this game is the sheer goofy, cartoon-like comedy there is. it is definitely a breath of fresh air from all the gritty, super-serious modern fpss out there. this game is also very complex, heck, it even has its own trading system that feels like the stock market! it may seem like i am fanboying (which i kind of am), but i can say that this is the best f2p game ever!",584.6

"this game is the best thing since sliced bread. in fact its better than sliced bread, because it has sliced bread (see sandvich). the only problem is that sliced bread doesnt have a 7 gb file size. which is annoying, especially if you have a 10gb broadband allowance. bt will chase you with a shotgun, but the months in hospital are worth it. until you realise your hub is crap. still 10/10 though. because engies arent affected by lag (or the laws of physics) yeeeeeeee haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw!",228.5

"its a time vortex, prepare to lose all your social activites",1130.7
"a most compelling and interesting game based entirely around the concept of spending hours upon hours hoping that you will get the rare and magical item known as a hat. these hats drive most men crazy in their goal to aquire all of them. little do they know, their is no end to aquiring all of them. it is never-ending insanity that will leave a marm on your soul and haunt your dreams. i like scout because he is funny and goes all bonk!",1173.4

"team fortress 2 is a game about the most cut throat thing in human history, fashion. every aspect of this award winning game is made as an allegory to the ever changing world of fashion and the pitfalls that can befall any who wish to partake of this amazing experience. you must find hats and accessories through a random drop system that represents the elusive mistress of, inspiration. then you must find the perfect colors, names, and descriptions for your hats and accesories to set yourself apart from the other less fortunate players of the game. this would be a boring system much like the many you can find in the bland jrpgs that litter the market. what sets tf2 apart is their inclusion of a fantastic and complicated mini-game about shooting each other that blends wonderfully into the allegorical narrarative of cut throat, fast paced, deadly fashion.",1211.6

"first of all. the community is one of the worst ive seen in an online game. what tf2 needs is an unskippable tutorial or something. the servers are filled with people who dont even know the basics of the game. like that you have to capture and defend controll points and that you need teamwork to succeed(you know...in team fortress 2!). also, there are way too many pointless cosmetic items compared to equipable weapons. but still, if you happen to find players who know what they are playing, its very recommendable. also, you need to ignore trading. theres some stupid economy run by fat neckbeards going on, ignore it.",2708.7

"best fps of all time, hands down. its free, funny, balanced, simple, and hats. what more could you want? okay, so while yes, this is a great game, i would but remind you of the hats. you maybe be thinking yeah, guy, i know about the hats. whats so- unusuals. for the low, low community market price of about $100 irl (the price equivilent of 5 copies of skyrim), you too can have a flaming, triple decker hat! but really, go do it. go get a decent hat, first; nobody likes gibus wearers.

"i can not recommend this game enough! ive played it for a really long time, and it has never even once become boring. there may not be many updates to it, and its glitchy as hell, and the developers dont care about it as much anymore than they used to, it still is an incredibly fun game that you can just jump in any time you want. it might be a bit hard to get in due to all of the different weapons, classes, stats and what not (tons of stuff to remember), but once you got into it, oh man. the community isnt that bad, either. had worse experiences in dota 2... *shivers*",1273.0
"this is prehaps the best multiplayer game i have ever played! i have played it far to many hours, and it is still very fun. because of the way maps are designed and gameplay structured, all matches are fair and fun. there are also so many weapons and items to collect, even i have not collected them all. oh yeah, and its free. given all these facts, the only reason you should still be reading this is if you are waiting for the game to download because you need to get it now! amazing game!",403.7

"valve, you have sucked 200$ from my pocket from this game, its fun, creative, great comunity, i have been playing it for 1.5 years, and im doing this review for a challange",1410.3
"valves team fortress 2 is quite different from most multiplayer games that come out these days. first of all, the balance of this game is excellent. seriously. out of all the classes, the only one which comes even close to being overpowered and unbalanced is the pyro, which is terrible at long range, so probably that evens out. secondly, the humour and the classes are enough to keep anybody entertained. there are 9 classes in the game, and each one has their own unique personality and traits. i definitely recommend this game. if you havent played it yet, do so right now. its free to play, but i had bought it when orange box came out.",74.8
"so far in team fortress it has been amazing but some of the character layout are more complicated the game has a weird learning curve but once you get used to it its one of the most fun games on steam you can find",4.9

"i have owned team fortress 2 for quite a while now, but only until it was made free to play. but i couldnt figure out how to explain it for a while now... lets try this: team fortress 2 is very different. although some first person shooters are very serious, dark, etc., tf2 takes a light-hearted approach to the genre, with cartoony graphics (but bloody), many jokes and dialouge, and the darn-this-lets-attack-the-enemy-head-on feel of the game. besides the reasons i just stated above, tf2 is very, very different from other fps games. theres no leveling, exp, upgrades of any kind. instead, you do achievements to get milestones and get guns, however those guns have advantages and setbacks compared to the original gun, to be evened out. and besides, you can either pay with real money to buy the gun, or be lucky and find it while playing (youll know what im talking about when it comes around.) there are other differences, but im running out of space. d: try it yourself!",940.8
"this game is soo fun and holariously stupid i love and i think u will to :d",435.1
"would reccomend, no ifs ands or buts. team fortress 2 is amazingly addictive, and im not just talking about the gameplay aspect. the feel of rushing out in your first online payload map is unmatchable. i could only compare it to test driving a car. you are scared you may do bad, but excited just for the chance. whenever this game became f2p, the only reason not to get this game was not enough space on your harddrive, but even then i knew people who would buy a new harddrive just for this game. the shop aspect is so well implemented, and the crates are almost a lottery. there is no reason anyone should not have this game. if you dont, stop reading this and download it immediately, and prepare to immerse yourself into a world of guns, glory, and hats!",619.0

"pros: 1. game is free. 2. runs on same engine as games such as portal 2. 3. microtransactions are available, but it is set up so that every weapon has its own pros and cons(just because you buy a weapon you wont be op), and you can find and craft them all just by playing the game fairly easy. clothing and such is also available. you wont have second-class equipment if you dont buy anything. 4. can waste your life on this game like i did and then sell the stuff you find and craft for cold hard steam store credit. 5. one of the most played games on steam. has players 24/7. 6. game is fun. cons: 1. you found free fps perfection. you have nothing to look forward to in life.",358.3

"team fortress 2 is a class-based mmo + fps war-themed hat simulator for the pc and mac. originally it was a faithful recreation of the original quake and half-life mods, but has since evolved from its original design into a pointless virtual collect-a-thon where the player must collect every rare item they can by any means necessary, in order to inflate their ego and show off their e-peen. the original point of the game revolved around playing game modes such as capturing the enemy intelligence, pushing a bomb to the enemy base, or controlling a whole map by scout-rushing control points, but now all this is nothing more than a small mini-game to pass the time with while you wait for more weapons and rare items to magically drop into your inventory while doing  all on achievement, trade, idle or non-serious, fun-oriented servers. tl ; dr edition - collecting virtual hats makes you cool, and makes everybody jealous of you.",501.7

"i love this game, there is really something in it for everyone: from turning your enemies into a fine red mist with the sniper, to backstabbing people dancing the conga and even joking about drinking jarate there seems to be an endless supply of random stuff flying out of the mouths and weapons of the games unique characters. there is really no fps like it. sure console games like cod and halo have better graphics, but can you stick a rake into the head of an invisible person on cod, can you hit a person in the face with a giant neon sign on halo, i think not. as well as the brilliance of the actuall game there is, of course, a fantastic community hub that goes with it that makes this game a masterpiece. a rating of 10/10 is too little for this game and 11/10 is just copying someone elses idea so i am going to give it 134x123672637257`9829128686986986968ffssd986698968as69s8d67sa9s868/10. didnt just headbutt keyboard with excitement.",246.7

"team fortress 2 is a twist to the multiplayer fps games, as each character as some kind of special skill to their advantage. the game has the simple capture the flag and king of the hill gamemodes, it also has new gamemodes that no other fps multiplayer game has or uses. these new gamemodes are terriotorial control, payload, payload races, special delivery and the mann vs. machine mode. the weapons have four ways of being obtained which helps players get better, the first way is it being randomly dropped or given in mann-up mode for mann vs. machine, the other two are buying the items or opening crates. this game has its ups and downs, mostly with the spy class as its very hard to be sneaky with pyros around or the fact that the uber charge is great in a choke point. this games best part is finding that perfect class or weapon that really helps you in the long run. this game is a 10/10, the only problem i have is when players that are medics completly ignore you when you need them the most.",554.5

"ah, finally! the sequel to the worlds greatest lego-based shooter! now you may have heard many people call this a hat simulator, or a world of warcraft expansion and you would be right in thinking that these people are complete idiots. this game is a third person shooter. rather than adopting a lego approach, valve decided itd be better to make a game that looks like some kind of kiddie crap for casual gamers. of course there is blood, but its cartoony, and will most certainly harm your reputation if you are caught playing a game for three-year-olds. the game offers two teams: usa or russia. the russian team has a huge advantage by getting all the publicity and easy modes of play, so of course you know that they need help in winning against the worlds greatest country (usa! usa!). if you can see past the childish community and graphics, i actually recommend that you buy this game, but only so you can watch a violent cartoon for big kids.",1839.7

"unlike common fps games, team fortress 2 brings a more comedic and playful environment to players and fans. the unrealisticness allows for different features not possible in real life such as explosive jumping, double jumping, building motion sensored sentries just by repeatedly hitting it with a wrench, becoming invincible and other methods to help massacre the opposing team. along with playing the game, there is more to just killing others to win. to shame your enemies and please your now-dead employers (redmond and blutarch mann), help capture a paper-spilling briefcase full of information, take control of points, or explode the enemy base. different characters & different weapons allow you to fit your playing style whether itd be towards mobility, heavy damage, or even an assisting distraction. overall, the game is not limited to one form of gameplay, and you are likely to find ways to make it more enjoyable whether itd be in vanilla game modes, new weapons, modded servers, or even hats!",1410.4

"not just another mindless shoot em up fps like most games, team fortress 2 offers unique bonuses to each class, giving it a slight rpg feel, as certain classes can counter others, such as spy beats engineer, pyro beats spy, heavy beats pyro. many feel as though classes like the engineer are over powered, the only one thats over powered is the scout, as he can deal high amounts of damage, while circling around you, avoiding being hit, what makes it worse, he has an item, to literally, make him untouchable for a short period of time, not even a level three sentry, which can take a heavy, head on, can touch a scout who drank bonk, and with the new update, scouts who have the newest weapon, are even more over powered, scouts are already hard to hit, and can easily get behind you, and the new weapon deal bonus damage from behind for the scout!",300.7

"it does hurt not to recommend this game after ive spent so much time on it, but i just cant recommend it anymore. the last updates prove that the tf2 development team is just not in touch with the game anymore, the awful optimization issues make this game unplayable, sometimes even for people who have great computers, and the community is slowly dying. people are moving on to cs:go and dota 2, just like me. i really do feel like tf2 is dying. hopefully a source 2 port and a competitive matchmaking update can fix these problems.",2403.8

"probably in the top 10 for my favorite games of all time easily. so many modes, some fun mods... well structured classes with their own deep backstories. humorous. not to mention that the balance and diversity of weapons is great. no overpowered weapons. trading in this game adds a whole new dimension for some people. i dont trade for profit anymore. why not give it a shot? its free. if you take a liking to it i would highly reccommend going premium. i didnt go premium until i hit 200 hours though. it was definetly worth the 49 cent investment. definetly. i later went on to play competitive tf2, which i found increasingly fun compared to the pubs in which i was dominating the rest of the server. i think valve should add a match making/ rank system in tf2. it would really help the game garner more attention as an e-sport. i think the problem is that with out these built in features, few people know about competitive at all. plz valve plz i give it a pineapple out of a guava",1115.3

"team fortress 2- absolutely no words can express what i feel about this game. main reason is i have mixed feelings about this game. its a great first person shooter game, with many servers allowing you to customize your character. the downside to this game is the creators will to continuosly aim the game towards a money-making process. so much of this game is money-oriented, its quite sad and ruins the cartoonish aspect the game provides. but besides that, this is one great game that would not disappoint. through the hours i have logged, i have spent countless hours playing competitively, casually, and even just sitting there and helping coach other players. its a fun game, and i really do love the time playing it. the cartoonish feeling and effect has a major voice in my opinion. reason being is just that after coming home from a long day of work, the cartoonish characters, with all their personalities, is a real pleasure to see. would recommend you get it.

"used to be a very good class based shooter. now its just a cosmetic item showcase (especially hats). in my opinion they added too much variation on gear. imagine if dota started as it is now, but then added interchangable skills for each character. would make it way more complex, yes, but would make balance even harder to achieve. now imagine if not everyone had access to those skills on release of this hypothetical update, but instead had to either trade for them, earn them through random drops, or straight-up buy them from valve. thats what happened to tf2.",137.8

"i have to say, team fortress 2 is one of the very few shooters that i enjoy. i have been playing for over a year now and the game offers a lot of action, humor and fun! and of course, lets not forget the hats, never forget the hats. in my opinion, they need to make a few weapons better. for example, the quick-fix; a medi gun that heals very quickly, but only over-heals you about 50% while other medi guns heal about 125%, seems like a good combination right? problem is its bercharge does not make you invunerable or gives you critical hits, it only heals even quicker. what i think they should do for the bercharge is it should last even longer than the normal bercharge. overall, this game is fun to enjoy and play with friends. i highly recommend this game.",2781.2

"team fortress 2 is one of the finest games ive played for a long time. the class based warfare, unlike all other games of its type, is more fun than being one of the many militaristic shooters we see too much of today. fish, human urine, invisibility watches, icicles, ninja swords, and shards of volcanic rock make it into the huge roster of weaponry, with hundreds(!) more to be found at random points when playing. if you dont think you should buy it, you dont have to; you can play tf2 for free, but you wont have as much fun as when you play it premium. so, i highly recommend this game, for its deviation from the modern-day generic first-person military shooty swearathon ixvvvix! style of play.",1202.1

(just dont waste your money, is what im trying to say) team fortress 2 is full of possibilities, such as weapons and cosmetics, just to name a few. the moral of the game is two brothers fighting of what they believe will fuel the world, so they employ mercs to do the fighting for them. im not going to go into anymore details by myself, because you can find out and create a opinion of this great game.",304.0

"at the time of this review, i have played about 530 hours of this game. i have enjoyed every second, whether i would prefer to admit it or not. the feeling you get by firing any weapon and getting a kill is enough to go back again and again. unlike counter-strike, the weapons are very cartoonish and the game is just a joke that makes you want to laugh in a mans face when they are pinned against a wall due to an arrow. the animations are, to say the least, hilarious the first time i saw them. i recommend this game for if you have a few hours to kill, or a few people. i also like to land on some peoples head after a rocket jump and make a poop noise. but thats just me. if you like realistic shooters, this game is not for you. if you are used to clicking on people, this game is not for you. if you are an fps player who yearns for something different, this game is defienitly for you. cheers. oh, and there are also a few bugs and hackers too. 9.9/10",668.4

"i was only 3 when it started. my hat collection consisted of a backburner until one day the gibus dropped. this gibus was the best thing that happened to me, it touched me more than jimmy saville, more than snips dog touches him, more than anything. we used to sit together and talk about how many faze videos we watched that day. but then my gibus met a new hat, the pyrovision goggles. i didnt sleep for 5 years. i was a ruin. however there was a light at the end of the tunnel, i found the new game brats passion for fashion, it changed me completely. i left my career as the number one unicorn breeding meth grinder and began my adventure in fashion, starting by selling both my lungs to buy the game. now my fashion career has brought me to some  company who dont care for their games. 10/10 would bang again",2018.2

"team fortress 2, seems like such an understatement when i say i recommend this. its probably my favorite game of all time with over 2000 hours logged on it. even though people may not like the hats and new items, personally i think thats what keeps this game alive. every time the game feels like its getting boring or repetitive, they add something new that makes the game feel fresh and fun. this is the only game i think id ever give a perfect 10/10, because the games always expanding. the community on the other hand, is quite a lot like the sonic fanbase, and ill just leave it at that. in conclusion, if you havent played this game before, do it; i cannot stress that enough, download it and play it. its free, but i highly recommend buying something in it at some point in time.",2481.4

"this game is extremely fun and highly addictive. the only downside is that the players who bought the game before it was free are really butthurt. if you are a free-to-play player, it is likely that the paid players will be on your  and treat you like youre the new kid in class. my advice: ignore them. theyre just silly people who are butthurt that they had to spend money and you didnt. arguements are easy to get into in this game, so youre best option is to just play the game and avoid all communications unless someone seems really nice. :3 gameplay wise, you can never go wrong in this game (unless dealing with hackers). the game is incredibly balanced so that even if youre a new player using default weapons, you can still land yourself on the top of the scoreboard. just dont get cocky. people dont like that. have fun, be nice, and you may be rewarded with some sweet gear. 9/10 it was okay",356.2

(2fort) (i started playing when it was quake team fortress back in 99). i enjoy being able to customize my character now with cosmetics because it gives a sense of uniqueness to your character. i enjoy going demoman and decapitating a plethora of players. if you enjoy non-sense, funny dialogue from characters, non-stop mayhem, a very well-balanced game for the most part, doing conga lines, etc. this is the game for you.",2773.1

"other than recieving one of the highest metascore rating of all time and being a near perfect game, this game is the best you can ever buy, for free! to start, the game is a team based fps that focuses on objective based gameplay rather than straight tdm (although there is that gamemode). now that may sound very unoriginal, but what this game does almost flawlessly is the classes that are present in the game. given nine classes to choose from, the player can adapt their gamestyle at a moments notice, throwing the enemy for a loop or helping the team fill in desperately needed roles. each class has its obvious strengths and weaknesses, with no class being too difficult to kill by any other one. on top of all this, the official maps are also near perfect, with ways around everything but also ways to defend everything, giving the game a nice flow as well as a good challenge. the only downside i can see in this game is some of the community, but like any other game, that should not be held against it.",816.5

"+the game is a fun fps with multiple classes to vary up your play style and changes the way it is from other fpss, then it just being a point and shoot with the regular fps guns: smg, sniper, assualt rifle, etc. but tf2 adds a more expansive take with weapons: flamethrower, minigun, sentries, etc. id say this game is worth it since its been pretty active for 8 years. (to this date) -although the game has multiple hats, misc. etc. for you to wear on your characters, and different types of weapons (genuine, vintage, strange, etc.) with along the trading the comes along with this game and can get you into a fuss over wanting an item for a long time and then going into the habbit of buying everything from either the mann co. store or the steam market. this game will consume your money more then pickpocketers in europe. although the game is a new a fun fps with still 8 years of active people and with the downfall of trading i still give this game a.. 9/10",1367.9

"the first hours of tf2 were fine and fun, but as time passed things slowly got worse until i started playing saxton hale. i stuck with it for almost 2000 hours. then i returned to regular tf2 it was very bad, teams were always premiums vrs f2p, i didnt find this fun or fair at all even as i was on the winning team it didnt feel very good. this is how tf2 is nobody wants to play fair all they want to do is win, until valve puts proper team balancing on default servers tf2 will remain to be garbage to me. clan servers ive joined were a joke, ive been ghosted as a spy, and ive caught cheaters on video before that didnt even receive a slap on the hand. but with all this at least the mods like prophunt *only fun when you play with newbies*, saxton hale *some servers dont have proper class balancing and very abusive owners* these are the only things id consider fun to play in tf2",2648.6

"a great game. i havent found anyhackers and have passed 30 hours for game record. my only problems are 1-i dont find many items and when i do they are ones i already have, 2-you come against people who have way better stuff then you because they spend real money to get ahead and 3-crafting, i smelt weapons into metals and when you get enough for a weapon it says you need blue prints-how do you get them!!!! i like the gameplay style and there aredifferent servers and gamemodes to suit any one. all in all, i think it is a great game to kill time adn is enjoyable. 8/10 stars",161.2

"team fortress 2 has the most balanced classes around with some being more for new players and others being for the more experienced. take the sniper. the sniper is the easiest class in the game and it is extremely easy to use. it is recommended to try and shoot the body and not the head, as it does almost the same amount of damage. the pyro however, is almost impossible to master and the people who are able to use it well have been called w+m1-ers. this stands for win+medic1, because a pyro and a medic are almost unstoppable and can win the game if the pyro has any decent amount of skill. the heavy is also one of the harder class, and the win+medic1 also applies to it. there are many great game modes and maps, but i love deathmatch on 2fort myself.",164.1
"this game is a ton of fun, very addicting. a great thing about this game is it is not your ordinary everyday shooter with its creative art style and fun gameplay. one of the most amazing parts of this game is that it doesnt cost any (not pay to win either)",33.8
"i have played tf2 since february 2012, and ever since its kind of been one of those games; oh, i dont know what to do. i might just play tf2. a lot of people (including some of my friends) said that this is just one of those pay-2-win games but it really isnt. weapons drop for everyone, randomly. you dont need hats or freaking unusuals to win a match, youre just good at the game. most of my friends that play tf2 think that players who wear gibuses and pyrovision goggles are just plain failure, but i was like that too. nowadays theres this impression that if a player has premium on tf2 (which btw you can get it by just purchasing one item in the shop) theyre immediately very good at the game... its not like that. i have some complaints though. unofficial premium servers; thats right, saigns. those are pay-2-win servers. never play in one of these. blacklist all of them.",814.0
"team fortress 2 is a fun and addictive game and im glad its free to play. even though you have to purchase one item in the mann co. store in order to get a premium account, its not a big deal. each class in tf2 feels different and unique which destroys repetition. there are also many different kinds of weapons to chose from. you can also add hats and costumes to your character as you go on. the item drop in tf2 is a good idea except that you get a lot of crates which will force you to buy a key at the store. steam workshop also adds more uniqueness to the classes by people adding more weapons and costumes. one big reason why i like tf2 is because it never gets old. i would highly recommend this game to people especially because it is free-to-play.",600.6
"team fortress 2. is an amazing cartoonish themed first person shooter. what really cought my eye when playing it was all the differant classes. they each have unique talents. i really love the item trading. there is a whole system for team fortress 2 items. for example. 1 scrap metal can be traded for 2 weapons. that kind of thing. seeing how team fortress 2 is a free game you really should get it! the graphics: 8/10 the voice acting: 9.5/10 the objectives: 8.5/10 the gameplay: 9/10 the music: 8/10 the overall game: 9/10 i would deffinantly reccomend this game to others!",428.2

"team fortress 2. tf2. call it what you want, but itll always be my favorite game. tf2 is a team-base shooter game about a butt-load of different game modes. payload is a popular one, i like this one best because its more of a team-based effort, instead of an mvp. attack/defense is my next favorite, same thing, encourages teamwork. ill leave you to decide the remaining game modes. i recommend this game if youre into first person (or third-person for that matter) cartoon-ish shooting games. p.s. best map imo: trade_abstract2 p.p.s. higher nation ftw p.p.p.s. im not on crack you dingus -.-",1118.2

"having played this game for a while now, i felt that i should reveiw it. now this game i loved when i started playing and still play it more. not only just killing each other in an animated world of comedy and mindless killing, you can find hats and paints to somewhat change your apperance in game and craft other things that can be rare or just have fun in a conga line. this game almost always has surprised me, the only problem i have seen are the tryhards who just want to ruin your fun and enjoyment.",593.8

"i just got this game for fathers day and let me tell you this game is probably the best first person shooter to date. it is so realistic you feel like you are really congaing or on the battlefield. sometimes i find myself congaing in real life because i confuse tf2 and real life because they are just so similiar.",2580.6

"hats. must collect hats. oh, and the shooting part is cool. but its a shideshow to the hats.",170.8
"this game is free and yet it is one of the most popular games on steam. that says something. i definitely recommend playing tf2 or at least trying it out. however, i believe that to fully enjoy this game you cannot play for a short period of time. the reason for this belief is that when i first started playing tf2, i played for around an hour and didnt really like it. however, i decided to try playing again a month after my first try and i slowly began to enjoy it. over time i began to understand how to play as each of the characters and i unlocked many game changing items. tf2 is fairly easy to play once you get used to it, but when you first start playing, its like entering a whole new world. tf2 is unlike any other game and it will take a bit of time to fully understand it, but once you do, it becomes one amazingly fun multiplayer game.",291.5
"awesome game, easy to play. tip: turn mouse sensitivity to the max= better gameplay",505.2
"a very enjoyable, but not perfect game. for 2007, this game is doing very well as it is constantly being updated and modded, proving it can stand the test of time. the graphics arent great, but for running on a game published in 2007, they can be quite impressive. with many different game modes and items, this game offers tons of variety and replay value. i recommend it.",2453.5

"maybe you played at launch, maybe not. maybe you were a former player who felt alienated because of all the hats and other nonsense and gave it up. whatever the reason was i recommend returning to this great game. sure it got ridiculous with all the hats and other nonsense but its still hella fun. i know i was one of those people who moaned and groaned when this game became f2p. but i gave in downloaded and am having a blast. so in short, wanna shoot  up and have some fun? i highly recommend this.",613.7

"this game... it is really fun i dont play it anymore, but it is really well balanced and teamwork helps you alot! there are in-game items that people create and valve adds them if you get enough votes! i quit this game because i was bored. this game has a really cool economy, and you make make profit just by playing for a little bit. i spent so much money in this game i bought lots of items. i would give it a 8/10. it is also highly addictive if you want a cool non-serious game where a guy eating a sandwich can turn around and kill you with a mini-gun try this game!",2413.1

"best. fps. ever. tf2 has everything, classes that play completely different than one-another, a crap ton of weapons for each class, and hats, and hats. i think this is what cod and battlefield need, none of those games have different play styles when you get a new weapon, sure it changes what you fire, but it doesnt give you a completely different way to play, like the spy with the cloaking device, or the medic with the ubercharge. with tons of load-outs you can pick from it has tons of replayability, and hats. it is an obligation to get this game if you havent already, because it is completely free, so get it now!!!!! ...hats......",275.9

"its a game about fighting other people while wearing crazy costumes and using the most random things as weapons. once you start, you cant stop until you make your friends rage quit.",243.4
"everything good about this game as already been said but regardless its a good game has guns n classes. this game you could be a team player or a lone wolf and theres a class for each and anyones play style but best to test each class for yourself. one problem is the outrageous prices for stuff just to find out its alot less than what you traded for so if your not being ripped off by a player your just supplying valve with more money than they need. overall is amazing and the custom maps and gamemodes not to mention skins and sounds you can mod in makes the game all the more enjoyable.",1338.7
"team fortress 2... in a word? amazing. this game has so many unique aspects to it such as crafting, weapon finding, and multiplayer glory. conquer territory in hundreds of different ways! whether it be capturing a flag, taking controll points, or even pushing a payload equipted with a bomb! different loadouts mean more possible combinations to rule everyone! this game is by far one of my favorite games ever made. on a scale of 1-10 i have made some of my opinions. creativity: 9 variability: 10 addictivity: 8 my love: 11 have fun with your newly download tf2! :)",1350.1

"its a fat guy who has a mini gun who doesnt like this its made out of fat people",1627.1
"this game its just the best i ever played (my opinion). with the trading system, the community market gets realy exiting when u get to grow up ur fortune. the gameplay itself can not be described untill u play the game, try it if u dont play already, go ahead and play 3 hrs. ull get addicted.",1818.4
"this game possibly hits the greatest multiplayer gaming ever. no matter how fun it is. the hats are actually great to use. blame the people who dont recommend the game. i recommend it because its useful for everything. and its like worms, (because in worms, you wear hats too) thats why. its also amazing how much the game got popular. obviously. its the most amazing game in the world. you now shoot babies and show them, who is crying.",1804.6

"team fortress 2 is a good game that i would recommend to anyone who wishes to get into the world of steam. this game should run nice on pretty much any modern day computer. the game features 9 different classes that you can aquire items and gear for via the item drop system. there is micro-transactions with these item in the man-co store but i personally wouldnt use but the option is there. i think that this game overall is a good free title that if you have an extra ten gigs to use i would think about picking this up.",154.5
"ahh tf2 a great game, also a free to play. a great game with 9 classes and more importantly hats. tf2 is a team game where you have to work together and complete an objective. there are 10 game modes (including mann vs. machine) and loads of maps. the classes are awesome and theres 9 too, scout, soldier, pyro, demo man, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy. then theres mann vs. machine were you kill robots. then theres the best part hats.",699.9

"my money... where has is all gone!?!?!? if you got friends or want to make friends, this is the game for you. best game for playing with friends or finding people who could be your friend. lovely game, there is pretty much only. this game needs alot of strategy and it is really fast paste with scouts jumping/running everywhere, demomen flying across the map, and soldiers jumping from wall to wall. the best part are the hats but you will find out why people love hats later.. tip: do not buy from the mann co. store, instead, go to a website called backpack.tf",1385.3
"this is easily one of my favorite first person shooters. even better, its free...",255.0

"definitly a fun game, one of my favourites. everything is free to play unless you want pay-to-play to trade, buy items from the market, and play mann up mode (which you must buy tickets for) overall i would rate this game 9/10 for good quality, not too many bugs, tons of different gamemodes and a large selection of classes for different maps and tasks.",582.7
"a good game,i really like the atmosphere here,u can have a lot of fun in this game.too may charactors with there special abilities,no. of weapons just makes it awesome",71.8
"disregard everything that says its free to play, because trust me, you are going to spend at least several aaa games worth of money buying keys, unboxing, getting pissed off you got a strange crit-a-cola instead of a shiny unusual, wising up, and using your keys to buy wonderous cosmetics so you can have a soldier that looks like a drill sargeant or a racially offensive demoman. although these cosmetics dont have any impact on your play (according to valve, at least; some believe they make you better at the game, myself included), they have an impact in the real world; you entering a dark downward spiral in which you feel obligated to spend all your dosh on pixels in the hopes someone on gorge will tell you nice hat. its like a black hole in that once you enter, you cant turn back. your life is forever ruined, and you are a hollow husk of your former self. its a phenomenal experience, 10/10.",2106.8
"this is an awesome game! i love it i got addicted to it pretty fast. i didnt like 1st person shooters games, but something about this game got me into it. thank you valve for making this amazing game!",812.7
"i highly recommend this game, mainly because theres so much more to do that just battle both teams on one server. there are custom game modes that players have created that make this game very unique and enjoyable. there is an amazing trade system which allows players to trade items in the game to others that you can carry over to other servers and use. not to mention the rare quality items that are rare that everyone wants, such as unusuals. the team fortress 2 community has even created their own currency for this game! this game uses metal as the main source of money to trade among others. theres just too much to explain about this, youll have to download and play for yourself!",815.0

"a great game for a great price, it has really fun game modes and gameplay rivaling and even beating call of duty and battlefield in some aspects, the majority of the community is great. and for some reason hats are addictive, i told myself when i started playing i would just stick with drops and f2p account but next day i got hooked on mvm and well ever since its been true love with this game. love it and i recommend it to anyone with two hands, its free so if you dont like it you can easily uninstall also great for people with low spec computers or people who just cant afford to buy alot of games 10/10",623.4

"team fortress 2 is a first - person shooter that millions of people have played. you can customize yourself with hats, shirts, weapons and so on. although you have to pay real world money for hats or trade. if you are free - to - play, dont bother the insults premiums throw at you. youre here just to have fun, right? well, who am i kidding. why recommend this game when you should have already gotten it? score: 10/10 stars. although once you had your fill of fun, you have to play other games otherwise tf2 will soon get boring.",613.6

"the best hat simulator to date - this game features a large assortment of headgear and other wearables in a variety of styles and colours. with the ability to trade, purchase and stash away pixels in a virtual backpack, you can finally feel comfortable knowing that youve wasted your life. and once you have completed your worthless collection of wearable items, you can show them off to other pathetic losers in-game. you can also express your poor creativity by naming, describing and painting your items with a large array of bland, depresssing colours. become a true jew by repeatedly attempting to make miniscule profit off of hour-long trades! oh, and you can also shoot stuff. a must-buy for all basement dwellers and fat losers; 10/10.",1184.4

"wouldve recommended this game a couple years ago when 90% of the community wasnt traders and actually played the game. game is slowly dying and valve is probably going to leave it soon anyway. dont bother yourself with the 8gb+ download. go play something better, like counter-strike.",1564.6

"valve delivers another great fps; they manage to almost seamlessly mix the genre with online play in a way other games havent perfected before. their classes add a wider depth of skill that needs to be used to adapt and assist your team to win. they manage to give you the option for free online play but still compel you to spend money at the store; i can honestly see why they still make good money off this game. most complaints i hear about this game are usually server side and cant be helped by any programming. anyone who goes in should as always be aware of getting ripped off while trading, there are a lot of malicious people out there and everyone should be aware. if youre really not sure there are a lot of websites that other sources you can use to help. for everything else though just turn your mic receive volume down, your sprays on and just have some good tf2 mindless fun.",343.4
"a game that is worth downloading is defenatley this one. normally i would expect a game like this to have a pricey cost but this is free to play. this game is a stardigizing, sort of fast, contains some comedy, dont rage quit, and be epic. there is alot of basics and theries to over view but it is fun. this game consists of in-game purchases and nine classes. offense - scout soldier pyro | defense - demoman heavy engineer | support - sniper medic spy some classes are difficult to get started with, but soon youll thank valve for creating all of this. thanks for reading this. i highly recomend this game.",524.1

"it has great trading and a large economy but the gameplay is unbarable. you cant go into a server without a bunch of idiots. the balence is horrific, they put all the horrible players that have played for a few minutes on one team and the rest on the other team. i dont know if i should recommend this game or not. once this gem of a game became f2p, it is now a piece of garbage if you ask me. trading is the only thing that is keeping me going.",1214.2

"the true definition of horror games. no...this is not your everyday reimagining of resident evil 5 and above. this is a horror game that aims to catch players off guard at the worst of times, such as waiting for a four string astunando to cease, then proceed to reveal scares. you wont find cheesy jump scares here.",149.3

"this game is a fps shooter that has a cartoony feel to it while also obtaining the more than major ctf, control point and a bunch of other game types that you can enjoy playing by yourself or with a freind or entourage of other people. personally i recommend this game not only because its free but its a fun way to waste time while waiting for things and the amount of accessories in this game is absurd but more than fun to collect. ysmir017",125.9

"10/10: beyond recommended! the only game ive seen so far where the characters have more depth to them, without having a single player campaign to tell each individual story. what was once a simple class-based multiplayer fps, has turned into a game that has new weapons, wearable hats, and has amassed the ability to market said items and create an economy for itself using the law of supply and demand.the game expands more and more each update. did i mention, its free? its obvious that i dont need to, but i couldnt understand what would stop someone from not playing this.",1785.3

"of all the 300 odd games i have, ive played this one more than all the others combined (as of 7/2013), which says a lot about this games quality and replayability. in my opinion its one of the best tycoon games ever, as you work your way up the ladder of hats and unusuals, but instead of earning money proportional to the quality and quantity of your hats, you have to play a cute fps minigame to earn basic items, that you can use to trade your way up to more hats. this is an interesting take on the tycoon formula, but puts more focus on economy and trading, and obviously works well for this game. 10/10, would wear hats again.",484.9
