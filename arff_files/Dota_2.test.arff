(i have played bf 3, bf 4, every dead island, a lot of strategic games and wow etc... i also played lol, but dota ... dota 2 is more difficult than lol, lol is for kids who want kill everything and destroy everything, but dota is more strategic and just it is more about how can you plan assaults, how you can farming...) dota is about cooperate, but lol is also about that, than why play dota? play it if you want challenge and a lots of hour of fun. its amyzing guys play it! :-)",1234.4

"one of the best games i have ever played and it is unbelievable",282.3
"dota (defense of the ancients ) is a action rts game, a great esports platform, a fun game to play if you just know the mechanics of this great game. 10 random players choose from a strong hero pool with different powers and the players have to cooperate with each other understand the extremities of the game. leadership,forgivness,sacrifice and great strategy is required for the win or you end up losing and wasting an hour or two. the only drawback is a steep learning curve but when finally you learn this game you will just love this and play all day. it is also a great way to connect with players of the world a large community supports this, so a word of advice play hard die hard go pro.",1307.9

( or at least, that is my case ). but still, the design of characters, effects and models, compared to the ones from dota 1, are fascinating. i really like the new heroes look. plus, its not like you really have to pay for useful weapons and items. you can buy things in-game, in map shops to strengthen your hero, and even your team. i really give this game a high ranking!",20.4

"possibly one of the most interesting games in my steam library, dota 2 is an enjoyable game to play with friends online and meet new people in the online matches. after the recent success of the internations 2014 by raising a whopping prize pool of over ten million dollars. this serves as an incentive for new players at the possibility to winning a share of the prize pool if theyre good at the game. one will require the ability to quickly respond to the situation as the actions of your teammates and enemies are completely random. i suggest this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable experience thats more complicated than the similar game league of legends. i find both games equally fun and enjoyable however dota is ultimately the more superior game between the two. ~samuraizheng",1069.1

"dota 2 is one of the best games out there. it is a massive rage factory, and you will hear insults come out of your mouth that you didnt even think you knew. you can play powerful heroes, like a succubus with a pain fetish, or a massive red man who loves to splatter people into numbers. also, the learning curve is best described as a learning cliff. but whatever i tell you doesnt matter, because you people read the reviews for comedy, rather than purchasing information.",864.7

"after playing over 1000 hours of this game, i would love to say that valve have done an amazing job working with icefrog to create a game that, although objectively the same each time, is engaging and extremely dynamic every time. screams of joy and frustration will be heard when you play this game, maybe you will develop an unrelented hatred for the russian people or simply call mid or feed. all i can say is, i am glad i took the time to get past dotas steep learning curve for it has been a rewarding experience that i am looking forward to continue for many months to come.",3144.2

"cant stop for playing this game, high recommended!",1248.4
"warning: dota 2 causes crack-like addiction; including increased heart rate, serious rage, unstoppable laughter and inability to call it a night after a  defeat. when playing alongside a great and coordinated team vs a great enemy team, it doesnt get much more intense or fun. if you havent started playing yet, find some friends who already do and get on the train.",686.0

"if you are new to mobas.... go to league of legends to get your foot in the waters, because this game is hardcore and complex. put in simple this is high risk/ high reward. fail 2 or three times, the match favors the other team. there will be frustrating moments, but after you past the learning curve, this game is very addicting. only watch the pro plays on youtube after you already get a feel of what dota is about, and you will be amazed at the things the pro players are able to pull off.",1099.8
