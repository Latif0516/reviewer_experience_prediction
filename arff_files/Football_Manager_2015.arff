"ive bought this game for many years and think this might be my last. firstly im not keen on spending 30 a year on something that could be released as an update. the lack of competition in the manager genre has made si very lazy, to the point where they make one or two small changes and market it as a new game. here are some of the points where my problems lie -ridiculous injurys, in my first season there was not one point where i didnt have at least six players injured -how many times in real football does a team make all its subs then a player gets injured and they finish the game with 10 men? well in fm about one in three games but amazingly never to the computer opponent -its almost impossible to generate any momentum anymore in fm, you will be playing well then suddenly lose for no reason -football has always been in the headlines for footballers astronomical wages, thank god its not like fm, youth players who have never made a first team appearance asking for 40k! agents of average players asking for 5mill in fees! -instead of improving things like the ability to see how your players have performed in training during the week to help your decisions on who to play si add tunnel interviews?!? i can imagine the meeting at si so what have the fans on the forums been asking for well their all desperate for more press interviews in the game, they just dont feel theres enough as fans of the series we should treat si like an alchoholic relative and not hand over money to them to continue their bad habits, in this case their bad habits being treating fans like cash-cows that they can just make sub-standard games for and rely on fan loyalty",237.9
"i have played every iteration of the football manager series, long before i even used steam and i have to say that football manager 2015 has some of the most glaring issues i have seen within the series. manager customization has been inserted and is a step in the right direction, but not entirely. so, you will get to customize the stats of your manager. are you more laid back or more technical? the option to customize and edit stats as such as adaptability and understand of things like attacking, defensive, etc are there. however, i dont entirely know what impact they have on the game as in my 9 hours of playing i havent really noticed it or came across them again. i also do not know if these stats improve or worsen over time, depending on what you do - as the game does not tell you, even in the very brief tutorials. the new user interface layout is amazing and is long overdue. i actually found that i stopped playing football manager 2014 because of the ui. it was clunky, it was a mess and i had no idea where anything was. it was all just text and drop down menus. now there is a nice sidebar which provides links that take you to the most important and most used parts of the game as such as tactics, scouting, team, etc. purchasing players is odd this year. sometimes it is extremely easy to buy a player and others extremely difficult, for no reason - even if you are trying to purchase an already transfer listed player or a reserve player getting no games at his current club. the old let me pay 100m on a 48 month deal still works. you can buy any player that wants to come to your club if you use this method and it totally breaks the entire game. my biggest gripe and the sole reason why i need to give a bad recommendation to this game: the ai and the match engine. the ai in football manager 2015 is the worst i have ever seen in the series. if you actually sit and watch the match unfold you will see some of the following: - players running for a ball and stopping for no reason - the goalkeeper saving the ball, standing back and staring at the ball, which is touching his feet - a player will chase the ball down the wing at full speed, slow down and allow a opposing team player to catch up and take the ball. - opposing team player has the ball and stands still. all of your players are polite enough to let him stand still. - outrages tackles: ball is moving out of your box, opposing striker is running out of your box. there is no threat. defender will slide tackle him as he is leaving the box and give away a penalty. - cbs that seem to play as strikers, leaving entire gaps in your defence. red cards, injuries and own goals - everywhere. i have not went through a game yet where there has not been at least one own goal either by my team or the opposing team. they are everywhere. red cards and injuries happen in abundance - i have had 10 players injured within the first month of a season even though i had average training and not too many games in quick succession. tactics do not work as they are intended. if you sit down and take the time to read and learn how to create tactics, you will be so frustrated. the game gives you descriptions of what each position and instruction does, in depth. this is great. however, they do not work as they say. short passing, retaining position and not punting the ball up the park? team constantly just fires the ball all over the park with next to no short passing. push higher up the park? team sits deep. because of these issues, scorelines can be ridiculous. in my first 5 games of the season there was a combined number of 30 goals between me and the other team. my first game finished 5-4 and my second was 6-3. this all leads to a very frustrating experience overall. every year si always say we are improving the match engine. where are these improvements? i have not seen any improvements, just more bugs and terrible ai. i love this series and i am a huge football fan, but i feel obliged to tell fellow consumers not to purchase this product until it vastly improves.",113.0
"ive been a huge fan of fm going way back before the big split that led to championship manager and football manager. since i started this game, ive won the league once and the treble in another season. im in my fourth season. so its not like im whinging because i cant win. but there is clearly something wrong with the matchday engine. the most succinct way i can put it is that its like theyve decided brazil vs germany from the last wc is commonplace. ill keep 8 straight clean sheets (or something like that) then get beaten by a promoted side 6-0, or 7-5! whats more, ive noticed other games in the league finishing 8-6, and stuff like that. since i started counting, in three seasons ive seen goalkeepers chipped from the touchline or from inside the defending half 27 times!!! the game needs a lot of work. its a winning franchise; so, all they need to do is fix it. but dont spend your money on it until they do. they have released a very dodgy product. ive never seen an fm release like it. just makes the game seem ridiculous, even when youre winning. and thats not why people play this game, right?",1138.7
"there are some good things about fm 2015 which might make it interesting for someone who has never played the series before. for me, as a pretty hardcore player, i feel like im in a vicious circle just feeding my malcontent about the game, but cannot break my addiction. and hell, ive had many spells of fm addiction throughout the last fifteen years, but they are only truly rewarding when i feel i can make a difference with my particular style of play. and my preferred scenario is the lower league model, excessive scouting, wheeler dealer kind of approach, which is worth very little in 2015. the thing that works the least, for me, is that i dont feel i can truly play the game the way i would want to play it. my expectation is that somehow getting a few amazing players in a league 2 or conference team should show. but whether it shows or not depends on chance, player ratings are very position dependent, with central midfielders taking the runt of bad ratings, however amazing they may seem. so i might spend hours searching for the coolest prospects i can find, fishing for work permits for my non-eu conquests, but getting phenomenal players on a mediocre squad matters very little. the general feeling is of a wooden game. bizarre things happen which seem to defy reason. some are buggy, like goalkeeper reactions, some are fixable via lengthy tactical tinkering, like defending corners, and others are the worst of all: monotonous. long distance goals? maybe on tv. a fast player outrunning a defender unless the latter fumbles it? keep dreaming. half competent goalkeepers seem harder to find than the proverbial needle. and then theres an aggressive randomness to how a team behaves and matches unfold. my concede within the first ten minutes syndrome seems unshakable. i am not saying it cannot be done, but the feeling is that it is something that needs to be fixed from the get go, rather than something that should be reasonably fine under normal conditions, like corners. and when theres a huge quality gap between your players and the opposition, it all gets hard to fathom. so why have i played hundreds of hours of this? on the one hand, the addiction. on the other, that elusive feeling when things actually do go right and you win an amzing match. but i am left frustrated because fm seems to be going nowhere, the development of the game fails to address key issues year after year. a balanced match engine. a bit of flair and a bit of the unexpected. some character and individuality to the players. unbiased ratings. consistency and logic in the transfer system. of course its not easy and theres a lot of back and forth in trying to get it all together, but considering the heritage of this series, i cannot avoid a distinct sensation of complacency, padded with the occasional ui revamp or a couple of shiny new features. bottom line: if you have not played this yet, maybe wait it out some more, like until si decide to take the bull by the horns and create another classic. there are many people who enjoy working on this game and its database is a treasure trove, an inimitable advantage for anyone interested in joining the fray. the risk with taking it up is that even if you get it for free, time costs incurred are not worth the experience and chances are your passion for football will be your downfall, in spite of this.",194.2
"too realistic. my arsenal team is getting too many injuries.",372.3
"ive played every single football manager game since the split from championship manager and every single championship manager before that and i have to say, this is the first time ive been massively disapointed in the series - it doesnt feel like fm, its a skewed imposter. some things around the game has improved in subtle ways - match day stadiums looks great, the scouting is more realistic than ever but the good ends there. the matchday engine has slowly become a joke over the years, tolerable but still worsening for the past 3 editions, this one being the worst. injuries are through the roof in this version (even after the hotfix tweaks) and its impossible to keep a players fitness up even with squad rotation. in addition to the injuries the goals are insane your team will score 100 goals a season with anichebe as your main attacking threat but youll also concede just as many with neuer as your keeper. tactics dont seem to matter all that much, after testing it seems the main factor is your familiarity with it. if its low youll drop easy wins without question as your defenders refuse to perform any type of tackle. in all i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone in its current state and i really hope si throw out some massive fixes/improvements and soon.",79.7
"pros: love the new layout and skin, communication with players is better than ever love the new options in transfer and contract negotiations cons: way too easy to sign top players, and the 48 month payment options are pretty broken. they should take more out of your budget for them since at the moment you can spend 100m on a 25m budget match engine is terrible. best way to win is by playing like big sam, hoof it up to the wingers and have a big man in the middle. keepers are also terrible, constantly fumbling into the path of oncoming strikers, getting caught in posession and passing to the opponent. defenders cant mark in the box and miss free headers constantly. i would say 3/4 of all goals come from a cross or a keeper / defender doing something shambolic. overall: great new features, coming at the expense of all the simple things. if they fix the match engine then this could be a very good installment. currently: 4/10 if patched: 9/10",1218.2
"apparently someone who makes the match engine died because the whole ing thing is a disaster. the most realistic football simulation game offers realistic scorelines such as 7-3, 6-2, and ive even seen an 8-8 draw. defending is non existent. goalkeepers take about 10 minuites to get up after they make a save and the whole thing is just broken. i lost 5-0 when my team had 15 shots 6 on target and they had around 5 shots 3 on target. 2 of them were own goals and the rest were rebounds from the keeper. if you call that realistic i have no idea what league you are looking at. i hate when people say its your tactics; ive tried every tactic possible just to get some results and nothing works. i started about 3 saves now. i like the new layout and the game mechanics. but the match engine is godawful and unfinished to the point where i question if its a football game. why the  is the match engine so bad when it was amazing on fm14? go back to 14 everybody where you can get realistic scorelines. tl;dr , nobody can score, nobody can defend, goalkeepers are apparently disabled. dont buy it until a patch comes out.",386.4
"won the league with liverpool. most unrealistic version yet. 1/10",236.2
"its another year and another football manager game. i will play it for countless hours again because i am addicted to this sort of game and i play fm because frankly, there is no alternative. does this mean i will either recommend it or give it a good review? once again, not this year. the lack of ability in si to actually listen to the reviews of its customers is just awful. this is a company that has been excellent in the past at implementing user ideas. in the past few season such bugs as far too many injuries (they argue there are fewer than real life, blah, blah) and goal keepers who just let the ball in after catching it have been glaring issues, just to name two examples but i could go on like this for hours with things they just choose to ignore or tell us are not issues at all. the new user interface is just trash, especially the tactics screen and this does not seem to be getting addressed despite cries from the user base, once again. i dont really need to write a long list of things wrong with this game, just quickly browsing the review section here will show you what is sorely missing and what is over looked. i want to love fm again, but it looks like they are just making too much money and only listening the fan boys on their main forums to care about the user base anymore.",526.4
"ridiculous match engine which sees many matches end 4-4, 6-4, 5-5 etc. you will go 3-0 up and use containing tactics to protect your lead, only to conceed 5 second half goals and lose 3-5. ive already had 3 goals scored from attacking teams own half i.e 60/70 yard strikes. most goals come from rebounds from the keeper or the woodwork. its all just a bit broken. i have been playing football manager since its amiga championship manager days and this has to be the worst effort yet. i usually wait for these titles to go on sale but bought this one at full price, eager to get hold of my teams (watford) potential promotion winning squad. never again will i pay full price for a football manager game. very disappointed. i am sure future patches will address some of these issues but they never should have released an unfinished, unbalanced game",153.1
"until we get a fix for injuries, this game is unplayable. no matter what i do, all the players get injured for many months, it is impossible to play. the devs say it is low compared to real life, but its a lie, in real life we dont see so much injuries lasting for so many months so often, this is bull****. btw, ive prepared my players with a lot of conditioning training in pre-season and everything, but it doesnt matter, they still get injured almost every game and in between one another.",143.2
"not saying this is a bad game not at all. i have played football manager since 2012 and know the game in and out. now this is the most fun football manager. but is the most fake as in a season only having one 0-0 game where i play defence with counter attack still does make for an interesting season. having 127 goals and 58 conceded is interesting to watch as well do not get me wrong. but this is the most unrealistic football manager they have put out. its a joke how many goals go in and how much is just plain unrealistic. example first game in the prem just got middlesbrough promoted playing against liverpool games ends 8-6 .... 8-6 !!! how does that happen? if you want an unreal intense football manager where it is all goals goals goals then this is for you if you want a football manager go and play the last year and just download a mod that updates teams for you because this is not a football manager. pros  - a lot of goals - never a dull game - more in-depth communication with player and staff - in match team talks - better transfer and overall balancing - always fun most game end with a min of 3 goals - more goals goals !!! goals for every one - being able to speak to a player who does not want to come instead of being blocked by agent gives more scope to get players out of your range cons  - very unrealistic - random injurie spells (not always but can end up having 9 players out for 3 weeks after 2 games and two weeks of training) so always save and quit when this starts as when it does the injuries will not stop until you cannot field a team - no matter strategy you will score a lot and concede a lot - could still have more depth, i still think it has got too streamlined from 2012 - players seems to get very unhappy fast and all seem to being a stubborn as a mule unless you use the talk ( x player is having good form) no matter the form they seem to agree with you - having a one 0-0 in a hole season and 3 strikers with more than 20 goals and top 6 goals scores in the league all having more the 30 goals kind of makes it seem very unrealistic - german league rights have gone and still no badges for most top flights teams ( mods do fix both mind) overall for people wanting fun 7/10 people wanting a football manager 3/10",76.4
"well this is it, the last fm game ill ever buy for full price. its not a bad game on its own, but charging aaa price for this yearly database update, and on top of that shamelessly charging 4.5 euros for the ingame editor is the last straw for me. at least give the pre-order buyers a ~40% discount and a free ingame editor, because your yearly rehash is highly overpriced right now, si/sega. honestly i dont know what i was expecting out of this years game, it has been exactly the same for what, 5-6 years now? and thats only if you count the annoying interviews and the 3d engine, take those away, and its the same exact game i played 12 years ago. that would not necessarily be a bad thing if they didnt ask for so much money. the things the game gets wrong, as si would put it, include (but are not limited to): the economy is screwed up still. the poor, low reputation clubs still ask that you pay more than the players market value, yet they set your club with their real world budget and debts! they really dont give a damn, its all about rich clubs and england as usual (because the premier league is the only important one. out of 100+ leagues, 100% of people play in the premier league, right?). the 3d match engine still looks and acts janky as all hell, defenders will just stand next to the loose ball while the opposition striker is charging in at full speed. the amount of goals scored is currently too high to be remotely realistic. i never had a game without scoring, only 3 without conceding, i beat one team 10-3, played 15 competitive matches, scored 51, and conceded 24 goals, so 75 goals in 15 matches, if i count the 4 friendlies it gets even more ridiculous. the game still has the cheating match engine, you lose to a weaker team, you know it was set up, so you reload the game to test it, you lose again, maybe 10 reloads later you get a draw, but you wont win until you give up the 3d engine and switch to text mode, or til you... thats right folks, until you buy the ingame editor and fix the game. :) - call me a noob and ill just delete your comment (and assassinate you when you arent looking), ive been playing the game for 12 years, and i know my tactics and training setups. wouldnt be fair if i didnt say anything positive about this years changes, would it now? - i like the new interface. as for the recommendation, if you own the last years game, or 2013, 2012... 2004 dont buy this game, the semi updated 3d engine has nothing good to offer, and the rest of the game is totally the same, the database update is not worth the money until the game goes 75% off. if you dont own any fm games, but would like to buy one, get it at 50% off. if youre like me and pre-ordered it, go to the steam store and look at games you could have bought instead, and cry. or keep playing this, theyre bound to patch the stupid out of it at some point, right... right? finally, here are my scores for the game: full price score - 5/10 - absolutely not worth 50 of any world famous currency (except rubles maybe). 50% off - 7/10 - if youre shaking and fifa 15 doesnt help, you might want to give fm 15 a shot. 75% off - 8/10 - get it and enjoy it. by the time it goes down to 75% off, the patches should soften the rough edges, youll be getting the best version of this years game at a reasonable price.",37.8
"i love the football manager series ,this game has potential but it has some serious teething issues and needs updated. the high score lines and players getting injured every game is very unrealistic and not up to usual standard. ive been playing fm since the start and was put off by the mix reviews on here but decided to try it for myself . i dont understand how people can honestly enjoy or reccommend this game in its current state? pros- looks good and performance is fast. new interface is good and easy to use once you get used to it. scouting has been improved. cons- far too many injuries ,at least one per game leading to a selection crisis. no matter what team or league i pick. far too many high score lines, 4-4, 6-4, 7-5 , 4-3 , even against lower league teams. goal keepers are slow to get up after a save. defending is poor/non existent no matter what team or tactics you deploy , i have yet to keep a clean sheet. far too many goals from long range against you. far too many goals conceded from crosses. one game with everton vs new england revelation i had 30 shots on target and scored 2 goals. they had 6 and they beat me 6-2! its not very realistic and what i expect from a football manager game . i can put up with the high scorelines, but the constant injuries is infuriating. no matter what team or league or the set up in training etc , even the reserves seem to pick up injuries . you shouldnt have a selection headache due to injury a few games into the season. it has potential but im only a few hours in and these issues have put me off. i expected to be lost in the game and have 20 plus hours gameplay by now! i simply cannot reccomend this until they address the issues.",38.8
"magically manifest yourself as a footballing god then slam yourself into an unsuspecting team as their ruler and master. force players to bend to your whim as you capture, train and then send them into battle against other teams. spend many seasons working through the football ladder, competing for trophies and the souls of your fallen enemies, all the while waiting for a chance to stab your greedy, greedy board in the back and leap lovingly into the arms of a mexican sugar daddy; his promises of blood money enough to sway your morals. who needs them when you can buy messi and ronaldo for shrewsbury town? muchas gracias amigo!",378.1
"an important public service announcement: do not, i repeat do not, buy this ing piece of utter horse , under any, i repeat any, circumstances. the match engine is ed beyond all recognition. it will drive you insane thinking that the game is scripted, but it honestly is not. it is just so ineptly designed that even now, after years of releasing these games, defenders will still trap the ball, then run away from it, allowing the opposition free goals. why is this happening? laziness and complacency on the part of the developers. do not spend your money on this ing shithouse unless you feel justified in feeding their evil empire. i found out the hard way. you have been warned.",37.4
"time for yet another fm, and instead of the usual praise to the sky; i find myself struggling for words. i played as fc copenhagen, within a month i had 8(!) first/key team members out with injuries - and not just the common cold, mind you - no, oh no. one with a broken ankel, two with damaged tendrons, a broken foot etc. the shortest injury was 3(!!!!) months - i feel like im running a community hospital rather than a football club. anyways, we recover and start winning some matches - except... we dont. for some odd reason it seems like you can dominate a match, to the point where even the opponents fans are rooting for you, and yet they still pull a comeback at the end. draws galore. 1 shot, 1 kill, so to speak. but heck, lets review some of the positives as well... great, realistic scouting system. good layout. aaaaand. yup. id recommend you wait purchasing this game until another update has come out. do it for you own sake, and for ours - the unfortunate souls that purchased this game in good faith that it would be the high standard the game usually is. let them feel the heat, so they can fix this asap.",513.0
"please release a game that works; you spend each year just updating - then charge us for it; stop taking our money for v. minor changes! other games would be laughed at. a few shocking points. - gks fly like reflexes? its insane! - no ones ever fit? - goal shy stirkers? - refs that never give fouls, ever! one of my players was hacked 4 times in the box in the same move. even the most free willing ref would crumble to that! not that we can see anyway because the graphic are so rubbish! - man utd never lose? - players just standing there with the ball turning in the spot? a year and you give us this, wow?? - wing backs that run past someone (overlap) then slow down to be overtaken again by defenders!? - the whole game runs v.slow. general animation is wack for the where were at in the world. - one (more) year and you offer us graphics and animation this bad? there not even an animation for shielding the ball! build a game on tactics, not buying a bunch of star players. and after all these years youve still not sorted training out lol, this is where teams build there style of play!! wow its good game but it very bad too!",287.2
"as much as i love the franchise and the previous releases, this one just doesnt do it for me. its a horrible game atm.. realism; non existing. its basically fm14 with a sidebar, more time wasted on annoying interviews and an, if you can belive it, even worse match engine (the worst one so far in any fm game imo). it has the potential to become a great game, but it needs so, so, so much work that i dont think si will be able to pull it off before the release of fm16. im not going to recommend this game right now, but if there is a god then it might be worth it to check back in 2 or 3 months to see if anything has improved. cheers..",141.2
"playing fm since 2000/2001. the series is my favourite of all time across all genres. the last 3 years however the game has been getting gradually more of an exercise in ambigious tedium than the magical gaming experience it used to be. i appreciate the people at si need to change the game to justify the price tag, i just dont know why they insist on breaking the game to do so. i can only hope the truly awful new features (im looking at you tactics screen) will be patched. they wont though, way too much pride. god what ive give for the return of slide bars. id also love some explanation, no matter how vague, for how the 10 million different variables that can affect the outcome of a match actually work. im certain si changed the way things like tempo work in game for different tactics without mentioning it or eve updating the tips bar. poor form. moreover, having touchline shouts, pressers, player interaction, 3 teamtalks its too much, and its for the most part very very boring. as for the me just like with fm14 and 13 at release, its broken. you would think after 2 poor mes at release si would have the integrity and self respect to deliver this year... i remember when si used to release games that didnt need a single patch. i think the monopoly si have over the genre has made them complacent, its only natural i suppose. do not purchase until they have fixed the game. maybe in mid march 2 months before the season ends :d",299.5
"i love football manager, but they really messed up with this version. the transfer screen is a mess and it is hard to find new players. everything has been hiden in strange menues and wen you finally find the thing you want to do, you cant remember where you found it. the live game is like watching a game with kids! it is not uncommen to see 8-9 players in a small area and noone can hit the ball. the keeper has two settings: catch every ball or drop everything. it is not uncommen to see your keeper jumping high and it takes forever to hit the ground again. that makes it so easy for the attackers to score. (it is not a bug its a feature)..... dont get me started with the freekicks! if your player has a higher rating then 1 i freeking you will score if it is nearer then 90 meters from the goal! oh i forgot about the demands from the players. i played my first season as brndby and 8... eight ing players demanden to be sold. that was devestating for the morale of the team, but come on! i cannot sell 8 players in one transfer period! at the end of every season do some different players demand to get sold, and they get angry, and so do the rest of the guys, if you do not let them accept an offer. not just any offer ooooh no, but a offer from the last transfer period. that is just plain stupid. you cannot sell a player in a closed marked! the game sucks bigtime. it is harder then ever, so even if you plays manchester united against bradford, you still are up for a huge chalenge! dont buy this game! its a mess and not worth the money! stay with fm14 i know i will undtil most of the bugs are fixed!",401.8
"i have played every version of this game since it came out. like any crack addict, i was compelled to buy knowing the risks. hell, i even upgraded my pc just so i could play the game properly because the last two incarnations just wouldnt work on my battered old machine. there are always problems when it first comes out. ive found that the problems persist until a patch comes out in december/january. now for the breakdown: good - the user interface is so much better; there is more interaction with players; you can force moves out with a gentle discussion - a great innovation. bad - whats going on with the tactics? i was scoring plenty of goals, but i noticed that i was conceding far too many. maybe it was my tactical setup? so, when i went into a 3-0 lead, i decided to shore up my defence. i dropped my defenders back and even my wingers. yet, once again, i was conceding the same sort of goals - a cross into the box and finished because my full back was somewhere else or (more usually), the goalie making a save and the rebound always falling to their striker. the end result was 4-3. my stats showed i had the tallest team in the league and thus scored most from corners. however, i also conceded the most from corners. wtf?! i developed one tactic where i gave up trying to win away and just park a bus. still a 5-2 thrashing. i won the league scoring over 100 goals. i conceded more than the relegated teams (70). despite brilliant fitness coaches, i was losing to loads of last minute goals. why, god, why?! i love this game and always will, but to get most enjoyment, ill wait until the patch.",317.2
"just up-graded from 2013 (i only do it every 2 years to avoid disapointment lol) and this is the buggiest version to date graphics glitches left, right and centre and very few new exiting features, plust the engine needs sorting out its even worse than the original unpatched version of 2013 and that was poor enough with at least 1 owngoal a match. as it stands with out some heavy patching from si this game is almost unplayable! as for a recommendation all i have to say is dont buy this game yet, wait for some updates to be released.",131.6
"such a disappointment. a step back, poor game engine, stupid scorelines, too many injuries, beta same as the main game? needs a major patch, all getting worse since fm2012. they need to get back to basics!",274.8
"played football manager since its inception in 84 on the zx spectrum, this is one of the worst in the series for multiple reasons. the devs seem to have the notion of more is constantly better whilst getting the fundamentals of the game which always stood it above the rest completely wrong. i have thousands of hours in football manager games and never been compelled to write a negative review. although playable is not great, the series has gone downhill the last few years in my opinion.",117.7

"tl;dr - worst game in the series, bar none. what an fing disgrace. actual review - many game companies fall into the habit of getting caught up in the new features each iteration of their game come out with, while neglecting the problems inherent in the core game itself. we get it, its hard to sell a game to new customers if the biggest thing you can advertise is we toyed with the balancing all year! or we sorted out all the issues with the code!. fm unfortunatly has fallen into just that trap. anyone who has played the past several years of fm can tell you that while many new features have been added, they have by and large slapped onto a  foundation of code that struggled under the weight of a match engine it could not adequately support. watching your 30 million pound striker send a suicide mans backpass to the keeper from an attacking postion, wingers shooting at impossible angles on goals, keepers booting the ball off their own players and into the goal... and so on. any person with a shred of computer programming literacy could tell you that what si needed to do was go back to square one. instead, si made the mind numbingly awful decission to slap a brand new, considerably more complicated match engine, on top of their  code, and had the gall to advertise it as a completely new product. low and behold, you have one of the worst footy simulators to have graced this earth. it colapses under it own weight with comical regularity (just watch your players freeze on the pitch for no reason, like someone turned the power off.). no patch is gonna be able to polish this turd. id suggest buying an older, more stable version if you have to have your fix, but then youd be supporting these crooks.",486.7
"update: 3-18-2015 logged in to try the update for a while and had this experience: spent hours refining tactics in preseason games, getting everything just right. spent a lot of time working on training regimens to make sure the historically injury prone have slightly less intense work outs. spent hours working my scouts to death... got near the start of the season and had some great transfers lined up to come in. wanyama, tielemans, depay, and a few other youngins. a net spend sure but after negotiating hard deals for kaboul, capoue, and adebayor i was well within the transfer budget. we are go for launch! a few days after the deals were agreed but before the players came to terms, what happens? kaboul our 4 weeks. capoue broken for 3 months. in training. the deals are off and i have not saved for hours. i swear to god, they made injuries a problem so you have to buy the editor. ill need to see stellar reviews for any future version before i pay again. what an absolute heartbreaking shame. there used to be a game here. update: 1-24-2015 i still dont recommend this game. i do recommend this series. nothing else compares to fm. there isnt a single sports management simulation in all of video games that comes close to how well fm does what it idoes. if you are a new player, get fm14. itll be cheaper, and you dont have to pay full price for fm15 to get up to date rosters. search the community hub and google for player and team updates and how to install them. again, if you are on the fence, get fm14. its super good. original review: ive averaged about 650-700 hours in each years fm, dating back to 2011. ill keep this short. there are great improvements to this game, i just wish i could get to them. every game i start, no matter the team, no matter the training, no matter the facilities, within 2 months of day one half of my first team is injured. this game is seriously broken right now. if there are not major fixes, i can consider my fm addiction cured.",91.5
"ive been playing football manager since 2005. this is without a doubt the most frustrating and unrealistic installment purely because of a buggy game simulation. sit and watch the 3d matches being played and youll be impressed at some nice new animations, but the game being played infront of you will make you want to put your fist through your monitor... - strikers miss 90% of 1 on 1 chances. - chances that should result in a goal often dont and come around far too often than in real life. - defenders that wander all over the place and dont tackle. - wingers that seem content to run into defenders rather than cross/pass the ball even if a teammate is in tons of space. that just names a few. needs a patch. a big one.",118.3
"do not buy this game!! check my games list, you will see that i once loved fm games, not anymore and never again will i buy one. this is the type of unfinished game that steam need to ban from being sold. certain key components dont even work at all, a small example is that there are no penalties from handballs right now. the game fails in every way it could, the me is a poor imitation of a crossing and set pieces simulator not a football simulator. it is worse than the last three years versions upon release and i can assure you that they all had bugs and issues, not this many or this bad. if you really need more just go to the forums and read, not many that will claim this game is anywhere near in a playable state, maybe in 7-8 months from the time i write this si will have released a patch that makes it something like a game. oh if that wasnt enough beware, si and sega are not co-operating and are in fact sending customers with issues back and forth between them. (not me, but check forum if you care) also be aware that si are deleting the vast majority of negative posts, claiming it will affect the way our customers play the game. which is of course true, they wouldnt play it because they would know whats wrong with it.",36.5
"agree with others here, very inbalanced, no matter what i do i leak in goals like my goal is ten time sbigger than the opponents, just no fun in this game at all, score lines are out of control, just horrid on so many levels, i really do hope they fix this quick, and yes you could have a player with a 18 pace and see someone with pace of 9 catch them with no effort at all.",721.3
"after 250 hours of game play, its time for a review of fm15. ive been playing these games for a long time (since cm96-97 since you asked), and honestly, i think this one is the best yet. there were some early problems with the match engine, and the inverted wing back role is still broken (he stays wide like a normal wing back), but the vast majority of the most glaring issues (high scoring games, regular goalkeeping errors, etc) have been fixed in sis patches and in good time as well. i thought the motion capture animations in the match engine would be a bit of a gimmick, but that has turned out to be a welcome addition to the game on an aesthetic level. its by no means hyper-realistic to the point where youd be unsure whether youre watching a match on tv or in fm, but its a big step up from the hand drawn players of fm14. the realism (or lack of) isnt a deal breaker for me, all i want to see is a realistic simulation of a football match and in fm15, thats what we have for the most part. if you watch the matches on comprehensive highlights or higher, then you can easily see your tactical decisions playing out in front of you as the game ebbs and flows, and for that, if nothing else, fm15 is the best edition of the football manager series so far. setting up a tactic is fairly simple, although not fool proof, but like any simulation, its easy to get in to, and difficult to master. one thing i have noticed though, having spent a lot of time talking to other players and reading some of the reviews here on steam, is that this is not a game for players who want to just pick a match day squad and have a hands-off approach to management. you will succeed at fm if you make sensible tactical choices, always be mindful of balance in your roles/duties and dont use the same approach for every match you play. every match will play out differently. the most common complaints ive seen from others are regarding injuries and dominating the game yet losing in the dying moments of the match. for injuries, i dont have these problems as i make sure my players are fully fit. use pre-season wisely, allow your players to ease into it after coming back from holiday, then train hard and play lots of friendlies. once the season begins, lower the intensity of training and give them all individual set ups. it takes a while, but if you do this, your players will be much less prone to injury and will develop faster as well. there will be injuries of course, but i dont have anywhere near the issues others are having, and most of my injury problems are in-game due to my aggressive high pressing style. on the domination side of things, i will say that more shots and possession does not mean dominance. choose your battles wisely. if youre the bigger team, you can expect your opponent to sit back and hit you on the counter. counter this yourself by playing patiently and forcing mistakes, your creative players will take care of the rest. im not an fm expert, but if you take these simple words of advice, then you will see for yourself how quickly things will turn around for your team. the only thing i cant comment on yet is the ais squad development in the long term as i havent gone far enough into the game yet. in past fms, this has been a problem, but i can already see less instances of the ai spending millions on a player only to let him rot in their reserve team. as si say themselves, itll never be perfect, itll never be finished, so as long as you go into the game with that mindset, youll get the most out of it. i highly rcommend this game for anyone who watches football analytically or who thinks they could do a better job than their favourite teams manager.",1155.9
"waste of money, full of bugs and unchanged from previous games!",488.3
"i wouldnt recommend buying this game until a few patches are released. the release version is full of bugs, especially the match engine, that makes it almost unplayable. i mean, sure, you can play it, but you just have to cringe at all the goals scored from obvious match engine bugs. at this point, 50% of goals are scored from crosses on the wing that your defenders just dont contest, 30% scored from set pieces, 10% scored on missplaced backpasses to the keeper and 10% for the rest. the defense and goalie are so terrible most matches end with 4+ goals scored. if you want to win, just make sure you have wingers who like to hug the touchline and cross the ball instead of cutting inside should have expected it really, it is the first time i buy fm right on the release date.",251.6
"well well, where do i start.. upon reading reviews of this game (largely negative) i was very cautious on purchasing this, but i still did as i love fm. ill start with the positives, i like the new interface, it makes it much easier as everything is in front of you in one screen rather that lots of drop-down menus having to be opened. it also looks alot smoother and i like having world news opened up in a tab after skipping a day which means i wouldnt have to subscribe to other teams and leagues or some players. negatives? hold your breath because this could be a long one depending on how much i want to type. i have played three competitive matches with my team oxford united and here are the scorlines: 4-2 burton (w), 1-5 wolves (l), 6-3 mansfield (l), thats 8 goals scored and 13 goals conceded in three games. outraged enough as it is. i saw lots of people reporting situations like a large amount of injuries, the high-scoring games, players with apparent mental and physical disabilities, too many own goals.. well, in those 3 games i had expereinced all of these things. during the match against mansfield alone i had an injury (my 6th in total including the 2 i started with), my right back halting mid-run unchallenged then leaving an opposition player to score 1 on 1, and then two own goals just to add to my misery. who knows i may just be getting all the rubbish out of the way early and the remainder of my entire fm15 career with be rage free (yeah sure, good luck with that son), but in my honest opinion do not buy this game if you are capable to rage and wait until it is cheaper/there has been a patch which sorts this out. come on guys, wake up. this is poor. if the in-match experience is improved then this would be a good game and i will go back to my usual fm addictive binge playing until the early hours of the morning, but i will not be playing until there is this patch, whenever that is..",203.2
"its decent installment again but nothing much is new. i paid 35 bucks for this and just upgraded from the beta to the full game and i dont notice a single difference... everything still is as shady as in the beta :( this just wont stand... it means theyve probably had this game ready for ages since the changes are just graphical mostly and want to hussle us as much as they can. of course the engine / card / injury system is messed up on launch as usual too ffs why do i keep falling for their scummy tricks... i cant recommend anyone buying this now, get it for 15-20 bucks and after a few patches and maybe then its a decent update. (had to choose thumbsdown until the state of the game changes, then my review might change too) edit: just got a crash dump error for the second time as well, im done with this till they patch it, back to fm14 it is sigh :( edit #2: the only thing fixed are the crash dumps, i no longer get crashes but the match engine is still so random and terrible that i dont even want to play no more. edit 3: 20/12/2014: almost winter and this game is still a mess, you can lose to the number 18 of the league with your best eleven and then 3 days later win against a stronger opponent with your b-squad for no reason at all. si should be ashamed of themselves.",443.5

"oh boy... where to start? the pros? the game is so in-depth, detailed and looks great that at first glance you feel like you are in heaven. unfortunately, the absolutely ridiculous ai and randomness of the game ruins it for brand new players and seasoned veterans alike very quickly. i have played football manager games since the 1990s. i have bought every game in this football manager series. i have probably tens of thousands of hours of experience playing these, and have thoroughly enjoyed every fm yet. until this fiasco. i have only played this one with two teams, man united and sheffield united, but the experience has been identical. the game is so damn unrealistic, that it will suck the life out of you. these are actual situations that happened in my season with man united. a month into the season, i have lost nearly third of my team to long injuries. some players cannot put together two games in a row before returning to the injury list. not totally out of the question, but highly unlikely. queens park rangers finished 2nd in the epl in my first season, while tottenham and liverpool barely missed relegation. i finished 9th, and got fired. i kept beating the top teams repeatedly, while collapsing at home 0-5 to teams like qpr and swansea. i lost 5-0 to a 9-man manchester city, after winning the shots 14-5 and hitting the post/crossbar five times. frustrating, but not impossible. but scenarios like this unfold throughout the season; the likes of rooney and mata cannot score regardless of opposition or their position on the field while james wilson bangs out a 30-goal campaign, you can literally have a guy of van persies stature standing on the 6-yd line with an empty net and hit the post over and over again, and dont even get me started on these phantom goalies... you can be playing against a backup to the backup goalie 2 divisions below yours, and fail to score, while the opposition sinks 3 behind de gea on three shots. i scored 2 or 3 goals from direct free kicks all season, and maybe twice from a corner. my opponents? you got it, somewhere around dozens. now, it might sound like im making excuses and dont know how to manage. but as i said, i have enjoyed these types of games some 20 years, whether i win or lose. why? because the games have been as fair and realistic as a simulations sports game can be. sure, there will always be that crazy 7-5 home win against some world class team, but when it happens once every 150 games or so, thats pretty okay... there will always be that game where an underdog takes you down and leaves you extremely frustrated. but guess what, it actually happens... what doesnt happen are the scenarios i discussed above, and after some 150 hours into fm 2015, i feel like i have enough personal experience to call this game total garbage. fortunately, fm 2013 and fm 2014 are still installed on my computer, and still offer limitless hours of fun and entertainment. do not waste your money on this game, play the older installations and wait until sports interactive gets their crap straight. a major major disappointment.",148.7

"im a fifa manager guy. however, as it has been discontinued, i had to move to football manager. a friend taught me the ropes, and ive been playing for a while. i played with liverpool, ac milan, bayer leverkusen and atltico madrid. no game has gone to mid-season. i studied, researched and spent a lot of time talking with friends about this game. i wish i hadnt. this is just the worst manager game ive ever played for a simple reason: nothing you do matters. i bought marco reus and alex oxdale-chamberlain to play on the wings. might as well have kept the money for myself and used emile heskey and djimi traor there. the most skilled player cannot dribble past the worst defender. the best crosser of the ball cannot beat the first man. the tallest and best header cannot score 3 goals a season from crosses. every team play the exact same way, and most goals come from the same three things: shots from outside the box, defensive mistakes and free-kicks. in upwards of 300 hours spent in the game, i dont think i saw a single goal from a corner. however, three times i saw a goalkeeper handle the ball outside the box and get booked, and two of those free-kicks resulted in goals. players are so unbelievably stupid that its annoying. steven gerrard to take a free kick on the edge of the box. you think hes going for goal. no. hes going to pass it back to the left back, who will then try to dribble and lose it. you think asmir begovic is a good goalkeeper? well, hes not above handling the ball outside of the box when trying to boot it upfield. id always been told that football manager was all about the tactics, and that it is the hardest thing to manage. well, it is hard. specially because no matter how you set your team up to play, they will always play the same way. you can try to get the best passers of the game, but they will misplace at least 30% of their 6 yard passes. this is so frustrating im at a loss for words. injuries? well, hows this for a list. before the third match of the season, i had the following players injured: steven gerrard, jordan henderson, alex oxdale-chamberlain, alberto moreno, john flanagan, marco reus, adam lallana, daniel sturridge, asmir begovic and mario balotelli. thats before the third match! all of those players (bar lallana and reus, who are injured at the start of the season) got injured during pre season! seriously? unless this game is heavily patched to fix everything thats not just wrong, but plain dumb, ill be forced to stop playing a genre i really enjoy because ea were not competent enough to keep fifa manager going, and because sega apparently have no clue what a football match looks like. ill wait and see. but i will not hope for much.",641.2

"after reading quite a few very negative reviews, and some positive reviews, i decided to stay dedicated to the football manager series and buy this next installment (after having played 09, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14). i was not disappointed. fm15 offers quite a bit of changes; everything from the 3d matches to the interface, gameplay and responsiveness. first off, the responsiveness of the game has greatly increased and improved. the game is far more responsive than earlier versions, and seems to go easier on the processor. second, interface. the interface has been changed drastically. anyone who has played the previous fm installments will have a hard time at first with getting to grips with this new interface, but the change is definitely for the better. it is far more intuitive and works far better for newer players - and it might take a while to get accustomed to it but once you do, you realize exactly how much of a fabulous and welcome change it is. it makes the game navigation far easier, smoother and smarter - which, in addition to the games responsiveness, makes for a very fluid gaming experience. the 3d matches however, are not to my liking. the cartoonish graphics and unrealistic movement of the players reminds me more of fifa 95 than a modern game. in my eyes, this is a step back from fm14 in fact, and hinders the game somewhat as the players score unlikely and unrealistic goals sometimes, or commit some extremely unrealistic movement and the entire feel of it is just awkward. but, now, my last and most important point: gameplay. my god has this changed. the whole game feels incredibly new, the tactics screen is much easier to navigate through, the inbox makes your life incredibly easy (with interactions with players/transfers/almost anything can be done directly from the inbox when prompted with a message about it), transfers are *far* more realistic, negotiations about contracts too, player interactions have seen a major improvement, as have interviews with the press and team talks. heck, even the backroom advice is better! the entire interaction/conversation section is much easier to navigate through, works far better and more fluildy and seems to have a much greater impact on the game. players seem to interact better and more often, and their interactions have real positive or negative effects on your team and the game and thats absolutely fantastic. its one of the major things that has been missing, proper interactions. many people have stated that the game is unrealistic, that they lose all the time or get injured all the time - and i have one thing to say: review your tactics. the game is *not* broken. ive been playing for a while now with arsenal (the most injury stricken team ever) and ive only had two injuries so far, both of them under three weeks out for the players - and the players are extremely susceptible to injuries (jack wilshere and gibbs), so its understandable. the scores have been realistic so far as far as im concerned, and from what i can tell, the problems people have been having directly link to their inability to adapt to the new game interface and inability to create proper tactics. the only real thing that bothers me about this game however, is the fact that the current ability and potential ability ratings for players seems to have decreased extremely from fm14 for some odd reason, and in some places its truly uncalled for. i mean, for example, how can it be that alexis sanchezs current ability is only 165, when hes clearly having a *much* better season than, for example, sergio aguero whose current ability is around 180? thats just ludicrous. but lets be real, im happy that this is the only bad thing i can say about this game (and the 3d part), i mean, thats the least of our worries. eventually, the football manager series heavily relies on tactics, not on individuals, and thats what makes it great and thats also what makes this flaw really minor. i highly recommend this game and see it as a step in the right direction for si.",102.4

"thank god i only paid 5 for this, prasie the lord for gifts cards!! when playing fm13, i thought that these games were head and shoulders above any other football game in terms of the imersiveness and the elevel of realism. but the last two games since then have been truly discusting. i dont care about the graphics, thats not what the game is about, but the actual realism of the match engine is poor. what is going on with the goalkeepers this year?? about 10-15 of my conceded goals have come directly from rebounds from frankly rediculous saves from the keep, he will just parry the ball away from the most tame shot imaginable and stand there for about a year until the follow up from the opposition striker rolls it in. then he dives. injuries are something which many people are complaining about. i dont feel like my tactical changes have any efect on the game. match stats mean nothing. this is a real shame because i have a lot of time for si but im losing faith by the day. i feel like some things happen on the game just to make you more addicted, becasue lets be honest, its more addictive when your not winnimg, because you cant put the game down until you have sorted it. and why do you have a sudden drop in form ever jan or feb. every team has a bad patch, but i, aloong with many other players have unexplained drops in form where nothing you do can halt the slide. i could go on for hours but i cant be bothered to give anymore feed back because i dont think it makes any differenc so if this review does nothing more than let me take my anger out on it, then so be it",79.0
"like every previous football manager games, i preordered fm15 just to play beta. i have to say this year, there are way more bugs then every other years. i played 50 hours in the first 3 days of the release of the beta version and i spotted about 10 problems. because this is my favourite game i just keep playing and identify bugs in the bugs forum so my favourite game can be fixed. yet, i waited after two updates, the game is still not fixed. bugs that are still not fixed: - after stadium expansion plan got cancelled, the finishing date still highlight on the calendar. - rooney get unhappy because pre season training start too early even though it is nearly december. - defenders with at least 15 pace and 15 acceleration chase down the ball that has passed the defenders line ridiculously slow. this is the most frustrating bug. how can phil jones or jonny evans or rafael chase down a ball so so so slow, it is pretty much slower than others walking. the opponent end up getting ball easily since the defenders cant even get the ball with 50 metres head start. throughout the 3 seasons, ive seen this occurred 20 times, so im quitting until it is fixed. - set-piece marking is completely broken, i set pretty much all my players to defend, 3 form wall and 7 markers against 5 opponent. yet 3 out of 5 opponents are completely unmarked and freely roaming around on the side of my wall. - team selection layout maybe a minor issue, but it can be annoying if you have a big squad or you want to pick someone in the youth team. there used to be a sub slots column next to starting formation/line up, now it it gone. you now have to drag a player from the players list to the substitute slots on the same list. picking substitute has never been harder in my life. - budget adjustment in my first season at manutd, i can adjust the transfer budget to zero so i can have 3.6 mil per week for wage budget. the second season, i adjust it all the way to wage budget, but i can only get 3 mil per week wage budget. so that means my minimum transfer budget is 60 mil. im paying players 3 mil wage per week so whats the point of having maximum 3 mil for wage budget and 60 mil for transfer budget? why cant i have all my transfer budget all my wage budget? - there are many more... i have posted all the bugs ive spotted on the bugs forum but all i get is pissy tone replies or thread closed for lacking evidence. they expect me to download this thing so i can post the game file on the server for them, and ive try installing it on my mac countless of time, it failed to install. not to mention it is sponsored by mackeeper, a freaking mac virus. i tried to posted screenshot on the forum, it never works. they recommended this other software which has 2 weeks trial for free, do i have to pay to help them identify the bugs? i tried upload so videos of the bugs so my thread doesnt get close down, and i get all these pissy replies. since there server doesnt work, i upload the game file on a file hosting website, they still expect me to upload it on a server that never works on my mac. mostly unappreciated replies when im trying to help them, occasionally i get a nice reply but i am very unhappy with the game. i save up my pocket money to preorder it, paypal converted the money to profit them, i got charged by banks with overdrawn fee and i get a game full of rubbish.",137.2

"at first i thought this game was a massive step up on fm 14 but after playing for only a few hours i have realised what a massive dissapointment this game really is, i knoiw itss only beta but so many things need changing that i cant see the end products as being that good. first of all injuries are outragious, you are guaranteed to get an injury a game and can find yourself without you key players only 4 games in to the season. second problem is the new match engine the amount of times my players have just stood there and watched charlie adams ping a 50 yard screamer in whilst my keeper does nothing is ridiculos, seriously though the ai rarely do anyting. the transfers are so unrealistic, the value of a player might be 10 million but you will end up having to pay 40 million for a decent player. finally the worst part is the inconsistency of the matches, you can go and play manchester city away and thrash the 6-0 and then lose at home to west brom 4-0 this was a problem in early fm 14 and that got soon fixed, im not saying you should win every game but the game feels too inconsistant, there isnt enough realism in matches. i have been looking forward to fm 15 for a while now and am quite dissapointed so far:( at this stage tbh i wouldt recommend fm 15 untill things have been changed, people are rating this game because i told my player i was gonnna sell him and he got upset that has been in fm for an age and isnt a real addition, there are positives of this game but not enough.",169.5

"i want to play this game. i like fantasy games. but everytime i start it up, i remember that half my team will be injured within the first 3 months. that no matter what i do consistency is not possible and my team will fail to perform and i will fail to have any real impact on that despite the rediculas sometimes over lapping micro-managing aspects that are both too specific and too general. example... exploit the flanks doesnt mean exploit the flanks more, it means only exploit the flanks unless you select other options. in which that ratio cant be controlled. example... you can have multiple coaches for multiple traits and skills but can only have one practice type per day. you can try to teach a player a new move or position; and its up to the player if hes compatable let alone compitent. you will train and trade and chances are players wont want to come to your club in which case the conversational options are minimal repetative and non-impactful. oh and did i mention that some of the user interface is completely bugged? and i mean completely! try organizing your custom view and watch as some of your options *do not appear*. you want to sort by position; sure, wait then why does it sort by ability when i click position? to suggest this game would be to encourage this type of lack luster game developing that is become the norm. im not saying you cant make money, but just publish a game every other year and charge us 100$ for something you can be proud of. instead of dusting off and polishing the same game with improved data.",135.3
"i love the game very much however there are always some concerns. these are all game play issues: 1) a few players ratings. messi is 20 everything as usual but he didnt have a great last season like he usualy does. some players are quite underrated such as di maria and a few atletico madrid players. ronaldo has 15 acceleration.... (not sure how that works.) 2) some errors made by defenders and keepers are simply unexplainable.(not sure if its a bug or not). sometimes the defenders just heads/pass the ball back towards the keeper and then the keeper just stands there making no attempt of clearing it whilst an opposition is running towards it. 3) when players dribble they run into teamates far too often. which is quite unrealistic as it hardly ever happens in real life. 4) this is a very irritating one. players misses 1v1s far too much, if they have 4-5 1v1 chances theyll manage to score one.... this is very unacceptable as in real life players in top leagues simply dont miss all those chances. you could say that they are having a bad game but its happening consistantly throughout the season. also the opposition always manage to score them when they have the chance. but our players just blast it strait at their keepers. 5) final one so far... players some how manages to score some incredible long shots but they simply just blast it over the goal when they are at the 6 yard box which is again unexplainable (sometimes it is harder to miss then to just get it on target). so far i havnt seen a single finesse shot by my players and only 1 from the opposition. please could you fix these issues. i would be forever greatful.",203.2
"truly a horrible game to play. the game engine, match engine and what is referred to as the ai, actually just a randomisation engine based on mathematical equation, is defective. the players do not have any realistic actions or movements. the defensive simply does not work, especially crossballs which is impossible to defend against. your central defenders will try crossballs from deep regardsless of their shortt passing and less risky passing. your team will miss 4-5 clear cut chances every match, the opponent goalkeeper will always play high above level and your opponents players are always faster then yours. there has been so much focus on the administrative part of the game, that the actual playing a match part of the game has been overlooked. and as for the administrative part, it is boring and doll. constant and repeating media questions before and after every single match, makes one set of the assistant manager to handle it. individual traning for players is gone completely in order to facilitate new players, basically making the game easier to the point of being dumb. and this is in normal mode, they originally made the fm classic mode for that purpose. there are a few positives like the new scouting system and staff system, and the ui has been improved as well. but those things are easily forgotten in the face of the overwhelming onslaught of errors and lazy programming. all in all it is hard to see how this game got through testing... just kidding, sigames never test their games before release. and they do not care about correcting errors and flaws. most of what i have written was reported doing the beta fase of the game, but nothing was done about it. the beta was version 15.1 and the game is now on 15.1.3, so 3 versions later and nothing has changed. my advice, do not buy this game. it is defective and it is unlikely that it will ever be fixed. it reminds of fm2005 and fm2013. they were defective from the beginning and it was never fixed. ps. the metascore is faked. there are always equal number of positive reviews to the negative ones, and they always give equal opposite score.",771.9

"i was really looking forward to the latest edition of football manager. i have been buying them since 2007. this is easily the worst football manager for a long time. the match engine underpins this. there are a number of issues with it. the first is the goals per game. there have been numerous occasions where you will go into half time with a score at 3-3 or more. an example of this was when i was playing as newcastle and in a game against liverpool i was 4-2 up at half time only to eventually loose the game 8-5. this seems to happen all the time. the second is the goalkeepers. i have seen some absolutely blinding saves where a goalkeeper will jump from one end of the goal all the way to the other and still hold the ball. the next minute a shot from 30 yards will go right down his throat and he seems to jump out the way of it. the goal kicks are often very strange. i have often been in the situation where the keeper will simply pass it to the opposition striker who simply puts the ball in the net. extremely frustrating as you can imagine. in addition to this is if a goal keeper makes a save but doesnt hold onto the ball he seems to forget all about it. your defenders will also have no interest in it. the only person who is will be an opposition player who will run 45 yards for a simple tap in. but it only ever seems to be against you. it can be comical at times where the defenders are turning on the spot looking in all directions, the goalkeeper wandering around the six yard box and a striker skipping through and tapping it in. general mistakes with the engine involve every other position as well. if youre thinking of getting this game, dont! wait until they fix it or steer clear for good.",72.5

"it is a new game, with a new and very easy to use interface imo, together with the gameplay fm15 looks amazing on the outside. i know this is just a beta and i have only played a few hours on this game, i have encountered problems which i dont know whether i am terrible at managing arsenal or that the bugs are really messing me up. 1. lots and lots of own goals, it happened that calum chambers scored a hatrick of own goals against qpr which ultimately lost me the game. 2. injuries, injuries everywhere. at least all my players have been injured once since i have been in charge (4months) and it is getting ridiculous. debuchy was injured for 3 months then i played him once he got fit and got injured again for another 2. it is getting out of hand. 3. goalkeepers. where do i begin? goalkeepers do the craziest  in the entire world, sometimes it can be funny and other times its frustrating as fwuak. it is also not my own gk aswell when i check other games replay, the goalies can be proper (sorry). other than those issues this game has been great for me. i absolutely love the tactics menu, the new scouting system and more player interaction. even though this game does have its issues, it should not be discouraged to play it. i am sure these issues are being brought up by si and they are trying to fix it. personally even with its bugs, it is a better and more challenging game than fm14 7/10 peace <3 edit: si officialy released a patch fixing issues with the goalkeepers and the own goals <3 si",424.9
"im a big fan of fm games, been playing since 01/02 and have enjoyed many hundreds of hours of game time. ive been playing fm2015 since release, mostly offline (i have a lot more hours than probably shown and i have more than one account). this is the first time ive ever reviewed a game, im doing so because its just so broken i feel i have to. for every person saying the game is broken, theres another saying its because of bad tactics etc. well, for me its just a rage inducing festival of disappointment. yes theres going to be bugs, yes theres going to be the odd quirk, but when you reload a save and replay the same fixture a dozen times, using different squads and tactics and still concede an own goal in the 90th minute after conceding an 85th minute wonder strike, something is up. nothing i do seems to make a difference to the evidently pre-planned scoreline. you could edit in the best players in the world and theyd still lose 2-1 to sheffield flippin wednesday everytime on my save. i can live with the slightly mad bits of the game, players demanding to leave then moaning when theyre transfer listed or your only expensive purchase always getting a long term injury in first half of his second match for example, but when you get the impression that youre merely following a pre-ordained set of results, theres kind of no point. its a terrible shame and although i expect itll all be fixed eventually, its the one game i feel absolutely cheated by. 30 can get you a fair bit in the steam store, do think very carefully before spending it on a game that actually makes you (for the first time ever) angry at playing. if you find otherwise, if you find it to be brilliant, good on you. i know the developers are active in the forums, trying to sort stuff out which deserves some credit, but theyve got their work cut out. of that much i am certain.",14.8
"issue for me these days with fm is the staleness of the whole experience. there are things wrong with the match engine as others have pointed out, but the whole series has emphasised width over depth since it moved from being cm to fm - ive been playing since domark versions on the amiga. i remember when we only had text based commentary and the tension was incredible, there was the feeling of just being given enough information and let your imagination fill in the gaps. fm2015 in particular gives you so many features it can initially feel overwhelming, until that is, you realise it doesnt really matter. keep your players happy, make sure your tactics are reasonably sane, gradually improve your squad, and well thats it... obviously, you can complicate that as much as you like if thats what you want, but the whole game experience is totally flat now. every iteration just adds a couple more features that arent really fleshed out much on top of a bunch of features from previous iterations that havent been developed further once they have been introduced. all we seem to really pay 40 (assuming you buy on release) for is a data update and a quick polish - it makes no difference if the dev team have put thousands of hours into each version if the end-users experience is so stale - its lost sight of the end-user experience, and thats what hurts so much. the adding of in-game purchases is also a massive turn-off for me (and others who have given up on fm sooner than i inevitably will); seriously, micro-payment to increase your clubs bank balance? buy editor access? purchase no transfer restrictions? whose idea was this? its awful.",209.8

"the game is fine in the long term, but the buggy match engine and the tons of injuries are so annoying... my goalkeeper makes a great save and parries it. you would think he would want to get that ball as soon as possible. nope. he takes forever to get up, leaving the opposistion to just tap it in. my wingers keep cutting inside then howling it into row z at least 5 times a match. i have my highlights set to key so when i see memphis depay cut inside, i get all pumped up, and then, nope, he kicks it out of the stadium. the injuries are also annoying. sure its realistic, but every pre season i end up with at least 5 key players getting injured before the opening match of the season. it gets better as the season goes along, and i know its because of low match fitness in pre season, but its stupid. this needs to be fixed. there are some positives though. the scouting and coaching is a lot better than in previous fms, and the transfers are also realistic. the only problem with the transfers is that all the youth players want the same deal and they wont budge at all unless i give them 20k a week. i would recommend this game to a first time fm player, but not if you have previous fms, just stick to them and not buy this buggy game.",118.3

"having played many fm games over the years, i didnt think that the match end could become more painful to watch. seeing your own players move out of the way of the ball has been in the game for ages and its really time this kind of nonsense was fixed. watching a match is like pulling teeth, as your players walk to tackle, move out of their way and let the opposition clean through on goal. had this not cost 17, i would never have bought it because no fm game is worth 30. the game has become so bloated that it has forgotten its core values of what made fm such a great.",35.1

"great addition to the series despite a lot of negativity towards it. the new interface is great and improves on last years version, i do agree to an extent that injuries do get a bit ridiculous towards parts of the season - my most memorable being managing wolfsburg and having 7(!) regular starters injured all within a space of 2-3 months. aside from this, everything else has been great. tactics have been spot on, i also tested a few tactics from the workshop and i was surprised at how good some of them were - but it didnt make an instant difference. some tactics took a good 5-10 games to start flowing nicely, otherwise i would find myself conceding at least 2 goals per game. this year i was focusing solely on gaining most of the achievements rather then spending my life going through season to season with my favourite team. ive been an admirer of these games since championship manager 98 and think ive purchased it every year from then. it is true that a lot of the updates could quite easily come into a nice dlc bundle or same game upgrade, however this is not the case. people should note that they are not forced to buy the game every year, their are plenty of dedicated people within the football manager community that focus on updating the databases for older game titles in order for those to keep playing the old game, with the new data. overall i have loved fm15 and am pleased to say that after all these years, sports interactive are still making good progress in providing a richer and more fulfilling football manager.",141.5

"overall, this year was a disappointment for me. first, i dont like the dark skin. but well, its just my taste. -injuries. everyone mentions about it. i think its not just the number of players injured which is the problem. the problem is the duration of those injuries. while playing with corinthians at some point i had 7 players out for 5-6 months with broken legs. all happened during matches. and i play this game at a good level for 6 years i know how to reduce them. it is just broken. -players are just . just 3 weeks after some jackass signs a new contract, he becomes unhappy with his contract and asking for a new one. if a player is playing well, he becomes unhappy in any case, he wants more salary, a new challenge or is flattered by interest of a bigger club. player is on international duty for 40 days and he becomes unhappy for not being in the first team. same goes with injured players. -i have a squad of 24 players. 21 of them are on international duty and i have a semi final match. game is simply absurdly ed up. you cant make any alterations on your fixture, you cant interact with the fa or your club board for most cases. after all, i could write down a 50-page list on things that are  in the game. i wont. i just want to tell everyone who considers buying the game: i feel like they intentionally made it so  so that we will be forced to buy the ingame editor. there is no way you can play this game unless you buy the ingame editor. keep it in mind.",183.5
"another version. pretty much the same as the others but upgraded. more animations and more....animations. more features as well, apparently, but well get to that soon. i was excited for fm 2015, as i normally am whenever a new version comes out. i start up a save where im unemployed with a sunday league reputation. this time i have to think about the coaching badges as well. i dont want any. i will start at the very bottom. then i experience some rpg attribute thingy. am i a tracksuit manager or a tactical manager? hell if i know. i am both but according to the game i kind of have to choose one or the other. i like the idea but i find it a bit too gimmicky. loading up every single league the game comes with, and a large database. takes me about 15 minutes before i can start playing for real. the game progresses smoothly. no problems being over the recommended player limit, yet. im in the year 2025 now and still no problem. granted, it slows down a bit when changing months, changing year and during transfer deadline days; but i expected that. playing the game itself is a bit like a tiny rollercoaster ride. i love playing the game but there are so many tiny bugs and features that dont work very well. sidebar. i dont mind it but it gives me less room for customised screens. while on the subject customised screens; a complete mess. i warned them about these kind of things on sis forums. small tiny bugs like these might seems small but they will come back and be a bigger issue. its been there for a long, long time and they havent done anything about it. it wasnt prioritised and now theyre struggling to figure out how to fix it. go figure customising screens is a nightmare. columns disappearing left and right, when you have plenty of room on the screen. you just want to adjust the width of one column a few mm. poof an entire column or two, gone. very annoying, as i customise most of my screens. player interactions are just a complete mess and do not work properly. an entire team in outrage because a 17-year old, who wouldnt get anywhere near the bench of my local 10th-tier real-life club. amazing. nobody would care. not even the 17-year old himself. players complaining that they want to play more games. we are in the middle of the bleeding holidays. we dont have another game for 3 months. then comes back and wants to leave because i didnt keep my promise of playing him. were still one and a half month away from our first friendly. then, when i try to sell him, he complains that im trying to force him out of the club. well....kind of, yeah?! you wanted to leave becuase of playing time and me not keeping promises, so now you want to leave, because i was trying to let you leave because you wanted to? player interactions is a big mess. one big negative from me is: tactics screen. lord, oh lord, what have they done?! fm14 had the close-to-perfect tactics screen and then they change it, for no apparent reason. change it to something a thousand times worse. now, to be fair, they have updated the tactics screen with their patches, so it looks a bit better. to a new player, i dont know what to say. i, personally, dont like the tactics screen at all. i simply dont use it. backroom advice. my coaches are still offering me contradicting advice. why the hell would i want my left fullback dribble on the right hand side when you just told me to train him so he doesnt do that anymore?! i could write a whole lot more about the ups and downs with this game but ill just do this: i do enjoy the game quite a bit, but its not the best fm. far away from it. another not-complete version of this game, which i am getting a bit tired of. it seems like its acceptable that this is always a game in progress. it will always be in progress and i understand that. but each released version should feel like a complete product. it doesnt, and it hasnt done that for a long time. people on the forums wants features and more features. on one hand they get applauded for doing so, but when things arent working so well they get the defenders shouting, theyre just a small company. if theyre not so big then stop adding so many features. stop adding more than they can handle, which seems to be the case, more and more each year. more features doesnt equal better product. it also needs to work properly, which it doesnt. this seems like an overly negative review, and it kind of is. but i have to say that i do enjoy this iteration as well. ill still have, probably, over a thousand hours in this game, when fm16 comes out. having a lot of fun. finding it harder, personally, than any other version but i love the challenge. i do recommend this game. make no mistake about that!!! ill leave this review with the things that bothers me the most about this fm2015: cons: - player interactions doesnt work properly - tactics screen x 1000. its just many steps back from what they had. - issue with getting players match fit in lower leagues - too easy overacheiving when you have the right tactic (compared to real life) - scouting is very tedious and doesnt work properly - customising screens doesnt really work",1225.8

"the games have been getting worse since 2012. this game is no fun to play at all and is incredibly frustrating. as most people have mentioned its buggy. the new menu system works for some things (quick access to teams, training etc) but is terrible in others such as the team selection (covered in colours and you have no idea how to even pick a team which results in a steep unnessesary learning curve). then comes the matches, almost every game goes one of 4 ways. you scrape a win/draw. you dominate and go 2-3 goals up and end up loosing somehow. you thump a team 3 or 4-0 or you get thumped yourself. it doesnt seem to matter if your opposition is better or worse than you those are the outcomes. mostly you will scrape a draw/win. to make it worse you can thump a team better than you, then get smashed by a team worse than you the next week! the team talks are basically the same, and as poor as the last couple of years but with an apparantly random outcome of mood in your players (until you get repuation which frankly is impossible). the same goes for press confrences which have mostly been poor and a time waster, slowing the game down, and having a completely unknown outcome. now you have to deal with the press directly before or after a game slowing it further. just give it to your assitant manager, even though they will say crazy things like arsenal will win the league when your playing as tottenham. it may boil down to having to choose you managerial type rpg style which is the worst idea they have ever had. it feels like cheating by giving yourself the highest stats but that is the only way to stand a chance. i dont want to think about my inner workings as a manager/head coach i just want to play the game! it may also come down to learning how your interactions affect the game, this to me is unrealistic and learing how to play a game isnt the same as becoming a better real life manager. the one and only positive is the new scouting system, where you need a good couple of weeks/months to get a full picture of the player/s. though you still need to make sure your scouts are half decent otherwise youll waste a lot of time and money. its just annoyingly poor. i havent even mentined the bugs as there well covered by other reviews. ive played the game since the days of championship manager but this is terrible, frustrating, and worst of all its not fun. dont waste your money.",251.0

"why dont i ever take notice of all the negative reviews? i should have learned from 2013 and 2014 (which i put hours into) that without any competition for decent football manager games, sports interactive were just going to polish a turd and throw it out as new. i wont go into my injury count after 3 games as most people already make mention to the absurd number of injuries. now granted i havent put a lot into this game (well 30 of my hard earned cash was more than enough), but do i really need to put any more time in than i have? it is awful. the same absolute crap they sold last year. it looks a complete mess, it plays like a complete mess and the old random effect seems to be back with regards to results. this game is like taking two dice, rolling them and giving scores to each team. your tactics? mean nothing. your squad of players? mean nothing. you can say this review is based on only 1.2 hours of gameplay and youd be right, but if you add that to the hours sunk into 2014 (which is pretty much the same) and the fact ive played football manager since its championship manager days i do not need to put more hours into seeing this game fall on its  over and over like the last 2 seasons. the game has become over complicated to the point that instead of your knowledge of football being tested, its your patience that this game tests with its absolute random results. results like elche 3 barcelona 0... followed by barcelona 5 atletico 0 and we round off the 3 matches with barcelona 0 real madrid 7 - er... yeah. the same players that got me a 5-0 win also lost to a nothing team by 3, and then destroyed by real madrid. even if i had no tactical knowledge whatsoever in football, barcelona shipping 10 goals in 2 games whilst scoring 5 in another is just absolute horse s**t. in real life id have to put messi in goal and neymar on the bench! to ship 10 as barca! i do prefer to start in the lower leagues mind you, however seeing those results i dont think i like the idea of being hammered 10 or 11-0 every game so stopped short of starting an actual longterm game. i have no doubt there will be players saying you just dont know what youre doing to which ill just get in first with, yes i do - saved you time typing your tired and ill informed response. i have a very good knowledge of footballing tactics, training regimes and how good a player should be in certain positions based on stats, however this game does not reflect any of that. i also know that too many new players can cause issues with morale and so forth. i understand an over heavy training regime could effect the players performance. i know that a 4-3-3 doesnt work... in any top division. i know that introducing new players slowly to the team is sometimes better than throwing them in with a 90 minute debut. ive read tips pages, ive read faqs ive been playing the series and its predecessor since 1992 and usually have a great time taking smaller clubs over, and with time building them into bigger clubs.",95.0

"sports interactive has taken a long look at their primary tactical setup and made changes to make it more relatable to their audience and also more analogous to the influence that real-life managers are able to exert. as long as they keep pulling tricks like this, football manager is a series that will remain evergreen. but the biggest improvement to this game has got to be the match engine, year after year were used to the buggy disappointing experience especially for us 3d users, but from what ive seen out of my first play, currently 18 games into my season excluding friendles i havent seen 1 bug, maybe im lucky but for a beta thats impressive! its much more fluid and all of the new animations that have been added has really added to the realism, the new interface has got to be the biggest plus aswell alot more cleaner kinda looks like a andriod tablet set up with the left hand bar down the side, and even when youre scrolling down youre squad list or scout list it feels alot more optimized.. the game has improved big time on processing speeds, im running the same size database with the same leagues as before, england, scotland, spain, brazil, portugal, mls, france and germany and the rest of the leagues on view only with a player base of 92,000 which doesnt struggle, which was one of the down points of fm14 although it was fast there was sometimes youd be going to youre browser while you were waiting, theyve also added a new feature where you can choose youre licence and past playing experience which i found to be pretty amazing, although i havent fully understood it yet but ill be sure to update this when i do, i havent tried classic mode as of yet, but looking foward to having a go at it hopefully theyve improved it this year with less clutter and more stats! all in all i have to give this game a 9/10 which is pretty damn impressive for a beta! one last thing.. we still have leaderboards, was getting scared as i was seeing tons of ruhmours about it not being in this years version but they were proved wrong, hopefully workshop comes back this year too. i will be updating this once the offical release on novemember the 7th,",1917.6
"worst fm ever , even 2013 was way better , so a patch ago , everyone was marking over 4-5 goals per game. they fixed it ok , i can wait a bit , now new patch . every free kick = goal , every corner = goal . you dominate all the game and lose vs a corner/freekick. their goalkeeper is a freaking ninja , yours sucks , attributes dont matter regarding the goalkeeper. aguero from man city is a beast , he can mark goals from every position , ive played countless times vs man city , apparently aguero never misses ( i do not expect to win vs city, but i do not expect to get a goal from every aguero ball touch, yes i did marked him and asked my defenders to break his legs) . this game killed my nerves , i used to play fm 14 for countless hours and not with big teams, i was struggling my way up. here if you play vs a big team , regardless of your tactics , you will concede at least 3-4 goals. another bug chelsea has the line throw ups like they are corners, if the opposition player has better stats, your defender will not even try getting the ball, cause that player is imba, your defenders will just watch him go around , not even try to get the ball, at least seeing them try and fail would do, not just seeing them trying to stare the ball out of the opposition. else what can i say ? this game is not worth buying or playing, unless of course you wait 20 patches so they can fix every issue , cause they dont have beta testers or if they have , those guys are . this game was a waste of money/time.",34.5

"there is certainly a lot more going on in this years iteration of fm - certain elements have been changed massively from the fm14 look, whilst some have received only a mild tweaking. this tends to be the case nearly every year and dont always result in an improved product the changes made this year have largely been pleasing, although in particular i am not a fan of the new tactics board. it seems like the information i need is still there but it is hidden behind extra menus and mouse clicks, generally creating what feels to me like an inefficient system when compared to fm14. the gameplay has remained largely the same and is familiar to anyone who has spent time with the series. the engine seems to have been improved in some areas and regressed in others, again mirroring previous versions of the game. there seem to be more goals going in, more goals from crosses and set pieces, and more defensive errors. the game also seems harder and learns an inflexible managers tactics rather quickly. i only use the 2d classic view so cant comment on the 3d match engine, i have never used it or had any interest in it. fundamentally, its still great fun to build and develop a team, to argue with other managers and to lead your club to glory or glourious defeat. i would definitely recommend this to anyone with more than a passing interest in the franchise and it represents a solid return on investment in terms of new features and gameplay hours.",253.5

"i was more than happy to splash out on fm15 when it was released and looked forward to playing the updated game. how wrong could i be this game is beyond flawed , i gave it half a season first time round then went back to fm14 . i then waited for the january update and went back to it , to find the game slightly more playable only for without warning all the glitches in the match engine to return as soon as i hit november. first ever game with southampton was horrendous. 4 pre seaons games and i lost pelle/tadic/wanyama and alderwield all to injuries of 3-4 months. first league game 2-0 up with 10 mins to go at home to palace. beat 3-2. there was obviously a fault with the number of serious injuries your team received , i was using all my subs to replace injured or players carrying knocks. my latest save with lazio has been the final straw. first 6 games - cessena (a) won 3-0 , genoa (h) won 6-1 , empoli (h) won 3-1 , verona (a) won 4-1 , juventus (a) won 2-1 , parma (h) won 1-0. now everything was looking fantastic my team were conceding very few goals , dominating possesion and chances created in every game and the players all seemed to be carrying out there roles as instructed. on top of that klose was banging in the goals with 8 in his first 6 games. however it was at the parma game that everything suddenly went horrendously wrong for seemingly no reason. i have to make 3 subs in the first 30 mins because of injury , i then change team instructions to stand off opponenets and stay on feet apparently that doesnt work and i receive 2 red cards in quick succession. even going ultra defensive and playing on the counter with 9 men , i still totally outplay parma but despite creating numerous chances all are fired off target or there keeper starts making wonder saves. i had also signed victor valdes on a free transfer so now he was match fit , i put him into my starting 11 in place of a mediocre keeper i did have. thinking hopefully now i have a decent goalkeeper all should be good. next 6 games. udinese (a) drew 0-0 , roma (h) drew 2-2 , empoli (h) italian cup won 2-0 , ac milan (a) lost 1-0 , torino (h) lost 2-0 , palermo (a) lost 3-0 only thing that seems to have improved is the reduction in injuries to players during matches. that being said i know lazio are in rome but training must involve swords and be held at the collosium as at least 5 first choice players have missed games with injuries picked up during training . now surely this cant happen my team that was performing so well has now lost the ability to do anything. klose has no goals in last 6. i seen penalties missed in the udinese/roma and ac milan games. players seem to be running in quick sand as the chase down through balls. and world class goalkeeper couldnt catch a cold, his positioning is terrible seems to run out and conceedes all his goals from nothing shots at his near post . the roma game was nearly the final straw. i had led 1-0 and 2-1 and then watch roma come back and equalise the next minute. then go 3-2 up only for it be chopped off. the game is obviously full of glitches and bugs, and to make it worse these now seem to be creeping there way into the updates for fm14 . si games and sega desperatly need to get there finger out and get these fixed as from what im reading in the reviews all the fans of the series are at there wits end with how bad this version of the title is. it does pain me to say this but avoid this game if you are a fan of the series or someone contemplating taking it up as you will be put off for life.",47.4

"worst 29.99 ive spent on a game. this is my first review, which will probably show, but i felt i had to warn people. i was really looking forward to getting this game and thought it looked amazing when i first started playing it. the stadia and player animation are great, and the feel of the pre-match game itself is good. training and scouting are easy to manage, as is the creation of friendly matches. board and player interaction is fine, and i particularly like how whole team chats work. if only i could say the same for the rest of it. i am currently half way through my fourth season and am so frustrated with the game. ive given it a reasonably good chance (check my hours played... not as many as others, granted, but still quite a bit considering the flaws in the game.) and here i am, sitting ***as usual*** with half my first team medium or long term injured. ive hired better physios, tweaked training to ensure that it wasnt too strenuous and ensured that my coaches were well matched to training routines. still its happening. ive checked others reviews and plenty of people are finding the same. si need to resolve this. the game is completely unrealistic in this area, and its spoiling it for myself and others who have, sadly, paid good money for the pleasure of playing it. the other big fault is the performance of goalies when the match engine is running. i mean, a 23 cap goalie with 17/20 for one on ones standing with hands on hips with messi bursting into the penalty box?? goalies with high stats for jumping reach and agility unable to reach a chest height shot from a marauding opposition defender?? a new update came in today, and i was hoping at least one of these two problems would be sorted. i played four matches against mediocre sides. 1-2, 0-4, 1-0 (woohoo!) and 0-3. im no fm tactical expert, but im not by any means a noob or a rookie. ive been playing si football management games each year since championship manager 93 (yep, 1993 <grabs flat cap, pipe and slippers>), have in past games won plenty of back to back promotions, won european trophies and plenty of league championships. i buy players specifically to fit my systems and use their info to adjust strategies. my understanding of tactics cant be that bad. of all the 20 odd si games in the original cm/ fm series that ive played, this one is the most inconsistent and most frustrating of all of them. in the four matches played today, in addition to the 6 long/ mid term injured first team players out, i had injuries as follows: game 1 - cm and wb both out 9-11 days game 2 - no injuries(!) game 3 - cm, cd and lone striker all out between 9-11 days and 3 weeks each. game 4 - wb out 6 days. oh... and a training injury to my 2nd best wb - out for 2 weeks from half way between game 3 and game 4. will probably have wait until fm 2016 before these flaws are resolved. people have been raising them on forums for months now and nothing has been done. however, sis attention will most likely be firmly on thinking on the next game in the series. unlikely that anyone from si will read this, but if they do - remember that people have paid for this game, guys. im pretty sure that from what i remember cm and fm games used to be delayed until the match engine was just right. that was worth it. this time, its been comparatively all looks and no substance, which is a real shame. for now, im going back to playing champ manager 93-94 on my old amiga (anyone remember them??)... 18 players called tadeusz kruszinski and only english leagues available, but at least it had a match engine that worked!",94.7
"this game ing sucks, do not buy it. whatever tactic/formations you play youll lose games you should win, probably by something like 2-6. amazing how much this franchise has gone down hill.",224.8

"full of problems, pretty s**t overall. better off downloading an updated database for fm14.",1871.9
"the most frustrating fm ever. can batter teams and still lose. have a 3 goal lead, winning easily and then somehow draw. im afraid its all too predictable. for example, was getting beat at home 3-1 by spurs. clawed it back to 3 a piece but i knew it was going to let them score a winner in the 90th minute and it did. really unimpressed and wish i never bothered buying it. if youre thinking about buying it stick with fm2014 because this version is piss poor.",78.6
"this game keeps having serious errors which crash the game and delete my save completly!!!! getting really annoying and theyre contact department are never any help. massive fan of the franchise but this years effort is poor on the system",320.3
"i have had football manager since 2010, enjoyed playing iit greatly for years. i enjoyed the ability to micromanage the little things in the game mainly the sliders. if my team was getting scored on a great deal move thedefensive line slider back a few notches of which i had twenty. a few years ago they decided to do away with the sliders but keep them optional to simplify the game. fine i still have them... the last few years completly gone, and its obvious to anyone who plays the game that the system is exactly the same, the player and team instructions are still moving sliders in the background. so i am at the point where i am just not interested in the game anymore, i am sure there are people out there that like to tinker and micromanage their games, people that enjoy games like europa universalis 4 or crusader kings 2. football manager has been one of my favorite games i hope they can listen to their fans and bring back what we all loved about the game.",42.7

"i dont know how to break this news to anyone... especially si-games.. if they are even interested enough to read these reviews. but .. well i sort of rolled into fm back in 2010... which is not as long ago as some of you, but long enough to make a valid opinion i think. i really do am glad that the time of cardboard public around the field is history, believe me. i usually play fm when i wake up.. and am in no way, shape, or form, capable to play any action game whatsoever, being as old as i am... so i love to start my day with fm... to each his own right ?... you should know... i once was a rather fanatical ajax fan.. started out at 7 years old... but those times are over since 1997... ajax utterly ruined that... and destroyed their true fans in the process.. i still love the game though.. eventhough these days... it seems to me more like a bussiness with emplyees, then a a club with club-honor, and real die-hard fans. ... and sorry to say... fm mirrors that a bit... but let me tell you first of all.. i hate mandatory. something from my youth no doubt. and the mandatory team chat of fm14 was a sharp pain to live with... i usually did those with my eyes closed, and got out at the first chance i got... not even knowing what i just said i wanted to hear... now.. in fm15.. when you finally have a first team together that plays well.. like each other, win more games then they lose... chances are that some damn snot-nose from the second or 3rd team comes asking for first-team foortball.. sigh. you look at his stats and just laugh.... i have been a footballer myself, some time ago, obviously... on quite a high level even, mind you.. even played for ajax a few weeks... before i failed the medical... but i wouldnt have dared go to the first team manager and ask him to be in his team or.... ill be unhappy ?...... ha.. he would recommend me to cry a while on my mommys lap.. or if that wouldnt be good enough... give me the number of a good shrink, and send me off with a slap on the back of my head... and quite rightly so... in past fm games i never gave them the time of day.. if anyone was any good, his own trainer or my chief schout would tip me of on his existence or progress... and that was it... now.. in fm15.. it is mandatory to speak to this snotnose... really ?.... and if i decline.. half my team will be saying that i handled him unfairfly... so gone balance, gone ... arggghhh..., and then i havent told you about, that if you have a really important game.. 90% chance your best striker will tear a muscle on the trainings field.. one or two days before the match... and will be unavailable... for 3 bloody months. have i told you yet how many times one of our stikers is offside in one single game ?... 10723548303-times... thats how many.. now... i seen enough games.. been to games... played enough games... to know that this is utterly unrealistic at best.. and plain imposible usually... if my midielder launches a long ranged shot... it comes back from the opposite team keeper who could only parry it... and my striker scores from the rebound... it is not offside.... thats a blatant lie... the whisle goes, and the comments say the whisle had already gone.... no .. it did not... it just went... so even if my striker was offside, your bloody whistle should have been going the second the ball left my midfielders foot... not a minute later when my stiker scores the rebound... you incompetent . besides... half my players look like in albinos... white as snow... very irritating... also players warp all over the field on occasion... which is rather immercive breaking, up to the point where it is rediculus... i know... you can not win all games.. that should be obvious to anyone... (unless you cheat) but when spirits are high, moods at at top level... every one in the team is top fit and inspired to win... there is no bloody way, that my team suddenly cant play anymore... passes wrong, misses headers, gets yellow and red cards all over the place... there is no.. bloody... way.... sure.. even with everything good and in place... then we could still lose the game.. it happens... but not with a team that looked like i just fielded a 3rd team of incompetant todlers.. that seemed completely incapable to even hit a ball.. let alone pass it right... okay.... those who know me, know i will always give you the truth as i see it... which, obviously, isnt the ultimate truth... what is ?.... but.... after having played fm15 for as long as it is out... and having played fm10 -fm11 - fm12 - fm13 and fm14 to death... i simply cannot recommend fm15 and live with myself. i love this game.., i really do... but i hate fm15.. still.. i do not regret buying it, simply because i have gotten so much pleasure out of the previous installments that i dont mind giving the folks at si some donation... but i think i will go back to fm14.. and hope fm16 will be better.... or maybe.. even fm15 with some patching... who knows ?.... but as things stand.. i can not recomend this version of football manager to anyone... unless you are a masocist.. so.. i am sorry si.. but i simply can not.. guys and girls.. do yourself a faviour.. stay on fm14 .. or if you are new to this game... buy fm14.. not fm15.. trust me.. you wont regret it... fm15 is one long big pester campaign... made to ruin your day completely... it is in no way any fun... and it will put you off on one of the best, if not the best football manager simulation games around... i am sorry to say. (edit) the latest patches have really done some good to this game... i can now sometimes stomach it sometimes... if not too long... ill keep fm14 installed for now.... but.... keep up the good work si.. and maybe one day i might have to change my review to a more positive recomendation... one can only hope...",163.1
"literally any interface feature you can think of from fm2014 got screwed up. search function is incredibly laggy, and slow and makes it unable to use. lots of options that i frequently use are now many more clicks away. the new interface is just not practical, have to click so many times and feels so much slower to play than the 2014 version. im not gonna get myself any more annoyed by the stupid design of this game. for someone who spent hundreds of hours having fun with the 2010-2014 versions of the game, i wont even play this version more than the 10hrs i did untill now, unless they make a decent interface like in fm 2014. si, you just lost a fm-fan. also i had to wait for a few updates and change the game preferences to make it even playable at all, weeks after purchase. goodbye 50 for !",11.0

"i read all the negative reviews before getting this game but i bought it anyway to see for myself. that was in early december. i still havent been able to get a good save going yet despite my best efforts. for some unknown reason, the better the club you choose, the more injuries you get. (anything from 1-4 injuries a game in the prem). anyone who has played previous versions of the game will know that the interface has always been a bit boring but really easy and handy to know where everything is. in 15, theyve taken into account the slightly uninspiring interface but have shuffled it all about really badly and you have to re-learn where everything is, the main top bar has been moved to the left side of the screen...its just confusing. fm 15 takes their you will concede 2 or 3 in stoppage time rule to the next level, its virtually impossible to hold on to a lead. it doesnt matter if your team has great composure, bravery, team work, concentration etc, you will always concede goals in the final minutes. basically, if your team is 1-0 up at the 75th minute mark, you may as well turn your computer off. i was playing as man city. on three occasions i was 1-0 up in the 85th minute. i did three different things each time. 1st game - i dropped back and defended my lead. i lost 2-1. (vs stoke) 2nd game - i pushed up and uninvited pressure, i played the offside trap. i lost 3-1 (vs west brom) 3rd game - i changed to a 6-5-0. every player on the pitch went into a defensive position to block the goal. i lost 2-1. (vs crystal palace) it happens 9/10 times. fair enough but when it happens so frequently its just screams broken. you end up losing your lead in a burst of sudden energy from the other team. what makes it happen? its almost half scripted. if im ahead at half time i always think to myself it doesnt matter, ill still lose. i downvote this game because it is simply against you. not in a challenging way but in more of a  you way.",683.5

"bought this game at christmas. i bought the download version. when i play a match, there is no sound. sometimes when i validate the game cache, sound does play in match. having to verify my cache everytime i want to play a game is not good, due to the fact that it rartely works, and takes a while. i went into game, the guy tried to send me packing, telling me the usual nonsense that it wasnt bought there etc. anyway, to cut a long story short, the guy phoned up someone (steam maybe) and i was told to contact them with my order number/date etc. its now been 6 days, and i still have had no reply. this is shocking. the game was purchased on the 25/12/14. it is now 14/01/15 and my game is still not even being looked into. also, i have read a lot of bad reveiws/bugs upon researching ways to fix the sound. if you want to be treated like this, then this game is for you.",241.4

"i was really disappointed with the previous football manager (2014) so i couldnt bring myself to pay out of my own wallet for it this year. i got this as a gift for christmas and thought you know what, lets give sports interactive another chance. i started as unemployed and took the morcambe job in the middle of the season, i spent the best part of an hour and a half setting up training, bringing in coaches, creating a good tactic and getting to know my squad. within 20 minutes of my first match my keeper catches a lazy effort from 30 yards out, only to turn around stroll back into his own net with the ball clutched in hands. quit game, uninstall.",9.3
"i cant recommend this game despite it improving in many ways from previous versions. the reason for this is the focus on player interaction this year. players have always got unhappy for not getting enough game time, too much competition etc. this year not only does this happen more frequently but often without any justification. you then get to try to talk them round which almost always ends in half the squad becoming unhappy. at this point team morale is very low (meaning you lose a lot) and the only way to turn this around is to try and sell most of the team before you get sacked. hopefully si will fix this in the next patch.",647.6
"i cant say its a good game. well, to be fair, not a good soccer game. i played fm since it was still called cm (cm3). i had a good memory with the series, but this game seems to be ridiculous. the first thing is the injury. my amc, 2 mcs and 1 winger in the first broken their legs/ribs during my first season. my striker was injured frequently. i never see a real team has a such bad condition. second, the defending system is poor. i can not stop ai scoring, sometimes just from no reasons. they can shoot from 30 yards and scored. they can easily score after 45 mins, no matter i asked my team to be focused or i praised them and asked them to keep up. i set a counter mind, they scored. i played defensive games, they scored. i contained my lads in the box, they still scored. i lost countless games when i was leading by 2 or more goals (like i said, i cant stop ai scoring). the only comfort is that sometimes, i can score a lot either. but having games like 4-4, 5-6, 4-3 every 2 or 3 weeks is not normal at all. i dont use big clubs, but it never troubled me in previous versions. now the game is not fun to me anymore since i dont want to start in a big club. perhaps using a rich club and buy expensive players will solve the problem? i can see that they put a lot of attention in setting the so called interaction part. i have to take interviews in order to get a job. more players wanted to talk to me for personal issues. these are fun. but there were still some bugs. some players wanted to talk to me to ask for a leave. fine, i asked them to stay. but they insisted to leave. ok, i clicked their names to double check the coach report to make sure whether i still need the player. great, i wanted him to stay, so i clicked back in order to continue the conversation. wait... what do you mean i have spoken to the player? several days later , other players will blame me because i treated the one talked to me badly. what the heck? seriously? remember, the most important aspect of fm is the soccer simulation. you will continue losing players like me if you still maintain such a terrible match system.",50.8
"i pre-ordered the game a few moneths ago and had been desperately excited for it ever since. however, i have to say it is probably the worst version in years. i appreciate the need to change certain aspects of the gamplay and format in order to develop and move forward, but im afraid to say that this attempt has, if anything, moved the game backwards. dont get me wrong, i will still play it religiously and undoubtedly enjoy it in the process as i have done over many years now, but i cant help but feel disappointed with the outcome of this seasons product.",114.9

"get the snacks ready guys, this is going to be a long one... ive been playing fm properly since 09 and this visually is definately the most pleasing on the eye, although it is expected with most games that are in a series, each year graphics improve etc.. but ive noticed in previous years the creators talk about our new and improved match engine!!!!!! whereas, in reality, it isnt much different but i have to admit, this year there is a difference. the 3d match engine is actually really evident! football manager to me was always a game that every part of it seemed as close to realism as it could yet when it came to the matches it just let the whole feel of realism down a touch. the players movement looks better, the shooting, passing, diving, tackling all just looks better, although i dont think they thought through the appearence of players that well.. e.g. aaron cresswell (west ham left back) had ginger hair in my game? the interface of the menu screens has had a huge revamp, in previous years the interface had hardly changed and it kind of made me question in what is the point in buying a game that looks the same, just maybe updated teams (hence the reason i stopped buying fifa) but this game actually looks like a new game, to a certain extent. the originial drop down bar which is now down the left side of the screen is a great feature, with added tabs in the bar it makes navigating around quicker which for me makes the game more enjoyable, but that is just a personal preference. im not sure if its to do with the game itself but from the last time i played fm14 until now i had upgraded my pc and bought a high-end graphics card so the general visual aspects of the game may vary depending on your own pcs gpu but for me it looks great, especially with the added facepacks, bages, kits etc. the actual features of the game have been improved aswell, the tactics screen has had a complete change to selecting players and player roles, including new roles, which once i got use to the functions of it all seemed like a good way they have upgraded from the normal tactics, drag and drop & click 2 buttons, done. i havent played as much as some but long enough i think to make a judgement on the game and i appreciate that the game is still in beta and will have some bugs, like 9 of my first squad players getting injured in pre-season and my cb getting sent-off 4 game he played in a row, but come november 7th on full release i think we will all have a fantastic game to enjoy for the next 12 months, be it if your a experienced fm player like myself or if its the first time picking up the game & if you are a newbie little tip for you, coaches will save your season! but anyway guys, work tommorow and its way past my bed time, hopefully we can all enjoy this new fm installment! cherriooo :)",81.8
"its just not ready. i really like the new look, sidebar, scouting, match graphics its all very nice. its going to be a great game. its playable but i wouldnt start a long term save until some of the problems get sorted out. injuries, for some, are out of control. crosses are overpowered, too many long range shots, too many goals a lot of 5-0, 7-4 games. every year you get a release that needs to be patched before you can fully enjoy it. this year is no different. you see a lot of people upset and give bad reviews, understandable. if i paying for a game i want a finished product. im half way into a chelsea save and have seen a lot of injuries early when the players were out of shape, training was heavy and tactics were fast. after some tweaking they stopped. i am seeing overpowered crosses, terry scores a hattrick! some high scoring games. once those issues get patched, hopefully soon and not feb, which seem to be just adjustments this game is going to be a great game. buy it, check out the new features, get all your pics and logos ready, test out tactics and play a few test games so youll be ready.",195.0

"having put in 1000 or so hours into the 2011, 2012, and 2013 versions altogether, i can safely say that football manager 2015 is the worst ive played so far. and not worst as in its still enjoyable, worst as in its just not a good or fun game anymore. something has been changed since those games that i cant explain. sides with the best defence in the leage concede 4 in the first 10 minutes of the game; the top 4 teams in real life lounge around in lower mid table positions; youth players ask for wages of a consistent first team player. and the match engine, dear god the match engine. players are clearly fouled but the referees do nothing. players simply stand and watch as others walk past them. tackles are so few and far between that im not sure playing defenders is worth it. and scores with 8 goals or more are not nearly as rare as they should be. if you want to play football manager, get 2012 or 2013. because this one sucks.",69.0
"two main things really get me angry about the fm series. first off the match engine is not something to be expected for a anno 2014 game. without getting more detailed, it is obvious that si doesnt want this to be improved, as modern technology at tjis point really could offer something a hundred times better. wake up si, were not handheld here. ps: praise the lord that this sh*t is still better than eas fifa manager.... . the second most important thing for me is the pretty low amount of team licences offered by the game. this really bugs me because, even if you play a manager game for the management style, you still have that favorite team, it really bugs me how si doesnt have team licences for first division teams across europe....",150.0

"skip this one. i went back to 2014 fairly quickly after the excitement of trying a new fm had faded. there are some nice additions to the game, but theyve also changed what wasnt broken, and in doing so have destroyed the realistic play seen in 14. the match engine, with some new graphical additions off the pitch which are quite cool, is simply nowhere near good enough for general release. the redesign of the players and their animations is atrocious. if you can watch a match and not notice the hilarious arms of the players then youre lyring to yourself. this is more like an experiment with ragdoll physics than a football match engine. players plod about the pitch with no real life in them, the ball moves poorly, and the pitches now look bogged down and ugly as hell no matter where you are. tactics are not easy to really see in the match itself, nothing is realistic in terms of the way the team moves the ball, and thats on top of the horrible animations. keepers are a little better animated, and as i mentioned the stadiums have more detail and things, but that doesnt make up for the core element of the game being so badly designed. fm2014 isnt perfect, but the match engine craps all over this one from a great height. gone are the days of your lightning winger flying past his full back and getting a cross in, now they waddle around with all the urgency of a bored duck. theres no more slick passing moves that take into account your tactical instrucions, the ball now moves so slow.. and the poor new sound effect for the ball being hit doesnt help.. again, it just sludges around the pitch to no great effect. the colours of shirts and things are also far too bright, for no reason, this wasnt present in 2014. there are things i really like, female managers, extra things to say to players, a way to convince players your club is the one for them, the sidebar being more intuitive, and things generally being placed in area where theyre more easy to find and helpful than previous. working my way through pre-season i was absolutely enthralled with this game, until the first friendly kicked off and the immersion just vanished in front of my eyes. how pale are the really white players now?! they look ill! arms are pathetic, tricks are pathetic, the whole thing looks far less graphically impressive than 14 which is hardly fifa level to begin with. theres no excuse for this, and no way to return the game and spend the money on something else like both seasons of walking dead! get fm2014 with a good skin and all the badges, logos etc. from the workshop and save yourself some money on this, checking back in october to see if theyve reworked the engine, if not then i might have to finally say si have lost their way.",23.7

"having read many of the other reviews, i felt compelled to provide my own. please note that my play time is considerably more than is logged, since i play mostly offline currently. as expected this version of the game isnt perfect. some of the criticisms outlined in other reviews are accurate, however i must argue against a couple of points made. firstly the match engine seems fine to me. i seem to score relatively regularly and concede a few here and there, as one might expect. it doesnt seem unbalanced from my point of view, but then i suppose i dont always expect it to work everytime just because i want it to, and rather i work on my tactics to make them more effective. secondly, a couple of other reviews complain about the new confusing layout. while i admit i had a hard time finding certain things initially within the sidebar, it really doesnt take long to get used to it and, indeed, i actually rather like the new look. this game takes the solid foundations set by football manager 2014 as a huge improvement over the problematic 2013 version, and builds on it. it gives a fresh new look, which isnt something i would have said it needed but now its here, i like it. in summary then, from my own personal experience, this game is very good indeed. it improves in subtle ways on the previous entry in the series, and from what ive seen so far it doesnt really take anything away either. make of this what you will, those people who complain might disagree with me, but then im not from the school of instant success or gtfo. buy it, if you are a fan of the series. i picked it up for a little over 20, and id say for the amount ill play it, that makes it the bargain of the year.",14.1

"i just dont understand. i have played fm 2013 quite regulary, its not perfect but its accessible. i have always made light of the match engine, yes it has its problems but it has never angered me to the point that i feel its actively working against me. fm 2015 has some really unique in depth features, compared to fm 13 more events happen between players, pre-match build up and the scouting system feels much more accurate. the problem i am having here, is that i dont think i have really played enough to review the game, i just know that i have played enough to not reccomend it to anyone. match preperation was a great part of the game, yet my formations are never trained enough in pre-season, even with a very high workload. i wouldnt mind if this also applied to the teams i am not in control of, it is entirely evident though that this is not the case. with time, i think i could become invested in this game, however the turmoil of early game problems has led me to return to an earlier version of the game for my fm fix. just go and play an earlier version and save yourself the trouble. *edit* after spending several more hours, i simply cant get into this game. theoretically, the more accurate aspects of this years release should create a better fm experience, yet this is simply not the case. the plethora of new tactical roles just bemuddles the overall system, i really question if even half of these are used frequently in the real life game, especially outside of the top flight of leagues. i think overall enjoyment has been sacrificed on the altar of depth, if you want a tactical system which requires constant maintenance and player recruitment which takes hours of trawling through players and weeks upon weeks of scouting reports, i could possibly reccomend this game over previous releases. also, the new interface is absolutely shocking. luckily the workshop provides some good alternatives.",22.4
"there arent much changes from 13, i didnt purchase 14 because i knew there wasnt gonna be some huge updates and changes. sigames merely refined the game and touched up on some areas in 2015. they tried to shift the reliance of fmscout(genie) by allowing us to scout for potential and consistency of players. but, the scouting ui system is terrible... imagine scouting over 200-300+ players, and after the initials reports those players who didnt make the cut, you will have to remove them one by one manually.... genie is still the choice for me, its just too convenient... it was refreshing for maybe the first few days, after that you will realise its actually the same old thing being repackage with some minor tweaks and improvements. buy it if you are a real diehard football or fm fan, if not just stick to your 13/14.",289.4
"i had this sitting on my wishlist for more than a month before i decided to risk everything and buy it. i was hoping to get it on sale but i got so bored with my other games i couldnt wait any longer. being a long time player of the ea fifa manager series (now discontinued) and a one time player of fm years ago, and read all the recent bad reviews i thought i was going in with my eyes open. i knew what i wanted in a football manager game and this one just didnt deliver - particularly on the matchday experience. everything was cool to begin with, having to go for job interviews to get a manager gig, etc. i thought that was unique. the whole build up to match day was good, choosing tactics, and formations, etc. its all very very detailed. i was quite happy to tinker for hours before i decided to plough through to a friendly match. then i was presented with the most god-awful ui for match day, and a 1980s 3d rendition of a football match which i eventually turned it 2d mode because i couldnt stand it. for a game that has been around for how long, this 3d match engine is appalling. they would be much better off just having a text ticker for gameplay rather than a half-a55ed attempt at a 3d game engine. i hated the interface for actual match play. way too much clutter, nothing intuitive. you could only have 1 or 2 widgets up and running at a time. it really hasnt been thought out well. i wish i could take the ui and match engine from fifa manager and plug it into this - it would be much more appealing to me. *sigh* another wasted $50. they do refunds around here? update: ironically within hours of this review it went on sale in steam *aaaaaaarghhhhh*",6.4

"football manager 2015 is a manager simulation game which is designed to put you in charge of teams within the footballing world. you can buy/sell as you please as well as hire/fire staff as you please and you ride the highs and lows of football management. if youve played the older versions of this game this game is a slight improvement upon them. this version has added extra features and improvements which most are very much in the background. truth be told the same issues with the preivous versions still exist in this version to a certain extent, such as the ai (at times in rare cases) is very frustrating and downright poor. ai issues have been adressed in the latest update, but much like many other games the orignal version was released unfinished/unpolished. much like the fifa franchise this game slightly improves elements such as graphics and adding one or two features which in my opinon is unacceptable there is alot of potentail and the creators should look to improve much more (such as the match engine and overall media/player interaction). to be more positive the game is fun, challengeing and does feel like an improvement the match engine is getting better and the accuracy of transfers between clubs is better, however the next version must have significant improvement in order to prevent the franchise from becoming stale. for football fans who enjoy the small details involed with football and would ratrher be at the helm of a club rather than a player this game is for you. overall an addictive game and a slight improvement and a solid edtion to a franchise with high potential. 6/10 (upon release) 8.5/10 (latest update).",258.3

"its wierd at first and the default skin is terrible but after a few hours into it you start to get used to it. scouting is actually allot more important than ever now and you go into your scouting tab in order to search for players that are transfer listed etc, based on your scouting knowledge. you can see how everything is working allot more now and makes it important to have feeder clubs from different countries to improve scouting knowledge across the globe. touchline instructions are cool in theory but i found it to be pointless and makes your team worse off, just stick with the pre match and half time team talks. match engine is allot better and it feels more fluid with the animations however are there some dodgy stuff that happens especially when 2 or 3 defenders are trying to chase down a loose ball then none of them end up getting it and leave it whilst a surging striker latches onto it and scores when they shouldent of had any chance of getting it. the only bad thing really for me is the default skin but thats a personal thing, as for the game its solid and a solid upgrade. if youve not got a fm game for a while then deffo pick this up, if you get them every year then you should see more improvements this year than you have the previous years to warrent getting it aswell.",314.4

"will probably be the last football manager i buy, been playing since champ 01/02 and maybe ive been playing fm for too long but the game is just too easy, can take a team from league 2 to the champions league in 5/6 years almost everytime, in lower leagues you can pickup players on free transfers 2 leagues above the standard you play, in the prem you pickup players from argentina/brazil for 4m and sell them for 30m at the end of the season, not fun for me anymore",506.8
"i have enjoyed my time so far as acmilan manager within fm2015. it is a game that like 2014 ramped up the difficulty and you have to have a team throughly prepared. you also have to be very careful in what you say, not only to the players but to the media. morale has an impact in the games like 2014 and long streaks of losses can be brought on if you are not up to the mark in man management. there are some dodgy goal keeper animations that often cause goals (rare off the wall scorelines), and often times follow up conversations with players that dont quite relate to the previous conversation, but they are not exactly game breakers. the game has brought in a much more streamlined interface that i have found a very welcome addition. i have always found the news an irritaion and have waited for the return of how 2010 had the headlines away from the inbox and i have found 2015s way much more to my liking. the game is very enjoyable and one of the few that often has me making noises when goals are missed or penalties given, it is nice to get that sort of immersion. setting up your profile as manager and being able have coaching stats and ratings to use in game are great, finally running the training yourself will have a greater effect. i really like it the positives outweight the negatives by a long way and have found it the most enjoyable fm since 2010. the game engine is good, the management detail is fantastic. the scouting has been revamped, i like the uncertainty brought in with vague ratings eg. passing 16-19. i like that teams try very hard to hold onto their good players, for example i found a future star according to all my scouts, his value was below 1mil, but the team he was with knew what i did and would only sell him for 42mil. i recommend it, its worth every penny for the management fan or football fan alike.",441.3
"better than fm 2014 but still awful and unrealistic. terrible passing, countless corners, through balls are very rare, player attributes still has no effect ( mertesacker is faster than bale and ronaldo)",407.3

"sensationally good game, following in the footsteps of its predecessors. the genius of its improvements are in the constant simplification of its features which makes it equally accessible to either hardcore football fans, casual gamers or indeed both.",247.7
"ive been a cm/fm player since cm 00/01, so i think in can say it with some property: fm is a great football managing game, always were and still is, but this year beta edition was totally flawed, literally broken. as of beta 15.0.3 most of those bugs were solved. now i had only observed a few bizarre defensive errors and some excessive red cards, but i can safely say that this game will be proper in the release date. good job si! there was some good additions as the rpg like feature to estipulate your manager skils and the possibility of team talking during the matches, not only in half or full time. also i liked the new scouting system, its not only more beautiful and easier to adapt as it seens to be more effective. the tactical screen was also improved, its now more reallistic and fluid with some nice additions to the tactical options. ill list the main bugs that affected this game until the beta 15.0.3 and update their situation as si realizes the patches. all of them i observed in all my 3 saves (playing in spanish, italian and brazilian leagues propositaly with top clubs: real madrid, juventus and cruzeiro): . lots of goals (bizarre gk and defensive errors, lots of own goals). this was totally adressed in the 15.0.3 update. there still some keeper and defensive errors, but most of them seems acceptable as this is a football simulation game. still, there are very few defensive errors (especially with wing/full backs) that seems a bit unrealistic. . iconstancy (long winning and losing streaks without apparent motives): as ive said, im propositaly playing with top clubs so, as of beta 15.0.3, im experiencing long winning streaks with some unlucky draws and some loses to stronger teams, something closer to what one can expect playing with these teams. . bizarrely high frequency of yellow and red cards (3,4 or 5 reds in one game, all games of the round having red cards). this seems to have been adressed but still happens sometimes. i know some football games tend to be very violent, but having 3 red cards in two games of the same round in the spanish league it still seems fishy to me. . excessive player transfers demands and team meetings. this also seems to be adressed. players now seem more mature as when to ask for a transfer and of when to call a team meeting, but there still some bugs, as when llorente asked me a new contract and i promised to give him one in the end of the season. he accepted but the next day he was mad at me because i didnt agreed with a new contract straight away (and called a team meeting of course). or when one of the younger players asked me for a transfer in the very first day after the window closed. and not adressing your players demands severely hinder their morale and their performances now! . i still dont like the ui, but i guess ill just have to adapt to it. this game now is totally playable and im pretty sure that si will manage to correctly patch him untill the release date! a must buy for all football fans, as always!",352.7

"i love this game and have been playing it for around 12 years. although i do enjoy this version there is still alot wrong with it. the game day match engine is just not good enough and if it doesnt improve they should just revert back to the old days of watching circles run around the pitch. the stats for your manager at the beginning mean nothing as i won promotion with sheffield wednesday and the following season i was outside the relegation zone and looking like staying up (my objective was to fight against relegation) and they still sack me. additional to this i was making the team money. this has happened to me twice with two seperate teams. the stats i choose at the beginning were for a top manager and there is no way a team in that situation in real life would sack a top manager in that position. the top clubs sign all the best players but these players would not be happy to be sat on the bench and not playing games at all, just not realistic). and the amount of injuries i am faced against, at one point i had 8 of my first team players out for 2 months or more. like i said i do like the game though and will continue to play the gaem. i just hope our comments are heard and the game next year is better than ever and back to its origins at the top of the pile for its genre.",163.8

"officially 100 hours of this game now. i havnt even played as much as i wanted to but 100 hours is still a remarkable achievement. there are some people with more than a 1000 hours i know, its crazy. bust that just sums up how addictive this game is. if you are new to fm it takes a while to get used to the game, everything looks so complicated and time consuming. fm is very time consuming, but thats what makes it so good, you can literally sit there for hours and not even realise its been 10 hours and you havnt eaten. it took me a while to finish my first season with arsenal (my supported club) because i was still learning fm. i was new to it this xmas, not the series its self as i used to play the handheld version up to 2012 then i just stuck to fifa, but after looking at it for pc i thought i would try it out, like i said before though, the first season is the longest, you know, your learning the game and its mechanics, but after that you blast through it, in 100 hours i managed to complete 6 seasons, 100 hours seems like alot for 6 hours, maybe it is, but its a very rewarding game. the game is semi realistic i would say, more realistic than games like fifa but these are completely different games. some transfers can be stupid and the agent fees you have to pay are obscene. but this does not take the fun away however does make it frustrating when you realise rues has a release claus of 20 million but his agent fees are like 10 mil, which does come out of your transfer budget by the way. the tactic creator is spot on, the ability to chnage player roles, pick if they will attack, support or defend and setup individual and team instructions to make sure your players are palying how you want them. with fm i never fully got into training and he good thing is, you can make your assistant take charge of all training and match preperation so you can focus on the more important aspects like transfers and winnig games, if you wish. the match engine is suprisingly better than it looks, i really enjoy it, it gives you the ability to watch the games in 2d if you prefer or dont have the computer to run 3d. but thats no dissapointment, the 2d gives the game some nostalgia of championship manager with the dots moving around the field back in the day, good times. i wish they would add some way to upgrade stadiums and i wish they would have the proper premier league licenses, besides this the game is excellent, i give it a solid... 10/10.",100.4

"game is different than other incarnations in the fact that the ball in the engine is quite bouncy, until it hits the turf. you cant play one formation/tactic as the game goes on in the full mode, or you probably will lose as the ai makes adjustments. im currently in the middle of a hyde coaching run, really enjoying the low level start and the ability to go to caoching courses. overall, if you want a full in-depth rpg of a management game with the newest players? this is worth it. if you want a game that is already modded, polished, and fully tweaked, fm14 might be a better value. i bought it, ill play somewhere near 600 hours again this year, so i cant help but recommend it, if you enjoy strategy/management/man management games. no other game has had me fist pump as hard as when the regen scouted cb gustavo ellacopolous scored the winner for tottenham in the champions league final. the game is as good as the effort you put in, especially at a lower league team.",171.4
"this game will make that you will not have life...",312.6
"i just bought this game, and it does not work, on my mac, the game looks really old, the screen is black everywhere, every second line, has this black shadow, and when i touch it, it shows. when i remove the mouse, it gets all black again.. anyone, knows how to fix that???",5.9
"if you have played the others your soon know how addictive these games become, in terms of is it better than 2014? well at first its not simply because of getting used to the new layout but once you master this then yes all the way. better player interaction and match engine, and simply more behind the scenes as well to tweak. the staff on this game have been improved and how you utilise them, while still providing a challenging experience. 10/10",221.7
"game is great.injuries bit over the top.lovin game engine.massive step up",549.8
"the beta version for this game isnt impressive; too many basic and fudemental errors, e.g. cant right click players into positions (have to drag them and it takes ages) and you cant do set piece instructions as the button does completely nothing :( but the game play is far better this year, with similar graphics to fifa.",1000.1

"i only played a little. seems fun though.",1015.2
"great game the game is more like real and finally get better graphics. but there is some goalkeeper bugs need fix in beta and also the 1 on 1 is hard to score i only see my team score 1 1on1 at 1 season.",87.6
"i dont know why so many people have been complaining. it feels the same as last years game but with slightly better graphics and a more organized, nicer menu/interface. if you enjoy football, pick it up in the sale!",77.0
"regarding a lot of these negeative reviews, i honestly do not know what game people have been playing. the new side bar is a massive improvement to fms accessability. each core page is now much easier to access, freeing up space for a large search bar to instantly find any player, cup or competition in the games database. the new report page is excellent. it is now as clear as it can be what the pros and cons of each player are, making it even easier to scout the perfect player for your team in a given situation. as for the match engine, it keeps getting better and better each year and fm 2015 marks a big step forward with motion capture animations added to the mix. how anyone can play in 2d when the engine quality has improved so dramatically since its implementation is beyond me. fm 2015 is the biggest leap forward in the series for the past 2-3 years.",244.9
"so far i loved the game, really good and fair enough to play it this year. graphics really good, teams nice, players awesome and perfect training system in my opinion! just the best fm till now! awesome guys, really deserved the 50. my review is 9/10.",102.8
"this game is very good, its much better than the previous years, it seems a lot more technical, and your decisions as a manager, have more effect on your team and the game in general, i love the idea of being able to edit your manager stats, attacking, defence ect, its really good and its nice to be able to view them and use them in training, if anyone needs a question answered, id be happy to help :) overall, ill give the game 9/10 - reason being, is that its only the beta version, but i cant see there being much changed for the full version in a few days time (7th november) thank you for yet another, great game!",210.4
"only complaint for fm15 is ridiculous prices for players tried to buy shaquri from bayer and they wanted 67 million no way is he worth that 15-20 max ,then tried to buy kovacic from inter and they wanted 51 and lucas leiva this is ruining the game with stupid prices hope they can sort this out",241.5
"liking it, changes to the game are subtle and things i cant be bothered with like press and training are far too repetitive but in saying that it has it good points, the over feel of the game is good, with the new ui they have made a lot of improvments. a word to the developers, think big, rather than loads of small improvments you guys need to go for a big leap, try and give us regular customers something to get excited about, stadium design or being able to create a club from scratch in the lower leagues of a country and make it a real force over 10 seasons+. but all in all, if your a fan of the series then youll be happy with this...",260.8
"absolutely awesome! the new features are fantastic! gets me continue playing and playing! addictive again! well done si! if possible, they should add voice commentary in and that will be definitely awesome!",779.2
"almost 30 hours into beta 15.0.2 the game is perfectly playable right now, but there are some issues with defending, which im sure will be patched before launch this friday. if in doubt then wait till the full release and reviews of the patched version before paying up.",128.3
"10/10 will ruin life",209.6
"love this game, not much difference from last year, and my cons are that im liverpool ,beat bayern munich 4-1 had like 20+ shots , beat chelsea 2-1 had 15+ shots played crystal palce my striker missed two sitters -this stiker has finshing of like 19, losted 3-1 there striker score hatrick with finshing of like 13 makes sence, i had 25+ shots they had 5 , 4 on target",156.2
"i have loved this game series for years, and preordered the new one, and even though i would reccomend it, it is slightly bizarre... loads of goals, loads of injuries, loads of yellow/red cards, and sometimes you go on losing streaks that are unrealistic and absolutely impossible to get out of. i finally managed to get ahead in a game and one of my players was sent off so i lost. it sort of seems like they want to make it as difficult as possible. they just need to tone it all down a little bit, and it should be fine. i mean, one player i was against scored 4 in the first half. i mean liverpol are bad the moment, but i think it is slightly unrealistic for abel hernandez to get 4 against me in the capital one cup in less tha 45 minutes. never mind, i can focus on the league. oh wait, it is impossible to win in it. im sure it will improve once the beta period is over.",188.4
"based on beta - played all games since day 1 and most have had there issues but then its very hard to wipe out all problems with such a variation of methods. nothing i would class as gaming breaking occured and any issues with 3d engine can generally be ignored or altered tactics wise to suit. easily the best and most comprehensive version thus far, much improvement to gui, scouting etc and requires more patience when lower league. think all the changes are for the better and enjoying new challenge of working out all the new nuances and mechanics.",606.5
"i will recommend that you buy this game, dont listen to all this negative recommendations",604.6
"the beautiful game just ot a make over. after playing the series for a number of years now, i was expecting the same thing. yet it seems so much improved on things i didnt even know needed improving. 1 example is the competitions menu. it shows where you are in the league and cups. the staff are more helpful and i like the introduction to tunnel interviews. the 3d graphics now involve motion capture in them and look much improved. 1 thing that is really noticeable is tweaking a system. example, my false 9 striker was not getting any goals but i was winning games. i change him to poacher and he gets bucket loads. if you love football and you love the idea of managing your fave team, get this, its a no brainer.",189.5
"pros -new ui (while it may take some getting used to its superior to the old one) -scourting (much better and more realistic than the old system also great new scouting reports) -stadium view with banners -chatting with players board journalists etc improved -new tactics creator much better both vissually and technically cons -need some patching -goalkeepers seems to be completely useless (even the top ones) plus their reactions in 3d game engines reminds me of kidengarden kids tring to goalkeep (they make me wanna go to 2d games again). -the new generic logos for the non lincenced leagues are bad (guess well have to wait for workshop to fix)",45.4
"so far so good. lots of new features to play with. couple of downsides so far though; new layout seems more cluttered than before. stock skin is horrible on the eyes, hoping someone makes a nice clean skin like fm2014 was. easy on the eyes. playing as a club with red as a primary colour if very difficlut to do. as are some of the other colours. not so bad with white.",100.3
"well in my opinion this is by far the best football manager to date. the graphics on the 3d match are really good the gameplay seems alot smoother goalkeepers actually make really good saves. ive seen alot of people moaning about the beta version what you all need to understand is the whole point of this is so any problems that do occor you let them no they fix it and to be fair there are a few faults. 1. theres way to many injuries within pre season. 2. theres been to many times when the ball is in the box and the strikers or defence dont really do anything about it too many realistic goalscoring chances missed. 3. ridiculous transfer fees i no in fm14 it was the same but it seems unless you have 40 million to spend on one half decent player then you aint getting a half decent player. theres a few more things but i reckon the developers will fix all this before the game is actually released so im not worried. its well worth the money and if your a die hard football manager player then once this little things are fixed youll love it.",272.3
"i love the series, but this one is a mess so far. there are some good new features in the game, like the new scouting system - makes the game experience even more realistic. i played with carlisle utd - a low profile team in england second devision which relegated from 1st devision last season. the initial goal was promotion - the board set a budget of 0 transfer funds and 4-5k wages for additional players. i believe this goal is almost impossible to achieve even for the most hardcore players. i loaned 8 players for free from teams in the premier league and signed few free agents but even with them my team couldnt match most teams in 2nd dev. i am still recommanding the game because i believe si will fix all issues.",441.6
"another great iteration on the football manager franchise. some upgrades and tweaks throughout, although the ui is a little harder to navigate this time around. matchday engine is upgraded and press conferences feel much more natural.",147.5
"good game - honestly, i still prefer the layout/interface from 2014, but i probs just need to get used to it. crashed on me twice over 3 hours (mac) which is extremely annoying as i have to replay games (won 3 the first time, it crashed, played the games again and drew 2, lost 1). as a result my macbook nearly went out the window. get it sorted!!! also faaaaaar too many injuries - most of them being 3weeks+ 4 games into the season and half my team were injured. although this is only the beta, there are loads of changes that have to be made and hopefully they are fixed when the full game is released. if it stays the same way, chances are i wont have a laptop to play it on for very long.",93.9
"the game is just awesome! really good job from sport interactive! i suggest it 100% careful with crash! i had crash but sega helped me ;) buy this  <3",109.9
"although the most challenging of the series so far, more because of the new adaption to the layout and the scouting methods. for me its a big improvement on user interface but the harsh amount of injuries it makes progression a longer task where you have to put mild detail into the smaller things instead of throwing it to your below par am. i suggest it if you put a good amount of time into the later games but for a newbie 13/14 would be a safer choice in the way of enjoyment of the game and winning things.",63.0
"great game, play the demo and judge for youself. ive only played fm 14 and this and i am enjoying it greatly so far. ignore the negative reviews and judge for youselves, its a shame the majority of the fm community are moaning .",129.7

"i feel fm 15 to be exceptional i believe the match engine to be very modern and that the new user interface is revolutionary.i played the beta which i found brilliant,but there were some probs but im glad to say they have been fixed for the full game. i was falling away from fm for a bit dispite play each of the last 5 but fm15 has brought me right back to why i fell in love with football manager",428.2
"very much similar to previous iterations...but thats exactly what we are looking for!",1133.2
"i feel this is the best football manager out of all the old ones. it is much more fun, with plenty of things to do to improve your team and many difficult decisions you have to make to become successful. therefore i recommend all of you to buy it if you are interested in football. but the negative side of this game is that it does not have enough online players willing to play online, it is more fun if you play it with friends! on a side note if you want to join me in football manager you can add me, im almost always on steam.",294.8

"having played many of the footall manager games in the past, i admit i became bored of the same layout, things to do etc.... fm15 is really enjoyable and has re-ignited my love for this genre. i love the way it is no too deep, that it bores the pants of you, but also love it, because it has everything that you need from a fm game. the choices you make both to the media, players alike all have repecussions, and i have to say it is quite realistic with the in match options too. hats off for fm15 for a good game. only cons i have is the lack of premier league clubs badges and players faces etc, but i suppose that is to do with the licensing laws.......... would recommend.......now for the league",10.7
"football manager   .    .     .   ,    ,   .  ,   ,   .       .           ,   . thanks, fm!",74.6
"absolutely amazing game for people that love the tactical side of football (soccer). my most played game by a longshot.",1066.1
"nice game, nice interface, pretty accurate database. i always thought that it was a scissors, paper, rock game and i should just fine the thing to win all games but its not. the thing you do on the bench really affects the players on the field. the 3d is indeed pretty bad but for me it doesnt matter because i use 2d. if i wanted a graphical football game i would have chosen fifa instead. the initial version was full of bugs but now, with the latest updates, it feels good.",212.7
"calling football manager the best management sim out there is always a redundant statement. true as it is, its peerless excellence has chased any significant rivals away. but the biggest task is tempting players away from their carefully built career in the previous game. sports interactive know that its games biggest competition remains itself and, as you may tell your team at halftime, they must guard against complacency. fm15s changes tend to contribute to gentle improvement rather than startling disruption, but should do enough to tempt you into starting that managerial journey all over again.",56.6

"look, no game can be perfect. yes there are some issues with the new interface and match engine, but for a simulator such as this, fm is frankly amazing. overall, i have to say that football manager 2015 is a massive improvement from its 2014 counterpart and would highly recommend it to all football fanatics. if you are a past fm player and have been dissapointed with past versions, i honestly beg you to revisit your perspective and try out fm15 (please..)! it is a big step up from 2014 and is worth the money. 9/10",105.6

"really enjoying the game right now, i like starting with a lower league team and rising them up to the top league. im currently playing as stoke after being offered a job there because i promoted york city to the championship! loads of possibilities, my only issue is that there should be some fmc features in the normal fm mode apart from that good game.",38.4

"another wonderful addition to the football manager franchise! im an avid fan of the game and truely love this version. dont be put off by all the negative comments, if you enjoyed playing any of the previous versions, buy this one and just quite simpily expect more details. brilliant purcahase, hours of fun/swearing at your players. may i also reccomend the dvd released along side this game, it was a fantastic insight, i wont spoil it for you though!",363.0
"very addicting game, love every minute of it. if you love football, you will love this game. although this years version takes some getting used to, i definitely rate it higher than fm14.",769.9
"10/10. this game has ruined more of my hours than anything else.. have been playing football manager games even before steam ! absolutely sucks you in. the best part is when the players you scouted and picked up in game for cheap become super stars in real life :)",167.8
"i like the new updates. nothing to complain about fm15. the work permit for the premier league is no longer an issue compared to fm14. i can now sign whoever i want and send them off to a feeder club or let them take up a roster space.",680.5

"still the best football simulator game.. after i missed the 2014 series, this 2015 series is a much improvement from 2013 series.. the most improved part is: (1) higher complexity in handling players contracts and negotiation with other clubs; as well as (2) the improved tactical variety (players role, etc). while this could be a little bit cumbersome for those who new to this series, i believe the built-in tutorial will be very useful.",99.9

"good game like all year :)",535.5
"i have played this for a whole now. last time i played fm was fm12. i really like the fact they have two different game modes + if you want to cheat, you dont have to add a third party application. in this time with viruses etc its a great thing to have a thing available that the public wants. it should be free and not a payed add on. if you like fm i can warmly recommend this game. it tuns smoothly, i think its easier to play than earlier verions, the ingame graphics are much better, even on the laptop im playing with.",27.2

"first football manager that i have ever played, so i cant really tell if previous games were much better/worse. i havent had any bad experiences with the game. the game runs smooth, no crashes or other error-related situations. also, the diversity and possibilities within the game are good, in my opinion. i am playing an online mode with a friend of mine, which makes the game even more fun. never thought i could be so addicted to this game, but wow...its pretty addictive if i say so.",213.9
"yeah its good, buy it.",253.6
"i cant enable in game community to access the in game editor. can someone help?",152.2
"core experience remains the same but an upgraded match engine and a few new features make this a worthwhile addition. much like its predecessor, fm2015 is an evolution of the series rather than a revolution. this is both a bad and a good thing. the main differences between 2014 are mainly numerous small things that i will not mention here. i will mention the two things that stand out to me however. 1.) match engine: this has been in my opinion, greatly improved. matches seem to flow better, there are far more moves, goals scored seem mutch more varied and over all it makes it harder to predict the outcome of a move (something i found i could do with previous match engines due to having seen the same move over and over again). overall i think this is the best 3d match engine they have released. 2.) layout: for some reason they have decided to completly change the layout and all the menus etc. this is still p*ssing me off as the changes seem illogical and now takes me much longer to go to screens than before. i can see no reason for the change apart from for changes sake. it doesnt make things easier or quicker or more intuitive and generally just slows things down as it can take awhile to dig into sub menu after sub menu to look for the page you want. for existing fm2014 fans this may not have enough of a change to warrant a full price purchase but for players of older versions or new players i think the updated match engine do warrant the game for consideration. overall i do recommend the game as overall i find the fm series to be excellent, however note there are not a massive amount of changes compared to the last release.",119.7
"with last update, i am beging to love the game, with proper graphics it almost like fifa 13 graphics in terms of game play, but still need improvement. the best aspect of this is the scounting aspect, you need to get this games in order to experience what i am talking about.",1863.5
"ive been playing this game for 5 years and ill always say - yes to football manager and no to other soccer management simulation games. this game have the largest player and stuffs database, salaries and characteristics are close to real and the diversity of tactical changes makes us to think in a new way. with each new step developers doing football manager more interesting and better. the only disadvantage was and still is the graphics of 3d matches, but its not the games main component. there is no limit to perfection as they say. my mark is 9 out of 10.",133.2

"my game keeps playing up, giving the whole game different names, every other day it does this. not impressed.",60.0

"a lot of people over the years have hated certain new installments of football manager. however, for an addict who has been playing since the first cm came out everything is as beautiful as it should be every year - unless you play with the 3d graphics on, which is absolutely horrid but then again you can never go wrong with 2d. of course, there are some bugs during matches and some inequities but when youre a manager you know that life aint fair. keep on managing till you cry blood when you score with your underdog team against one of the big guys of football and have that mental  when your months of tactical work pays in the end. the best  that has been changed are the ui, scouting and the tactics panel. i absolutely love the new circular star things over the players in the tactics screen. im an fm addict so whatever you give me i will play but those of you who feel the same about it will surely love and play this game anyway. we need that fix yo.",419.7
"brilliant game. yes injuries are mainly constant but players normally only out for around a week tops(people make it sound like months.) new patch also has resolved concerns on the bad situation invlolve the defence/goalkeeper. highly recommend!",67.3
"really enjoying this game, although there was lots of injuries when i first started. i feel like the game is a harder and focuses more on man management, for example if your player is unhappy about their contract or the amount of games hes played then he can disrupt the squad unless you sort the problem out. overall im enjoying the game my highlight so far has been managing man utd and being 3-0 down at half time against newcastle at st jamess park before switching to an attacking tactic i created and bringing on james wilson who scored a hattrick in an incredible 4-3 comeback that included two stoppage time goals.",1518.8
"review after update 15.03 the game goes much nicer then the first one after this update, match engine improvement, many bugs been solved though some not fixed yet, but its expected since its still on beta. cant wait the full release on november 7, i hope by that time most of the remaining bugs or maybe all the bugs are fixed. i love the side bar panel on this year version, sure need time to get used to it but for me its more simple and nice to see, they put much more detail on feature on this year version too like team talk etc. many improvement from last year version that i cant write it all but for me its worth to buy it though its still on beta and even more worth to buy after the 15.03 update. almost 100 hours playtime on two weeks for me that mean this is a game that worth to be in your library if you like to become a football manager.",394.5
"this game is a must have. i hate soccer in real life, its so boring to watch and i think its one of the worst sports. however this game is amazing that it makes me like soccer and makes me want to get into it. the realistism of this game from simple stuff like player moral to the more complicated things. if only ea sports could do as good of a job as this company does...

"i was really looking forward to playing football manager 2015 on pc, as ive always experienced only hanheld version. the difference in accuracy and particulars between the two is immediatly noticeable. there are two main modalities: a simplified one (closer to handheld versions) and a full-simulation one (suggested to expert fm gamers). according to me the game in both modalitites is quite difficult, furthermore im really concerned with the fact that i cant find a suitable tactic for my team. managers functions are completely outstanding, as the give you a wide range of possibilities, and in genereal they seem to be close to reality. in general the game is really entartaining and amazing, with nice 3d graphis, that enhance the whole simulation effect. in general the game is very nice.",90.3

"the sidebar is welcome. generally the screen layouts have been much improved. however the match engine feels like a bit of a backward step, although i understand that its early days for the motion-capture route their taking. the one thing that drives me mad the most is the sound of ball being kicked; a noise happens every time a player kicks the ball, even if its a mere tap a foot a head of them. this is most fustrating during intra-squad friendlies when there is no crowd noise to ease the pain.",119.5

"while presenting an extremely innovative and immersive experience of the football management appeal, it leaves gamers who are unfamiliar or rookie to the sport in the dark. though the game is of high appeal to those who are well versed in the world of english football, one could easily advise those who are unfamiliar to steer away; this game is not for novices. this isnt to say that this lack of equality is a detraction from the game itself - quite the opposite - for those seasoned in english football, the game provides a beautiful experience for the hotseat of game management and requires extremely detailed choices for all aspects of the job in order to ensure success both on the field and off.",11.2
"this game is highly reccommended by me. 100% buy. the game has had a huge improvement from 2014 and the game has come a long way since it first started. 1 huge feature that they have improved is the way your team listen your advice and it can actually make a difference in your. new features making it a more realistic manager simulator. the wide range of players and team availabe and giving you a chance to choose how much of an experienced manager you are. this is a must buy to big football manager fans and dont be dragged into it being a copy of last years version. to me it is a huge improvement from 2014. must buy!",86.5

"i rate 8/8. but seriously though this is a great game. for the past two years ive spent way too many hours on football manager games and i reckon this wont be any different. yeah there are some problems, yeah it could be better in some ways. but hey, its a brilliant game other than these miniscual problems. i fully recommened it to anyone intrested in football as its a game with so much depth you wouldnt beleive. pros + detail/depth (the database is used by real clubs its accurate!) addictive (you just dont get bored) challenging (its much more challenging than in recent years) interactions (its nice to see much more options in interviews) 3d match engine (yeah its got its problems, explained below, but its still good) new ui design (the new user interface is so much easier to navigate, give it a couple of hours and youll never want o go back) cons - 3d match engine (the only reason its a problem is if your tactics arent good enough it makes the players make stupid mistakes and can be quite unrealisitic and frustrating. but if it was 2d it wouldnt be as bad just because you cant see the mistakes as much. just get your tactics right. match engine (so hard to defend, so easy to score. expect lots of high scoring games for no reason) crashes (this has happened 3/4 times since i got it on the 29/10 happens at any time, hope it gets sorted soon. just set it to save every fortnight and youll be fine) so overall another great game which i much prefer over the recent games and fully recommend.",184.8

"same game as the last couple of years. its a little better with the newest patch but a lot of things still dont matter. - the teamspeeches dont seem to do anything or you get negative results from it even though the game says you should say that to them. - clubs controlled by the game buy up all of the best players and then dont even let them play, making it very diffecult for you to create a team that can win big prices. the players how go to those clubs and the after a year are put on the transferlist dont want to move to your club because they are playing at a better club even though they didnt play a single match. - scouting uses a system where you can see what percentage your knowledge of a player (0-100%) is but there is no option in the scoutingmenu to say scout to a 100%. and even then at 100% sometimes the players potential still isnt completly scouted. - when asking the board to raise the salarycap for staff members it gets raised by 200 euros which isnt nearly enough to get any improvements. - whenever one of your players get injured during a match its never the games fault. it never gives itself a red or even a yellow card. but you get red cards constantly. - still cant reload my save during matches. its an offline single-player game. if i want to reload my save during a match who cares. these are the main problems. and yet its still very addictive, the best football management game out there and i cant stop playing.",499.1

"ive bought every football manager game after the big split and a fair few champ man ones before that. have to say im slightly disappointed by this years offering. very little of interest has been added. sure more conversations to be had but the quickly boil down to the same six or seven answers yourre always giving. the management style is fun but quickly seems pointless and gaining the licenses if little more that a tick box exercise. the engine does look better and although far from perfect the board interaction is more detailed but with the bugs still there. what has to be the most annoying part for me though is the amount of time the game wants you to do basic hr work. from the exciting world or contact negotiations to micro managing every action your apparently half witted staff carry out is long winded. its made even more annoying by the fact your backroom staff rarely follow you and often the first few weeks at a new club (admittedly usually lower league for me) is spent waiting to get a assistant manager before being able to do anything at your new club. all in all its more of the same and the updates are enough to keep me interested.i hope that more effort is but into making the game more fun for those of us who like played 10/20 seasons into the future. more interesting press conferences with much more answer variety and maybe the ability to negotiate not just a move for you but your whole backroom staff. its a begrudging yes vote from me but hopefully with improvements in the future.",944.6
"i like the new skin, generally a small step forward",135.1
"before i start praising this game, a couple of points. 1. i currently have zero senior squad injuries (and about 5 in my entire 77 man senior and non-senior squad) 2. i started the game with quite a few high scoring games; but have now reduced this to a series of 2-1s. i cant keep a clean sheet to save my life but im not set up to do so. i dont know if that counteracts some of the other comments. i would also say that the injuries/ big scores seem to be more probable at the start of the season. not sure if its related to you being a new manager and your players just coming back from holiday if you are considering playing the franchise for the first time then ask yourself two questions: 1. do you accept this is a management sim rather than a strategy game? 2. do you have plenty of hours to spend making a sucession of decisions that you dont really know are having an affect. if you answer yes to both of the above and have a love of football, then welcome to your second (and unpaid) career!! fm2015 is put, quite simply, the most complete management sim around, and gives the best opportunity to prove that you really know what youre talking about down the pub and how much better you are than your local teams manager. what really sets this game apart is the intransigence of the match engine - you never really know whether your tactics are going to work, making each and every game unpredictable and exciting. what matters in this game is not what you do in each individual match (ignore the fans, theyre dumb) but how you fare over a whole season. the random variation in the match engine is quite large, but over time it minimises itself. if you can handle losing games you should have won in return for knowing it wont shaft your overall position, then you and fm2015 should get along just fine. where it tends to go wrong is if you just cant accept defeat (or a player injury, it would seem). the game is not perfect. for every great thing, there is a little le. for instance, the match highlights can make your team look fluid and genuinely exciting; but then at times your players can just stand their with the ball as the match engines is obviously deciding what to do next. and how many times do i need to see my free kicks sail over the bar? the user interface is much better than fm2014, but the filters dont always work as you would like them to. the scouting system is intuitive and attractive, but your scouts sometimes say things that arent true. all this les are relatively minor and dont impact on how well you do, but you do sometimes wish that si would game test a bit more. but overall, and this is the most important thing, i love the game. im not sure exactly when this turned from a game into a sim; but this year you will have to deal with financial fair play as well as transfer windows (if there were two things designed to annoy fm players...) if you think ffp is all part of the fun then go out, buy the game, take time with the closed season, dont expect too much in the first dozen games and just enjoy the superiority complex you get from successfully managing a fake team in a computer game. ps. its one of those games where the more you know about it, the more fun youll get. there is tons of stuff out there explaining the tactical side of the game. i would recommend taking the time to read some of it.",68.7
"graphics and interface are great, the challenges and the new features are nice too, but the match engine is still awful. please sports interactive fix that match engine with dumb and bizarre plays. i play fm since the first ones and the match engine and a.i. always sucked, it seems that the newer versions keep the same horrible match engine. anyway, i still recommend the game if you are a football addict.",99.5

"bought this game after the december update and regarding the problems many other customers have complained about below i have to say after four full months of the first season i havnt had any problems with crazy amounts of injuries and the match engine is not producing crazy results. its not a perfect game, i think if the developers spent more time and effort on it then the game could be what it should be in the year 2015 after the 23 years of product development time theyve had since i first played cm on my amiga 500 back in the day, not to get to long winded - in my opinion its the best version ive played yet but it should have been this good in 2001. pros - steam workshop, fast gaming experience relative to previous versions, lots of options, not neccessarily overly complicated, match engine is capable of the beautiful game at times and does manage to elicit strong emotions in me, did i mention steam workshop? cons - gks sometimes go mindless for a few seconds in match engine leading to fantasy breaking silly goals this happens maybe once every three games, -having to always watch the kick offs and final whistle highlights in match engine even if nothing interesting happens, -about once a game in the match engine a pointless highlight will show and last too long even though nothing interesting is happening.",41.5

"ooohh, guys! i havent seen enough of 3d match and playing to criticize injuries but tactical window is really awfull. i am playing fm for three years and learned a lot of hints that use but i cannot cast overall team picture, first of all it regarding player roles. team in tactics window looks like a heap of scrap, i failed to set up player roles through it. new image of correspondece skills and position needs to measure with a scale, it very uninformative. second, tactics windows on a match. on my 15 display i see only part of player skills when try to find him optimal role. its very very uncomfortably. dear developers, please fix it on the next patch but early will be better. reccomendation is advance. curse of fm that before third path - game is really different to play. good luck, we trust in you!",543.3

"first off, i want to say that i was in two minds about getting this game. reviews from the fans didnt seem very positive and as this game has a great community and fan following i was quite shocked. the main criticism has been the frequency of injuries. from what i have seen this is not even true! if anything ive seen fewer injuries than in previous versions. i have been looking closely to see this so called injury problem yet ive never seen more than two key players being injuried at one time and not even for very long! its overall a great and addicting game and my favourite yet if im honest. however, the match engine, although improved, is quite poor and freak goalkeeper mistakes dont seem all that freak anymore as they occur quite a few times each season. however im pretty sure the match engine isnt much to go by (the commentary sometimes says completely different things to what the match engine shows - e.g player shoots really wide but the commenary claims it was almost in) this isnt much of a problem in all honesty and if you had commentary on only you wouldnt ever notice. the new menu layout is really good in my opinion and finding what i want to do is now much easier and quicker making me actually pay more attention to tactics, training and scouting (which i have often ignored to a large extent in previous games) overall id say this game is great and the series is still going strong. so glad i got this game, i would advise you buy it too!",38.6

"its one of the best football games hands down",9.8
"good game, but you cant really compare it to other football games like fifa and pes. this is a very tactical game, and you can easely get fired, but overall a very good football game, ratings: graphics - 6/10 - nice interface and layout, but when you play a match, it isnt as good to look at. gameplay - 8/10 - tactical and very good! mods - 8/10 - nice amount mods and tweaks to this game, and they are working absolutley fine. overall - 6.7/10 (let me know to other things to judge) (i know of the youtubers footymanagertv and statapp, comment more people!)",13.2
"overall, fm15 is a good game. different from fm14, providing different tactics and new ways of training. there are also some improvements regarding press conferences, they are shorter compared to fm14 and the question variety is greater. touchline team talks was also a good addition and the overall general layout is technically easier than fm14. saying that though, if you are an experienced fm player be prepared to take a while to get used some minor details, such as making a player avaliable to the under 21 squad is under the development tab instead of a squad tab. the 3d match engine is slightly better, however sometimes the goalkeepers do not behave like real goalkeepers in the 3d match engine. not diving, sometimes the keeper slides across on his two feet to save a shot instead of diving, other than that it is an improvement. however, the game by default does not have badges or logos or many player faces, you have to download that yourself. the tactics are technically more straight foward, if your new to fm you may find them easier compare to previous fms. however, if you are experienced it will take a while getting used to the changes. to conclude, i would reccomend the game, however it is not a big improvement to 14 and it may perhaps be better to wait for 16 or wait for more updates, however if you do decide to buy it, it is still worth it.",181.5
"absolutely baffled by some of the negative comments about the game. ive not played fm since fm 12 so maybe the minor improvements over the years impress me more than most. i agree that the training is a liitle poor and needs work and i have only played 15 hours but overall ive found the game very good. its not outstanding like the earlier versions but it is always going to be difficult to develop it so far forward without ruining the gaming or changing it beyond recognition. so far i havent had any major issues with injuries and the match engine is fine with no silly mistakes and goals from all over the pitch. if youve not played fm for a while like myself then buy it but it appears if you have been buying it year in year out then maybe you need to take a break away from the keyboard, get some fresh air, a bit of sun and come back to it in a year or two. oh and some places sell the game for 20 which isnt a lot really.",222.9

"there really is no game on the market that puts you more into the situation of being someone you are not, of giving you the role of a manager, of involving you in the day to day trials and minutia of that job. and, aside from that, this years version (though weirdly under publicised for some reason) is a comparatively huge leap forward for the franchise and i would reccommend it to anyone - even if you have zero interest in football. hell im not even a fan of football myself - its just that the tactical depth of this game is unsurpassed by anything else out there. most importantly for fans of the series the overhaul on the match engine this time has really made games a joy to watch, touchline instructions following advice from your assistant are vastly more intuitive, the tactics editor is finally streamlined and comprehensive, and the old tool-tips system has been replaced by a novel and extremely usefull ? help system. it isnt without small faults. the random training injuries this year can seem extreme. your best player can be out for a season for being injured whilst picking his nose. i know footballers are pansies but come on! experienced players will find that it takes some adjusting to familiarise yourself with where everything is despite all the help and information now made available. some of the player interactions, whilst they certainly make things more interesting, just arent that likely - getting totally raged on by one of your players simply because he does not play in every single game can snowball into him deliberately infecting the rest of the team and the board sacking you and, again, i find this a little extreme. also, the new ability to use social media doesnt work quite the way it should and is heavilly biased toward google. despite its many tiny flaws this years version is far better than any that have gone before. the negative reviews from long term fans are, in my opinion, written by people who do not like change. regardless of what you think about the series this is the best fm game there is. 90%",186.3

"reading all the negative reviews of the game i thought id come and give my two cents. ive played fm since the 2005 edition and fm15 is my favourite iteration yet. the game makes you feel, now more than ever, like youre in charge of a football team that is composed of individuals, not spreadsheets. here are the pros and cons ive found so far: =======pros=========== -player management has been revamped this year and players behave more realistically than ever. you cannot sign a player on a key player wage, not play him and expect him to be satisfied if you drop him for no reason. additionally, other players in the squad may side with him and make your position untenable (resulting in you getting sacked for losing the dressing room), or on the contrary, complain about you treating him too kindly if you give in to his demands. players going to the press will also get picked up a lot more and you will be facing insistent and often annoying questions on how youre handling the player in question. this leads me to the next pro: -improvements to media handling. anyone who complains about the increase in media occasions from fm14 must not know that you can give over control of media handling to your assistant. handling the media is a key part of any managerial job and i appreciate the fact that si have tried to make it feel as real as ever. having a pesky journo run after me in the tunnel after a  performance, i found myself snapping at him, which shows how effective adding these (rather small) features has been at enhancing the experience of managing a football club. -the match engine is a lot prettier than earlier versions. -the interface, while it takes some getting used to, is great and feels a lot crispier than earlier versions. small decisions like splitting staff and player searches into the staff and scouting categories make the game easier to navigate. -scouting has been vastly improved and it is now easier than ever to make the scouts suit your needs rather than them giving you reports you dont want to see. the option to have them scout leagues for specific player types, such as a replacement for an ageing first team player or a promising youngster, also add to the organic feel of the game. ============cons=============== -although the match engine has been tweaked since the release, it still needs a bit of work. crossing and long shots by players who, given their attributes, really have no business hitting 30 yard screamers 5 times a season still exist although theyre being worked on. -injuries seem to happen in waves, where youll spend 6 months injury free and then have 5 players get long term injuries in the same week. its frustrating, but again, the last patch did introduce changes to injury probabilities... it just needs to be tweaked a bit. -although i enjoy the new interface, the tactics screen absolutely sucks and needs to be changed in future patches. the star for the players comfort in that position and circle around it to indicate suitability compared to the rest of the squad in particular is hideous. if its that difficult to describe in writing, then it shouldnt be a feature. those are the major gripes i have on the game. the losing against promoted teams when youre on a 5 game win streak may be frustrating, but if you look at real life football thats often what happens, teams who perform well against strong opposition may get complacent and slip up against minnows. the fact of the matter is that if you love football, no game out there will allow you to experience the beautiful game quite like fm15 does. the changes arent perfect but theyre there, and si has patched issues that the playerbase found with the game, and say what you will about them, theyre passionate about football and really care about their game. which game dew do you know who would go and get written permission from a 15 year old wonderkids parents just so they could put him in the game and let players see how he turns out? the game is far from perfect but ive put dozens of hours into it so far and have enjoyed every second of it. i cant review fm classic as i dont touch it, but the fully simulated experience is as close to managing a football club as youll ever get without going into the profession yourself. 9/10.",72.8

"ive only put in about 20 hours (not much considering its the fm series) in the beta so far, but i just feel that i have to counter these complaints about the game engine being worse. for the first time since fm09, i feel that the game engine has improved from last year. im not experiencing these random results at all, and the goals that are scored are can almost everytime be traced to a tactical flaw or strength, as opposed to fm14 where that percentage wouldve been about 50. im not experiencing this whole thing with vast amounts of goals being scored/conceded either, nor the comeback issue people have been reporting. i feel like these issues sound like typical beta issues (remember, it is a beta youve been playing) that will be resolved quickly, but will see. either way, im good. corners have been improved, where tactics and player attributes actually make a difference for once, and it is now finally possible to score on free kicks and longshots again (it was of course possible before - but not even the best players in the world would even be close to a realistically decent conversion rate).",25.5
"i have to disagree with the majority of reviews. i have played the franchise for years also and i am loving this edition. may be it is because i have just brought it and it has been updated but everything including the match engine have been drastically improved. the injurys are nothing out of the ordanary and i am playing with arsenal. goals per game are very realistic, and i have had only 2 big wins out of 10 games yet i have lost only 1 friendly and the charity sheild against city which ended 2-0. what ever the other reviews said negitivly about this game i have seen none of so far, and to think i almost took note of what people where saying and almost never brought it and i am so glad i did. cdkeys sold it for 20.91 and it was well worth it already. didnt think i liked the dark skin and i was disappointed that it was the only one but after trying a few of the custom light skins i soon went back and love the original dark skin now. my one critic so far is the pitchs look slighly blocky and not smooth enough.",394.6

"the graphics is great, it more realistic than fm 2014, the engine is great, a lot of cool stuff and great look. but it still like older fm and not quite change a lot. there are still bugs, the most thing that make me hated is the shots. in a match my team scored 18 but 9 on target and 3 goals when they shot 10, 6 on target and 5 goal. and the second thing is injury why is injury happened a lot and crazy like 6-7 months, 3-5 months, 6-7 weeks. but this game is still cool, i really like this game. if you like football and like manage football club, i recommend you to play this!!! for me this game is 7.5/10",45.3
"this game is amazing, and i know for a fact i am never going to play any other game for a long long time. ui: the new ui is great, even though it comes down to personal preference. many people dont like the new sidebar, but i persoanlly think its pretty good. the whole ui is also a lot cleaner. ai: the ai is pretty realistic, even though clubs sometimes make unrealistic demands of players, while they could just say that they arent interested in selling the player. other then that, i dont really have any problems with this. also, some people dont like the scouting of players, but this is just meant to be realistic. you are always free to play football manager classic, which doesnt include a lot of the time consuming features, such as team talks and continuous scouting. match engine: when people say the match engine is horrible, they do have a point. horrible, horrible goalkeepers, defenders not knowing how to defend, strikers dribbling right through defenders, and these are only a few of the bad stuff. this normally wouldnt be a problem, but the match result is determined by the match engine as the game continues, so goalkeepers make stupid mistakes like not responding quick enough, and so you lose because of that. this, for me, is pretty much the only bad thing about fm15, even though this is like one of the most important parts. multiplayer: now, i dont think anyone else thinks this, but i think fms multiplayer is horrible. the season goes on without you when some people are on, and its just messed up and complicated. i havent played multiplayer much, but this is just my experience from multiplayer. conclusion: this is a great game, i dont know if people who are already fans of the series need to buy this one, but people just starting with the series should definitely get this. i really hope this helped!",305.4

"contrary to a lot of view i recommend fm15. although i am new to the game itself, i am an avid football fan. so here a quick whats good and whats bad in my opinion. please remember im new to fm and will say what i like from my point of view, regardless of whether it has been in the fm franchise in the past or if it was better on old versions. whats good; -modern menu system which is easy to navigate -lot of reposibilites which make gameplay feel realistic. -ability to assign assistant manager to roles like dealing with training etc. -in game graphics are exceptable (however dont accept fifa or pes standard) -games have felt realistic and in game tactics make a massive difference whats bad; - i really could not get to grips with the scouting system. on both of my two careers so far i have created a scouting assignment in which no players have been scouted or suggested to me. nothing at all! maybe im the one at fault but that is not my fault as the game didnt explain it properly to me. i have yet to make a single signing yet due to not being able to find an adequate player who meets my scout report. - i have started 2 careers and in both the same transfers were happening. southampton bought jo from cam and naughton from tottenham, and also sold clyne to spurs in both careers. as well as man u buying vertonghen and khedira going to chelsea. i found it annoying because i wanted to see a variation and to be interested in the other signings rather than seeing the same deals happen. -(this maybe like something i havent downloaded or something not sure tbh) i expected players to have faces and also the top division clubs from the bpl to have the official badges but they dont. overall i would recommend this game because of the potential of reach 3 digits of game time. i will always continue to play this game and am definitely happy to have bought it.",19.5
"ive played most the football managers over the years and to be fair, this is a big step up from fm14 which was awful, i have actually got into this fm and enjoyed every minute of it. i like the new press and scouting features and can see a difference with the game engine, even if its small. for everybody saying its awful, just remeber its still a new release, and comparing with last year its pretty descent. i havent had the trouble of to many goals from crosses. to me, this game is enjoyable and fun.",140.1
"so frustating. i dont know whats wrong. i feel like i lost my ability to play this game. i am noob all over again. (been playing since 2001). - my team keep shooting didnt score. the enemy 1 bullet to the heart! and of course i lost the game. - my wing back keep dribbling until byline wont cross, and if he do the crosses hit enemy foot and goes corner kick. frustating. - my goalie is dumb, enemies goalie is all neuer! unbeatable. i need. or we all need major fixes. please. :(",112.9

"update has been added below! ************************************************************************ november 24 2014: stay away from the game. many issues which were solved years ago have come back: - too many goals from corners - too many goals from crosses - way too many injuries. my last game: 1yellow/red card and 3 serious injuries. one ing game. - stupid mistakes from goalkeepers (yes, the passing issue is still there). - very bad user interface in the tactic area. it was much better in fm 2014 - same tranfer ai issues we saw within fm 2006 or 2007. ai is buying players for too much money. ai teams demand too much money for young talents: 30-40 mio+ - instant goals from the oppostions: dominate the game, score a goal and watch how yout opponent scores 20 seconds later. - leading 2 : 0 often leads to a sudden rush of the opponent which results in a 2 : 3 good things: new scouting area is an improvement. i like the bar on the left, but this has already been in the game years ago. it was removed, now it is back. i made this experiences with a team playing against relegation in the first geman league. maybe the fm feels better if you play with a team like barcelona. in total not worth the money for me. it feels like they published a reskinnend version of fm2006. better wait for some patches and watch the community. ******************************************************************************************************************** update: 02.12.2014: si has released 2 updates. from what i experience now the game has improved and im currently enjoying it. big improvement: - stupid mistakes from goalkeepers (yes, the passing issue is still there). have not seen this any more. big improvement - leading 2 : 0 often leads to a sudden rush of the opponent which results in a 2 : 3 the rush is still present but normally the ai will score ones and then youll be able to make it 3-1. or maybe 3-2. big improvement: - too many goals from crosses in my opinion the amount of goals after crosses has come to a normal level. but i have also worked on my tactic. improved: - too many goals from corners its has been improved, but i still seem to concede many goals after corners. this could also be an issue of my tactic. slightly improved: - very bad user interface in the tactic area. it was much better in fm 2014 player roles are back on the tactic screen, but still a bit complicated. no change: - way too many injuries. i still got many injuries. sometimes it is very annoying but the good thing is, that most of the injuries are not serious. it seems like there is a higher chance to get serious injuries during the season breaks. within the season, i am often faced with injuries during matches but so are normally only minor things. max 3-4 weeks. could be balanced a bit. no change: - same tranfer ai issues we saw within fm 2006 or 2007. ai is buying players for too much money. ai teams demand too much money for young talents: 30-40 mio+. ai is releasing too many players for free. this is my biggest complain with the game. the transfer-ai is still stupid. apart from the huge amount of money the top ai-teams are spending, you will also be able to find very good player for free. for example: bayern is releasing xherdan shaqiri for free. in real life they are demanding 25 million euro. this means that you will be able to upgrade your team from a mid class club to a european top-team wihtin a couple of seasons. way too easy! this was already an issue of previous fm games. conclusion: i have improved my tactic to handle the match engine issues. after the updates i was able to set my wing backs from defend to support duties, without getting rushed by the ai. good thing because you dont feel so helpless anymore and this gives you the opportunity to try more things. thank god that the issue with leads of 2 - 0 is gone. that was very annoying. overall i have started enjoying the fm. scouting is really fun now and makes more sence. the transfer ai should be improved with the next updates, same procedure as every year.....but im sure the issue with too many good free player will not be solved... also likey every other year in fm history. so i can now recommend the game.....but never preorder it ;-)",308.9
"player asked improved contract. agent doesnt let him enter talks with me. complains to lockeroom, everybody wants improved contract for him, makes everyone unhappy, next thing i know xlllx. 10/10",292.3
"update: too many dramas!!! like most player became upset, cause i sold one useless youth player 0_o more complain because someone lack of appearance even their status are not regular, then playing him as starter 3 matches straight, asking for leave, whining to team mates, my team morale down wtf if you like drama more than football, buy this game and also match engine still ridiculous, any opponent can score 2-3 on my team.",196.1
"only negative i can say is in my 3rd season with man utd i hit some sort of glitch that meant i couldnt win away from home! seriously, my home record was; played 19 won 18 drew 1... away record; played 19, won 3, drew, 6, lost 10. i had scores like loosing 2-1 to brentford (whom had been promoted) leading arsenal 4-1 with 10 mins to go, to drawing 4-4. beat city at old trafford 5-0 and lost at the etihad 5-3. the scores throughout that season just seemed very random, no matter what i did. other than that its very much same old fm (which there is nothing wrong with) already played 71 hours. trying to catch up on the 600+ hours i played of the last edition haha",194.1
"first match: ribery gets injured. the rest of the players are on vacation, so i cant play the next match because i only have 10 players. restart... first match: ribery gets injured. this game will improve, or people will not buy fm 16. update march 2015 a key first team player was sold without my approval before i played the first training match. update a key first team player was sent on  permanent holiday without my approval.",2.4
"i recommend this game.",126.1
"im having a love-hate relationship with this version of the game. theres some stuff to love, and a bit more to hate. but heres the main points: pros: +switching between two teams when managing a club and country is easier +considerably more realistic +sidebar, and game in general, is neat. everything is tidy, easy to look at, easy to find cons: -the team selection screen is so, so clunky -3d match engine is still awful. i still play on 2d because i cannot deal with the mistakes that will happen on 3d, like defenders passing in to their own net far more regularly than irl",168.2
"--- below is my original review, but i have changed it from recommended to not recommended, because even after patching, the game and match-engine is unrealistic; how could the programmers not realise this? i regret buying it and have gone back to fm14.--- this game is definitely not as bad as some of the reviews say, though it does have its problems. id definitely recommend this to fans of the series. lets go through the pros and cons: pros: - i like the new ui, i think its improved on previous titles, with things like scouting/transfers in more logical places - it runs smoother: you no longer have that weird 10 second pause when changing tactics in a match; instead it takes less than 2 seconds. this means you can make lots more changes in the match withou being annoyed by the pause every single time. - i havent seen the oft mentioned issues with getting lots of injuries; its stayed around the same as previous titles on that front for me. -player interaction and media interaction are considerably improved cons: - weirdly takes longer to save than fm14. over a minute and a half for me. - the games are too high scoring, and this needs to be patched for realism purposes. i just had 5 games that were 6-3, 6-3, 5-3, 0-0 (lol) and 6-3 again... a bit silly... - goalkeepers are pretty bad, hence the high scores. - it feels like its harder to play a possession game, but that might be just because im leicester. its a fun game; im definitely glad i bought it. good for fans of the series; if patched it could be brilliant. they say theyve solved the issue of too many fks going in, but they dont seem to have",88.9
"i do not like writing about the games i have not completed,but... its rather hard to complete any fm series game. i have already spent some time with the game and i can say, that fm 2015 is good as always - which means perfect. i had some problems to get used to a bit new look of the menus after spending hundreds of hours in the previous edition, but after 5 hours i realized, that it is now even more clear and comfortable. there is no need now to click through three windows to find interesting stats or anything else. the authors added even more tactical features, which make the impression, that you have even greater control of the way the team plays the matches. the graphic got better, though its the least important part and of course the data base is updated adding thousands of new players, managers and more.. its impossible to describe this game shortly and there is no sense in writing poems about it. if you have never played any football manager game and are at least a bit interested in football, then give it a try. and if you have played, then you probably do not any recommendation.",213.2
