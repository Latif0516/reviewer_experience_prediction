"game of the year simulator. if youre thinking about buying a game and you dont have gta5 you basically need this game. beware you need a pretty fast computer to keep up, the game is cheap in comparison to what you might need to spend to get it running but i can play it on a radeon hd 5870 1gb without much fuss so the fact that it can run on 2009 hardware is pretty impressive. no complaints in the optimization department. i must say, the pc options are fantastic. there is a lot of tweaking to do, especially in regards to the controller and keyboard settings in addition to the expansive performance tweaks. my favorite part is having a keyboard and mouse and gamepad in front of me and when the game gets to an intense shooting part i can put down my controller and use the keyboard/mouse and start shooting without having to go to a settings menu and change anything. it just works. its perfect. the gameplay itself needs no introduction. you can do pretty much anything. even online play is pretty good, first time i played two guys were in an airplane and nosedived right into me while on foot and everyone died. 10/10",27.8
"this review took me almost 2 years to write and was delayed 3 times.",56.0
"i walked 2 minutes in the rain.. and i actually get wet.. 10/10",59.7
"first thing i did was turned model detail all the way up and went to strip club 69/69",3.8
"ps3 & xbox360 thanks for alpha testing. xbox one & ps4 thanks for beta testing.",22.5
"rockstar told us the pc-version would be the ultimate version and they were right. i just love this game, the heists, the missions.. everything! 10/10 and its running smooth. :) pros: beautiful graphics and city 3 character switch smooth gameplay hours of fun gta online. cons: rockstar social club integration itself. taking a long time to load sometimes.",19.0
"well it is finally here and they were not lying when they said the were optimising it. they optimised it great! even if your pc meets minium requirements you can still run the game at 45-50 maybe 60 fps.",66.6
"*about to go to sleep* *lets just do one more heist/ job and then got to sleep* .... *completes job/heists* *how bout one more time* *completes job/heists* *maybe i can do one last one...* *cycle continues*  its 7am... 11/10",64.8
"i was happier when this game launched than when my first born child was born",45.4
"rockstar shows one more time how to build a masterpiece. gta v is not perfect but has everything youll ever dream in a sandbox game. san andreas is gorgeous and full of life, trevor, michael and franklin are a trio full of charisma and the game simply raises the bar in so many aspects. its worth your money, its worth your time.",37.0
"i was chasing a cat around the city... she got hit by a train... and survived... i got hit by a car... and died. 10/10 would chase the cat again and die. anyways.. this game works.. even on my potato laptop. i like it.",20.0
"i have a problem. my social life is now my second life.... well nvm back to gta..",66.7
"this version of the game serves as a glorious testament to the incredible power of the pc master race.",19.8
"played it for a few hours on pc. i have to say i definitely prefer it on the pc over the console version, it seems to run much smoother, looks nicer, the controls are easy, driving is definitely a huge improvement compared to gta iv where that was just awful all together. rockstar definitely proved me wrong, after the amount of rage i went through on gta iv and how much of a crappy pc port it was along with all the buggy video editor errors, all of that seems to be fixed in gta v pc with a tidier video editor and less buggy overall. oh and no more gfwl! yes! well done, rockstar. definitely worth buying.",15.9
"i couldnt enjoy this game on a console, but maybe its even better because i was familiarized for the first time with gta v on pc. the game is well optimized and polished, didnt notice many bugs yet, the graphics are stunning, even at medium settings. the gameplay is way more developed in comparison to gta iv and the story is promising to be very interesting. i dont regret any cent i spent for this game. totally worth it.",28.1
"another amazing grand theft auto game. ive been sticking with grand theft auto for 13 years or so now. still remember the day i ran to the store to get gta iii for my ps2 in early 2003. ive played all of them and now, including this one. even tho for some its just a game, for me. its become a tiny part of my past. not to sound like a obessed gamer of some kind lol. its just, if you follow a games developement for so long it becomes something special. good old grand theft auto :) 100/10",39.7
"franklin : hey babe! girl : yeah... whatever! the biech died! 10/10",26.9
"amazing game  take a dog out for a walk, play tennis, be a taxi driver and shareholder. i enjoy it so much. the story was great and funny in most of it =) make me keep following it. also the world look nice and beautiful, a lot of activities to do and a lot of thing that waiting us to find out ;) not a single problem i found. everything went fine for me. i loved and enjoy all of it.",59.8
"i play this at 720p, 24hz, and the lowest settings for the most cinematic experience.",17.7
"people who use xbox controllers get kicked from lobbys 10/10 would use keyboard and mouse again.",4.6
"at least it runs well on my pc. game itself is good. looks a lot better than it does on my nephews ps4. unlike the gta4, at least this one is not horribly optimized. this review would have been a positive had not a certain petty even occured. the moderators of this game are trolls. they ruined my perfect steam account with several bans. i was locked out of steam for a few days pending ban. i wrote a petty post stating too bad p!r*t3s are enjoying the game while we are just stuck with a preload. that comment resulted in ban. then i got in more trouble for contesting it resulting in a temporary lock out of my steam account. forget about steam support. they dont answer calls, and the ticket is a week old. maybe i should not have wrote it, but i dont think it was worthy of a ban of any sort. bottom line dont even say the word p!r*t3 or any other related word in any way. not even in the old definition before we had internet. you could say a racial slur, and nothing will happen to you, you say p*r*cy and bann. seriously though is steam becoming as evil as ea? ps. they keep deleting this review. so my truth must be getting to them. i keep rewording more carefully.",16.9
"we all know (or should know) that this game is excellent and probably the best gta of the series. so lets skip that! the forum is litterally filled with questions about if the game runs well without having a high end rig, so lets talk about that. i personally was worried as well about if i could run this game as i have a graphics card that doesnt even meet the minimum requirements, but i took the (expensive) gamble anyway. i was pleasantly surprised to see that the game ran fine right from the start! i could even go beyond the recommended settings and still have a very smooth and stable fps. so if you have a desktop similar or better then mine you should definitely be able to play the game! i5-3350p (@ 3.10ghz) 6 gb ram geforce gt-620 (2gb) 720p",42.8
"if you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. if you dont have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. if you dont have the game to play, get the money for it. if you dont have nice pc to play, get the money for it. if you dont have the money for it, get a job. if you dont have a job, rob the bank. if you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.",20.2
"game is awesome. simple as. so much to do. so beautiful. an insta-purchase that will keep me busy for many hours to come.",61.4
"found a plane, and struggled with the pc controls. crashed into a building. 9/11. crashed a beach buggy into a park. was offered a hit of marijuana and ended up shooting aliens with a minigun. 10/11. went online in the most ridiculous game of capture the flag ever, which ended in a giant pile of at least 50 cars in an intersection trying to steal evidence. 11/11. tried to say hello to a guy in online and immediately got shot in the face. 12/11, goty.",38.2
"someone smashed me with a plane and screamed allahu akbar 10/10",58.8
"60 fps or higher does a brutal difference, now it has exclusive pc content such as rockstar editor and a great community overlay. you can also notice a huge difference between ps4 or xbox one on graphics, rockstar did a great job. if youre thinking about owning this game, you should do it right now! as our friend, gaben, would say; - worth the wait. good job rockstar, im 100% amused. filthy , aka carlos",28.6
"runs really smooth and graphics look very nice! (running on a gtx970) if youve been waiting for the pc release its definitely worth it. if you played it for the console, graphics will be night and day :). graphics: 9/10 compatibility: 9/10 multiplayer: 9/10 editor: 10/10 (make your own movies!) chop: 10/10 (chop does what chop does best :) ) other notes: you can max out most of settings then lower down the shadows and still maintain about 60-70fps which is pretty good :)",14.8
"steps to playing gtav: play with friends -> have fun -> kill them for no reason have no friends? -> make some -> kill them for no reason would shot people, have cops chase me across the city, get blown up and die all for 50 bucks 69/10",28.4
"this game ruined my life. after traveling far across the city of los santos in search of a car that would help me appear more appealing to the ladies, i found a truffade adder sitting on the side of the road and took it as my own. i then proceeded to flaunt my newly found ride in and around the pier. soon enough a young blonde woman (who i can only presume loved me for my car) called me over to her and offered to make my night. i believed that we were going to go out bonding at a coffee shop and talk about our feelings, but before i knew it she was  my . little did i know i had been led under the influence of the earthly equivalent of a siren, known by many as a street hooker. i now have an irrational fear of fish nets, red heels, and anything pertaining to leopard print. i miss the fishing trips with my family. i miss being able to take my son to the exotic plains of africa on a leopard hunting expedition. my life is over. i can not go on living in this way. i do not want to go on living in this way. every day i wake up wishing i hadnt. someone please put me out of this hell. i will do anything. please... 11/10",41.5
"gta v on pc is finally here (which was delayed for 1 year, 6 months, 28 days), but it can easily be forgiven. because the content is already awesome and its technically stunning. it feels like a new los santos. there is no open world game that can match that. and the rockstar editor offers such an easy access and so many possibilities in terms of clips/movies creation that we can only be sure that the pleasure will last for a long, long time. the game is well optimized for pc as well. excellent work rockstar!",56.8
"the best gta, ever! - good optimization - good graphic - very detailed",10.9
"thanks for beta testing filthy console peasants! #thegloriouspcmasterrace #kappa #jk #whysoserious #inb4butthurt",30.9
"gameplay: 8/10 the game is good, the graphics are well polished but still has a little of stuttering that can be fixed in the next patch. optimization is ok, not too much as max payne 3 but still is good in these days.",24.0
"no more need for friends, family, or pets. my virtual life has finally gone sentient. farewell outernet, you sucked anyway.",57.5
"10/10 review this is the third time buying this game bought it first on ps3 and 2nd time bought it on ps4 and know bought it on pc! this game is so fun! it was easy to install and has really good graphics! absolutely amazing game and plays even better on pc! #console 60 fps all ultra setting i7 4790k 2k gtx 980s sc 16 gb ram",43.7
"well, what can i say? grand theft auto iiiii is another installation for the infamous gta franchise developed by rockstar. first impression was immensively outstanding. the ability to immerse yourself in the online multiplayer is extremely corporeal. this has everything that i could ever possibly want from a video game, and delivers ten fold. there is simply not enough time in the day to spend playing grand theft auto five online. it is pretty enjoyable. kind of wish i pre-ordered, but that is pointless considering it is easy to accumulate cash, if youre not wasting it on tattoos, cheap suits, or car mods after you complete each and every job, which, in my case, i have a bad habit of indulging in all of the above. to make a long story short, its fun. there could be a few improvements, but you know how the old saying goes... you wish in one hand, and poop in the other; which one fills up first?",13.7
"my first playing gta v on the first task. i accidentally killed guard -> mission failed i tried killing/running enemies -> dead driving by car -> got stuck racing the car -> lost on the last place running againts girl -> lost swiming -> drowned flying by plane -> damaged yoging -> hurting helicopter landing on the ground -> damaged oh man, i love this game.",23.6
"its definitely worth buying this game. the game is great, theres a lot of activities, i encountered only 1-2 bugs. the game is perfect. 10/10 but the mp side has more bugs, but the game is playable. 9/10",39.6
"so i havent played any gta since gta 2 (1997), and that has been one of my favorite games from my teenage years. i skipped gta 3 and 4 mainly because i didnt care for the change from 2d top down to 3d third person. however seeing the total biscuit review for the game convinced me to give this game a try. honestly, im blown away in regards to how good this game actually is. the attention to detail and the grand scale of the world is really amazing. i have only a few hours in so far, but i am completely sold by how good the game actually is, and look forward to playing it for many hours more.",4.8
"imma let you finish but gta v is one the best ports of all time... one of the best ports of all time!! it was totally worth the wait for a better version after playing it on ps3. theres a huge jump in terms of visuals. besides, custom soundtracks, mods, first person mode, better graphics, smoother frame rates, higher resolution, more music and of course, the best thing ever; the amazing director mode. i love you rockstar!!!! 10000 out of 10!",22.3
"i became a cat and managed to float above the ground. 10/10",21.0
"it still has some technical issues, nonetheless the game itself is perfect! it runs smooth generally but there are occasional crashes and glitches.",78.7
"this game rocks so much that i wanna be straight again. 10/10",89.3
"i read on kotaku that its better than civilization 5 with the brave new world expansion pack",57.8
"was doing a heist with friends. two friends start beating up a car, other friend gets pissed and launches a rocket at them and kills them both. mission failed. 10/10 would reccomend.",70.7
"i was waiting this game for a years! finally, when ive bought it in january, i got extra gift gta san andreas + 1.000.000$ in cash for online, and 500.000$ in cash for offline mode. the best game ever, they can say what they want, but this game is absolutely the best. works perfectly on quad-core 3.4 ghz, 8gb ram and 1gb ddr5 pci-e 3.0 graphics. :)",45.9
"it should be the best game of the year ... thanks r*",28.7
"while playing online with friends, hey guys, lets play some missions to level up. 3 hours later while jumping off a building into a pool by the beach, i say, werent we going to do missions? yeah... continues jumping into the pool.",47.3
"i wanna thank all the console players for water cooling my pc with their tears. 1010",68.2
"the game only works for about half the people that bought it. wait for a patch.",21.9
"literally better than you could ever imagine! a way better than how i expected it to be. im proud of you rockstar!",65.0
"great sandbox game, works fine on older pcs and laptops, patch fixed all my problems with game",22.9
"thanks for beta testing console players. #pcmasterrace etc.",43.6
"4 hours on single player and 4 on multiplayer so far. fantastic entry into the gta series. stable performance (normal settings) with an nvidia 560, though planning to upgrade to shorten loading times. gameplay and controls are top notch, gta ivs floaty character controls and sloppy, boat-like slippery driving are gone. controls have been well made for both keyboard and controller alike (logitech f710), though flying is a bit rough on the keyboard. only issues i notice are: loading times (again, old video card), cpu dependent, with a rather nasty cpu intensive spike whenever one is viewing a cutscene or in an interior (i5 2500k sb 3.30ghz) an odd issue where the game minimized whenever i attempted to use full screen mode (this was after 8 solid hours of gameplay)",55.4
"amazing game!! so glad i waited for this ultimate version!!! im getting very smooth 45-60 fps at 1080p with fx-8320, 16 gb, gtx750ti edit: forgot to mention - im running all settings at high or very high - game looks amazing and runs great on my system!",35.6
"amazing game! characters,gameplay,atmosphere and everything is perfect!!! 10/10",31.9
"i fangirled so hard when this came out. 10/10 would again",46.6
"amazing port to pc i run solid 60fps on ultra , ive only played online so i cant speak for the campaign but if its like the console campaign then its glorious. easily one of the funniest games ive played with friends. oh btw strip club tiittys realistic af ,thats all you need to know.",55.5
"rockstar fix your ing game, the stuttering in this game is ridiculous, the way the textures are streamed is ed up, after 20-30 mins the game just starts eating more and more ram to the point that it starts using the page file memory instead.... there obviously a memory leaking issue, and alot of people are having the same problem no matter the brand or how powerful the rig is. based on multiple users configurations, i can safely without a doubt that your game is not optimized properly. 3 delays for more optimization my , release a patch that can fix this memory leak, after that then i might recommend this game, but for now. hurry up with a proper fixing patch.",40.9
"i figured the game might actually work on launch day.. or the day after..",34.7
"- proud owner of large fedora collection and meme expert. but for real its ok.",17.4
"~lf a girlfriend, message me details+hobbies. ~best game of its genre no doubt. if you enjoyed the other gtas then this is a must get (even tho its been out for a while now on console) but now its on pc!!!! bring in the mods!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ~ps: gta4 was kinda dumb except for its graphics and next gen physics and stuff for its time (in other words it didnt really have much content/things to do but storyline and such). gta5 is that but on roids and full of things to doooo!",46.6
"developer rockstar did a great job with grand theft auto v for pc. the game runs smooth like butter and reaches an average of over 60 frames per second. i cant recommend this game more, go get it!",59.3
"great game so far. some performce issues even though i have a good pc but only when i enter new places. hope that gets fixed and this is by far the best game that has come out 2015 on pc.",40.1
"best game ever !!! i do not have words to describe how chicly this game 1110",55.5
"you cant play online without having someone blow up your car... then screaming in their microphone ooooooooohhhhhhh kidd get rekt m8 your so bad *swear words* mom comes in saying what the heck did you say and that kid says have to go sorry *friend*! *hangs up and leaves* and im like what the heck. also sticky bombs... sticky bombs",37.8

"screw all 4.000 people that vote negative to this game :) go and play mario then idiots u dont deserve to look at this game",17.3
"10/10/10/10! what an amazing game. it was amazing on the ps4 when i played it, and im so glad i bought it for the pc as well. i bought a new computer rig for it, and i play at 1080p nearly max settings all and get a smooth 60 fps! what an improvement from gta 4! i really do hope they release some fun dlcs, but i am also excited about seeing mods in the game! do you like cars, planes, helicopters, pure.. mayhem? gta 5 is for you! it is the ultimate amalgamation of fun! anything can happen in this game.. anything.. dont miss out!!",82.4
"roman is sad in liberty city. he wants to come and play. 10/10 (no bowling with roman)",46.8
"great game with an amazing singleplayer storyline which is long and fun to play. there are many side missions and things you can do if you ever get bored of the main missions. you can fly planes, drive boats or just go around doing whatever you want. the multiplayer is so fun and there are so many challenges and different missions/heists that you can do with your friends or anyone you want. there is so much to unlock and so many different vehicles to customize. you can buy houses, vehicles, planes, boats and so much more. the heists which were only introduced recently are fun, challenging and great to do with friends. i would recommend this game to anyone especially if you have played the previous gtas this game brings together aspects from every game which you will notice. the map features things like grove street and mt chiliad from sa and other gta games. overall this game is very fun and great to play with friends or alone and i would recommend it to anyone.",77.3
"im not sure with all these other people with bugs, but it runs great for me! and its very fun and beautiful looking. the only bug, so to speak, was that it crashed once. but so far, this is good!",30.1

"after playing the console version this really enforces that pc is superior. the graphics are amazing and its just so much better with higher framerates. 10/10 i skipped homework to play. now... time to start that powerpoint",13.0
"one of the most detailed game ive ever seen. worth its money and time spent in waiting. the true successor of grand theft auto series, now with even more detailed story. storytelling, graphics, activities, everything is perfect here. but grand theft auto: online is still crap, sorry. no heists can make me stay in 30-player world where other 29 are barely intelligent kids. and missions/races are boring as hell too.",66.7

"that dog smelled something and stopped following my orders ! wth ! this city has more opportunities than in liberty city. lots of love, rockstar.",46.6
"game is just stunning, a masterpiece, just gonna keep playing the shetz out of it. well, i fixed my game at first, it was stuck on social club loading after logged successfuly. maybe thats cuz my system name has a symbol -> . ... heres how i did it: if your username contains non-english or normal characters, then first create an empty folder wherever you want (for example: c:newfolder). then, right click on your c:usersusernamedocuments folder, select properties, and change its location to the new folder that you just created. the computer will then ask if you want to move all the files, say yes. after that, try running the game and it should work. update: now that a patch was released and a new social club, i can play just fine with everything back to normal.",51.7
"amazing so far. great sequel to the series and finally on pc. running on a gtx 760 at 1440p. 4k looks nice, but fps drops to below 30. buttery smooth @ 1440p. radio is very entertaining. the map has definitely changed alot since san andreas, but there are still some areas that are very close and reminicent of the older game. cars handle alot better than gta iv. switching between characters isnt as bad as i thought it would be. im also a big fan of how the map is not locked down from the beginning such as all the other gta games. first thing i did after the prologue was boost a car, drive to the airport and grabbed the first plane i found and cruised around the map (dat turbulence). love this game so far. only played online for a few minutes and hit rank 3. lots of potential and really looking forward to continuing this game. 10/10.",32.2
"amazing and addictive game of all time. better clean up your jobs before even thinking of playing this, because, once youre on it, you will be playing this till your  hurts.",29.9
"the wait was totally worth it. i found my definition of the word perfect in this game.",9.6
"rockstar made me hype for this game three times they made me hype for the last gen launch and in the end it was ing awesome they made me hype for the current gen launch and in the end it was ing awesome and now they made me hype for the pc launch and yes its ing awesome",74.5
"behold gta v on pc. all hail gaben. all hail the pc master race. jokes aside, plays at a beastly 60 fps on 4k resolution with 2 overclocked gtx 980s so im glad that it is optimised well for how nice the game looks. (just turn off aa, at that resolution you dont need it at all :3). as for online capabilities, much better than the torm that was launch on the peasantstation 3 and xbox #360noscope since you can actually play gta online without disconnecting 24/7 (all hail pc master race). *good on rockstar for not pulling another gta iv on pc",24.5

"i have played the game on both ps3 and ps4 and so far steam experience is the most adorable. game runs extremely smooth on my rig and the visuals are totally worth the delays game had during the development journey. if you are a fan of the serie or havent heard of grand theft auto ever, this is game you should buy if you are capable of running it. one of the best steam releases during 2015.",34.4
"easily the best version of grand theft auto that has ever been made yet! pc master race!!!",20.1
"i dont think anyone needs any introduction to this game so i will just comment on the port. the game runs perfectly at 60+ fps with all high settings with my gtx 970 sli. the new feature of having your own custom radio station that plays your music is a really great feature, just put your music files or shortcuts (both work) in the user music folder found usually at c:usersyour usernamedocumentsrockstar gamesgta vuser music. after putting the files just perform a quick scan in the in-game audio options and you are ready. my only gripe with this game is that it will be tied to your social club account and in case you lose the account then you wont be able to play the game anymore.",24.4

"one of the best game you can every buy! if ea gets there hands on it then it is the end of the world! im so gona miss roman asking to go bowling... he was my only friend....

"been playing gta 5/online from the xbox 360 to xbone and now pc, with my gtx 970, its great with very high settings and can transfer your character to the pc even tho you transfer from last to next gen. better controllers with the mouse and keyboard and 60 fps without any lay, i do recommend this game. just make sure your pc can handle it, would check on can you run it and make sure your drivers are up to date.",21.2
"this game is absolutely gorgeous on pc. no major problems running the game besides a few minor frame drops here and there. played on 360, and ps4, but neither of them compare to this. it felt longer waiting for this game to come out, but now that its finally here we can all relax and enjoy this beautiful masterpiece. theres no more to be said, time to go back to killing pedestrians and drooling over the new san andreas. if you love the gta series, then you need this game asap. 10/10",36.9

"this game is a huge upragde of the console version. but it also got a few downsides. pros: faster loading screen better graphics good standard controls millions of hours in playtime until you get tired heists which you can replay races apartments good flying controls almost bug free and i could do this forever.. cons: bad community (shooting everyone) a little harder in heists not really much bad stuff. its worth the 60 euro.. just.. buy it damnit!",60.8
"notebook users take note! gta v does not support enduro(amd) or optimus(nvidia). this means that you wont be able to play the game with your dedicated gpus, only your integrated intel gpu will work. if you try to launch the game with your amd or nvidia gpu ill crash right away. looks like r* never heard of gaming notebooks before, maybe they shouldve delayed it a third time... !!!update for nvidia users!!! seems like the issue has been fixed for nvidia users. amd users are currently still unable to run it on their dedicated amd gpu though.",1.1

"havent had this much fun in sandbox title since i first played gta san andreas (about 10 years ago). looks nice, plays nice, its masterpiece. only gripe i still cant get over is lack of san fierro and las venturas, but hey, its still great game oh and it runs waaaaaaaaaaay more smoother than gta iv. funny- newer game runs smoother than older one. shows how far rockstars pc versions have come i guess",37.6
"so as well you all know gta has always been a good game but the pros: linking your steam account to the sony account online works now good graphics from what ive seen so far heists work cons: i have to spam launch the game to get it to work it takes forever to launch sometimes it wont even launch at all its crashes a lot as well",50.3
"wait to get it. game controls are messy and even with my geforce gtx 970 the game still lags graphically. crashed twice on the repo michaels sons car mission. let the creators fix alot of the bugs first before you get it, otherwise the game is no different than consoles",24.4
"ive already played this game on console so the hours played are not correct... with that said. the game is way different from console. i mean... it is the same game. but it feels and plays much better. i max out the game and rarely get below 60 fps. if i ever do i get like 55 fps... not a big deal. so rockstar did a great job porting the game. it seems people are having issues logging in to the social club. i never had that problem. my friend did though. his steam name had a dot at the end (name.). once he removed that dot he was able to log in. it has something to do with the social club not working with certain symbols. the game: the story is crazy and filled with even crazier people. the longer you get through the game the more fun it becomes. i love the characters though i think rockstar did a much better job in red dead redemption when it comes to personalities. the world is filled with stuff to do so you will never be bored. if you somehow get bored theres always the multiplayer. ive not tried it yet on pc... but i can say the console version had a ton of variety in community made maps and game modes. i am sure the creativity of the pc gamers will outdo what has already been done.",19.0

"amazing pc port !! runs butter smooth @ 1920x1080 on my gtx 970 with almost all the bells and whistles turned on (and it does offer a huge variety of video options). the graphical fidelity is outstanding -esp. for an open world game. i am very happy they didnt dumb it down unlike so many other contemporary pc ports. beware of the ~ 60 gb download / hard disc space requirement though. the game also seems to be using up almost all of my 4096 mb video memory. so if you have a mid range pc, i suggest disabling anti aliasing and turning the texture quality sliders down a notch to ensure smooth gameplay. im not even gonna waste time reviewing the actual gameplay/storyline as this game has been out on consoles for almost 2 years now. but for us pc players it was certainly worth the wait. brb overclocking my gpu so i can crank up the msaa even more ... #justmasterracethings",9.8

"i dont even know where to start, this game is a huge improvement from gta iv. there is so much to do in this game that you cant get bored. i was playing on ps3 and ps4 before this, and i can say this is worth the wait. the hype was real before the game was released and still is even after the release. i was waiting for pc version since 2011. if you are a console gamer, there is nothing to argue, you cant beat the pc version, 60fps max graphics no problem on any modern pc. 3 playable characters - michael, franklin and trevor. the idea of 3 playable characters was really smart, i cant imagine gta v without that. i do not want to say anything about the story, play it ! everyone who is reading this - buy the game and support r* !!! if you ever get bored you should try rockstar editor as well as director mode, its hard but worth the while. you cant just explain this game in words. good job rockstar games ! 10/10",75.3

"huh,grand theft auto v on pc. in all seriousness,i always expected this would happen,but for it to be this good? nah. i wanted to write a joke review,i really did want to,but this game deserves more. having never played the console version,this was a real novelty for me,but no one can hold it against it for that because of some new things. those new things are: 60 frames-per-second 4k resolution and the rockstar editor. in 60fps this game feels really fluid,much more than in any of the consoles,but you already couldve guessed that from the trailers r* posted. i dont have a 4k rig,but i visited a friend that has one and it looks apsolutely stunning.no joke,even though its all caps ;). and i havent got around to playing with the editoer,but when the right time comes,ill do that. all in all,some will prefer to buy this on sale,but in my honest opinion anyone who can afford this game at $60 it is a very good investment.",51.7
"the fact that you dont have to listen to roman asking you to go bowling every few minutes should already be a good sign. provided that you have a decent enough computer, you should be able to run it quite nicely. when the graphics are turned all the way up the game can really look amazing. the controls can be a little wonky, but youre free to re-bind them to whatever key you want. (caps lock was the characters special ability button which was super annoying to reach) but in terms of how it runs on pc, i havent seen many glitches which is a really nice comparison to their 2008 release of gta iv.",17.4
"rockstar stepped up their game and fixed just about every bug in the game before the grand theft auto v release, which ultimately leads to an amazing game! at the moment the controls in the menu on the keyboard and mouse are a little funky, but i got use to it. overall, this game is by far one of the best grand theft auto games, if not the best game i have ever played.",71.1

"this game is great, but without mods it is kind of the same boring game, if you have previously played it on the consoles but with amazing graphics, compared to the consoles. the best thing about gta on pc is the mods that will be sure to come out, but as there are none yet the game is still kind of dry. this game is not very well optimised for pc players, as the keyboard and mouse controls are kind of unusual, this isnt saying they are unusable, but if a player has never played pc or gta on pc before then it takes some getting used to, which is why i recommend playing this game with a controller, unless you are exclusively playing in first person mode.",34.2

"works like a charm even on an older system (i7-2600k, gtx 570, 8gigs of ram). though you need really strong hardware to enjoy more-than-a-console type of graphics. anyway, rockstar came through with their promise of optimisation. great game, great pc version. 10/11, would would again. edit: quick tip - if youre using the latest nvidia drivers and nvidia geforce experience just find the game in your experience app and click optimize. it did wonders to me. everything looks so nice and it doesnt drop fps much if at all.",11.7
"10/10 great port (or at least seams to be so far) wouldnt revise again.",40.4
"i hear everywhere that people cant launch this game. people, if you cant even launch the game its probably because your computer isnt good enough. this game works like a charm, both singleplayer and multiplayer, which comes as a shock because i expected gta online to be unstable for a week at least. never mind that. game is great, franklin is black, michael is best character, end of story.",67.0
"bought gta 5 for the 3rd time, totally worth every penny. using 4k dsr+ultra settings on gtx 970 is so awesome, definitely 10/10 <3",73.6
"its the ultimate version. runs well on a decent but not bleeding edge pc, as well as my friends low end pc. beyond that, its gta v and its playable, i dont think i need to go much more length than that. all that said, it does have some issues that i assume will be patched. for instance, the ai during missions are generated by the host in online, which is usually fine except when that person has a piece of garbage pc. in that instance the game will drop your framerate to the hosts framerate when you get up close, which is horrifying. beyond that its everything we wanted and probably one of the best looking games ive ever seen. it is well worth the cost, and i wholly recommend it.",45.2
"amazing! few minor issues at start but now all is good! getting between 60 and 120fps constantly all on very high.",47.5
"stunning graphics, awesome characters and story. this is the game of the century by far. 9.5/10",62.4
"spent two hours waiting for this be unpacked, while sitting on the hype train, after spending two years waiting for it to be realized. launched the game had to make a social club, the servers were dying because rockstar could not comphrend the superior power of the master race, finally got to get into the actual game, pfft game auto set to 800x600 for the console peasants alright, spend twenty minutes changing graphics to the optimal master race specs. game looks great runs smooth. played through the intro nice, decided to try to play online, again rockstar didnt count the number of slaves from gta iv online was down. so, whatever game looks nice might as well play the campaign. two hours later, try to play online again it actually worked, but glitchy as the console. 100-200 cars but only in the color black. shoot a car until it explodes. car hell. steal a viper from some kid, sell it go to bed. spent the entire launch night wandering around waiting and making mass suicide runs while in skype call with five other master race  riding the hype train all night.",42.9
"very well optimized, even for old toaster setups. 1680x1050 with a gtx 660ti and a i7 920 cpu at the stock 2.6ghz has no issues maintaining 50-60fps in every area ive been to so far, most settings medium to high. there was some pretty glaring stutter at the auto graphics settings, but reducing soft shadow quality fixed it. population density is still nearly maxed out, and the world feels alive because of it. rockstar was wise to take their time with the pc release, they definitely didnt want a rehash of the gta 4 release fiasco. so if your specs are greater than mine listed above, you should have no issues running the game at high settings. its just as fun as it was the day i brought it home on the 360 - only this time its even better.",90.4
"wow... what a game. i pre-loaded this sometime over the weekend waiting for 4/14 but was released a bit earlier on the 13th. ive had this game on all the generations, 360, one, and now pc. let me tell you something... i honestly looked at the trailers and pictures for the pc and thought well, this doesnt look that much differnet for such a delay. until i pressed play... (i did have the windows account error - which was an easy fix for me.) the game is just purely stunning and the crisp sounds of engine and rifles. the story line... now that is an amazment that would keep you entertained for days and days! the gta online dlcs; some may be bad but then you have massive ones such as gta online heists which is just spectacular. this game could bring hundreds of hours of fun once you really get into it!",11.7

"gta 5 itself is a very fun game and the pc version makes it feel even better",38.9
"this game has to be one of the most handsome looking games to date. the game comes in a very smooth 60fps. it looks like rockstar has learned from their previous mistake, *cough* cough* gta 4 *cough* and optimized the living hell out of this game. i also did not have problems connecting to online the first day. the only downside to this mode is the freakishly long loading times. other than that, this game is very good, and if you have a powerful enough computer to run this no problem, then i suggest revisiting los santos one more time, in 60fps. it would be worth the money.",89.0

"if you cant get this game to run do us a solid and just walk into lake michigan. game is great buy it.",36.8
"the game is well optimized and it was was worth waiting for. the director mode is quite fun and is a good reason to buy the game, even if you already bought it before. you can play as characters from the story, pedestrians and even animals. (you can use your online character in single player). play as any character like the republican space ranger and you can enable cheats, making you feel like a superhero. youll be able to make some really creative movies with all the options theyve given you, an improvement over gta 4. theyve also added a custom radio station as well. this is truly the ultimate version of gta 5 and i highly recommend it.",60.5
"try launching the game with internet disabled if it keeps crashing! worked for my friend!",39.1
"well so far so good the game is good i love the way it looks i mean other than the fps drops and trying to get the launcher to stop crashing for almost 2 hours its pretty solid game. i fixed my launcher crash by disabling my anti virus and it loaded and played fine after that. anyways other than those issues i give it a 8/10",55.1
"absolutely amazing. everything is fun from the missions and heists that you do to the fun mini-games that you can play like tennis, darts, parachuting, and racing. what makes this gta stand out most is its brand online gaming mode which enables players to play a wide variety of different game modes and earn levels and money. its an incredibly polished game and a huge leap from gta iv which was also an excellent game. if youre a fan of gta, you must get this. this is the culminating point of fun and the best sand-box game ever developed thus far.",50.9
"you dont need mine or anyone elses opinion on why this is the best game that ever was, instead ill use this space to give you guys some troubleshooting info: game wont start (win 7) - make sure you have service pack 1 installed (win 7) this fixes most social club issues. - make sure you have the latest drivers. - .net framework 4.5 is required - disable antivirus and firewall for installation low fps with good hardware - turn of high res shadows - take postfx down a notch - use fxaa only for very high end systems (980, 780ti, 970, 290x etc) - watch the memory meter for vram, when setting up game, and add about 20-25% to get a real number of vram usage. - push settings up, one thing ive noticed is game runs much better when pushing the hardware. happy gaming",39.7
"nice touch for fun gaming, gta v online, heist, etc like every single roleplay",57.1
"game runs great! really well optimized! gta online works flawlessly, i have not had any problems with lag or bugs. the singleplayer story is the same, its interesting and intreaguing. in my 25h of game time (that 25h was all on gta online) i have come across 1 bug that has happened 3 times, the bug made it impossible for me to play a mission, it locked the camera on my characters face, restarting the mission fixed it. that bug will probably be fixed in a patch soon. one note about gta online though, in my opinion you need friends to play with, otherwise it will be boring, but thats just my opionion. what can i say, gta v on pc is awsome and you should buy it. rockstar worked hard on this game and the results are clear. 10/10",82.7

"amazing game, worth the 2 year wait! the game runs amazingly smooth, even whilst livestreaming to twitch (although my obs settings have to be set to stupidly low). here are my specs: cpu: amd fx-4100 3.6ghz quad core processor gpu: xfx amd hd 7850 2gb double dissipation edition motherboard: asrock 960gm/u3s3 ram: 8gb crucial 1600mhz ram ssd: 512gb crucial mx100 ssd hdd: 1tb hitatchi 7200rpm hdd so as you can see, my specs arent worthy of computer-gasms, but they still play this game in full 1080p. the only one negative thing ive found is more of a general gta v thing, not to do with the pc version, but on gta online, it feels very unbalanced. there was one player that was killing player after player all the time, and not once he died. the unbalanced thing was more that it spawned us in front of a hospital right round the corner, where hed come and kill us again. the controls also seem a little odd but thats my opinion, ive never seen a game that has e for the horn. in short, 10/10 no matter the small (opinion-based) negatives.",30.8
"try launching the game with internet disabled if it keeps crashing! worked for my friend!",39.1
"yes. i played this on the xbox 360 on the day it came out. there was no online, so i played the single player, then i realised that the rendering of the game was just awful! then online came out, i tryed it, it didint work at all, when it did it was fun. i would give it a 8/10, but on pc it fixes everything. the online perfect, the singleplayer perfect, the rendering perfect. so in short note 0/10 ign - too much water",34.4
"aside from the issues with installing the game, i give gta 5, easily, 5/5 ign, 10/10 gamespot, 6/6 demongaming. holy crap i think this is one of the best gtas so far. the optimization is better than i expected with the graphics, and since i waited since the pc version was announced, its even more legit to me now. see everyone online hopefully :)",24.7
"one of the best games ive played, graphics and sound are brilliant. thought id be disappointed due to hype but its a fantastic game, well recommended.",14.9
"you dont need mine or anyone elses opinion on why this is the best game that ever was, instead ill use this space to give you guys some troubleshooting info: game wont start (win 7) - make sure you have service pack 1 installed (win 7) this fixes most social club issues. - make sure you have the latest drivers. - .net framework 4.5 is required - disable antivirus and firewall for installation low fps with good hardware - turn of high res shadows - take postfx down a notch - use fxaa only for very high end systems (980, 780ti, 970, 290x etc) - watch the memory meter for vram, when setting up game, and add about 20-25% to get a real number of vram usage. - push settings up, one thing ive noticed is game runs much better when pushing the hardware. happy gaming",39.7
"nice touch for fun gaming, gta v online, heist, etc like every single roleplay",57.2
"realy nice game. the graphics are just beautifull. i think to play on high-end you need atleast 8gb ram, else you could play on 720p. the story mode is as fun as the online mode. there is just a lil problem, when the nat of your network is set to strict you may not be able to play online, but you can fix that in the router settings i guess. however i highly recommend this game cuz its so fun. so we will soon meet online then huh? ;3 -biscuit",46.3

"its here on pc now, is it worth it? yes! rockstar did a great job with the graphics and the game looks great with lots of attention paid to details and evnironments. they also did a great job with bringing life into the characters. the game runs completely maxed 1920x1080 on my system with full antialiasing (i7 4930k @ 4.5ghz and a gtx 980 4gb with 32gb of memory) and i get 50-60 fps constantly. its really fun, a big improvement from gta iv. driving is a little tough at first, but once you get the hang of it, its much better than in gta iv.",38.1
"ah, the legend returns to the mastah race! but more seriously, this game has finally arrived on pc with its fenomenal graphics (some dull textures here and there though) and stunning visuals with 4k support in all its glory! what i love: just about everything what could be better: mouse movement feels like it has a delay the gpu usage could have been better as i see some fps drop even if the gpu usage is at 70-80 ish. there is also a frequent happening of cars popping up from the ground, wheels on idle cars stuck half way in the ground.",57.6

"becomes a roadkill by insane civilians with panic issues... 10/10 would flip & fly in 1st person again. on serious note i would recommend this game to any gta fan, even on my  as pc i can play it on around 30 fps (isnt much but i can play it!), there are some issues with session disconnect etc but i assume its only during the first few days of launch of servers being overloaded and will be fixed soon as we go on, otherwise i havent encountered any issues yet & would defo recommend it as its nicely optimized for pc.",94.4
"oh boy,gta v on the pc the textures,the fps everything so perfect but the best thing about this game is that its actually fun driving around los santos mountains with your friends on an pick up truck driving around the city while your friends shoot out of the windows killing some noobs flying a plane across the map with your crew and jumping out to skydive robbing a bank to get some money to spend on hookers the list goes on and on baby",41.1

"iv played both console and pc now and i have to say im loving the pc version. faster game lobby load times. fast overall load times thus far. - (i know some people have had issues with this, however the unfortanate side is not everyone has an up to date system). the level of extended graphical detail options are amazing, especially at 60fps+ i would like to see a fov setting for first person (without looking to mods) no issues with online free mode disconecting every so often like i had happen on console. so far an amazing product. really enjoying it. thanks rockstar!",41.0

"i honestly cant believe people are throwing hissy fits about their games not working. since when is everything perfect? never!!!!!! this game is ing great and its 100% worth buying. its literally endless fun and people can go cry by themselves. yes, theyll need to get their game fixed but why does rockstar need a bad review? they dont because this game is great. people just need to be patient. yeah the game has bugs.... but you try porting a 32 bit console coded game to x64 with way more advancded graphics with oodles of content. i applaud you rockstar for giving us pc gamers this treat to even be able to play this game on pc. now your next slayer task is to port red dead redemption :p",18.0

"pros: overall a great game for the pc. if you are used to how this game looks on the console, you will be blown away by the graphical improvements and the gta experience at over 30 frames per second. there are a rediculous amount of settings so you can customize the game to your liking. the controller support is also amazing since gta v provides a seemless transition from keyboard to controller. i personally use a controller for flying and keyboard and mouse for everything else. the game as a whole seems so smooth, driving especially. cons: you have to start nitpicking in order to find something about this game that isnt up to par. the obvious for me was the excessive time spent on loading screens. finding a gta online game is a pain since loading screens can sometimes take up a substancial chunk of time. joining jobs and heists also have the loading screens. in the end, i couldnt recommend this game enough. the game itself is among the funnest ive ever played with the graphical improvements over the console version making it even better! buy this game and you wont be sorry!",30.2

"i played gta 5 for the first time on my ps4 and i was amazed at the quality of the graphics and the quality of the story after finally building my gaming pc and gta 5 finally being released on pc i thought that the graphics would just improve a little. but i was totally wrong after installing gta and running it for the first time i could definitely tell the increase in graphics. i would totally recommend you to go and get this game, if you have already played it either on a 360 or the current consoles i would totally recommend getting it again if your pc can handle it of course.",9.1

"looks amazing when i finally managed to stop it from crashing every 5 minutes. didnt seem to have any problems from r* social club either. like i said it looks incredible, i can nearly max it out with an amd r9 270x (make sure you download the updated drivers). pushing the textures detail up too high seems to make it a bit twitchy but still looks lovely. 10/10 would develop another stomach ulcer due to stress from figuring out why it kept crashing and thinking id just wasted 39.99 on an unplayable 60gb parasite again.",13.2

(gamepad for driving, mouse shooting). -i have a adata 256gb ssd but my game still take an average of 45 to 60 seconds to fully load the game. -the first person fov is horrible, it gives me headaches after a while. -when you die in a heist, you screen freeze on your characters instead of going in the sky. -even on a ssd and visibility at max, objects/pedestrians and cars still pops out of no where. i recommend this game even if you already have it on console!",48.4

"the game itself is absolutely amazing, if you have a good rig you should definitely pick it up. unfortunately for me it has a lot of stuttering (mostly in online), but i did remove some of the stuttering by removing the in-game steam overlay. i have got it to work sometimes where the framerate is 70+ on high (with an i7-2600k, gtx 770 & 8 gb ram) in singleplayer with barely any stuttering what so ever, but the game has a life of itself that i have no control of. amazing game that i sadly cant run too well. **edit 17th of april:** rockstar released a patch that fixed my game, so all the stuttering is gone and the game works just fine now. thanks rockstar! 10/10",37.9

"at the point of this writing, i have put over 32 hours into this game so far, i have only completed about 30-32% of the single player and i havent touched the multi player as of yet. the game is so much fun its insane. the music and talk programs grab my attention so much that all i do is ride around on motorcycles and listen to them. they are a few minor issues like random frame drops, but they are more annoying than game breaking. this is a great port; i highly recommend buying this game. 8/10. p.s: give my bro trevor some love too, just like franklin",37.4

"this game is amazing! im not going to go into the gameplay or story because you already know how good that is but the first person camera does have an advantage of the last gen consoles. q)how does the game run? a)the game runs very well even considering my specs arent up to snuff. q)what are your specs? a)currently i have a core 2 quad q9650 3.0ghz stock speed, 8 gigs of ddr2 800mhz g.skill memory, a gigabyte g1 gaming gtx970 and my game is running off of kingstons hyperx fury 240gb hdd q)what kind of framrate do you get? a)on high settings at a resolution somewhere between 1080p and 4k i get anywhere from 40 to 70 frames per second q)would you say gta5 is optimized better then gta4? a)yes i would, this game runs with better framerates while also looking drastically better then gta4 thank you for your time! buy this game without hesitation if your pc is similar or better then mine and you will have no issues!!!!",45.9

"for once, this is the first pc port i have ever bought for $60 to say that it was well worth the full price. game runs smoothly and i havent run into any major glitches so far on launch day. however, if you have a crappy pc, dont expect it to run well whatsoever. ive noticed this with some reviewers complaining that the game had limited video settings and bad lag just because their video card didnt have enough vram or their processor wasnt good enough to handle the load. aside from the windows user account name bug, the game is great. tl;dr: game is shiny and smooth, 5/5 would delay again.",31.8

"ignore the people who have weird names or bad pcs, this is good.",19.6
"best pc gta ever! but really, this game looks absolute stunning and runs well even on non top end hardware. im running a gtx770 and even with the game telling me that its using 2500 out of my 2048mb vram it runs fantastically smooth. gameplay with mouse and keyboard is working flawlessly aswell. story is very well done and the singleplayer has a high replay value. online is just a joy to play. ( when the servers work(but i only had 1 disconnect so far)) id advise everyone that likes action games to buy this amazing piece of software. 10/10 recommended",51.2
"to sum it up pretty short, it was well worth the wait and was sure worth buying the game twice, first on 360 then pc. four hours in on launch night and it is running flawlessly, at well above what gtav says i should be running it at as well (memory warning in settings with 2gb gtx770). the first person view is awesome, constant 60+ frames is awesome, the extra detail combined with extended view ranges is awesome. this release is just awesome all around.",35.2

"i actually never wrote a review before, but after playing gta v i decided to do it :o the game is totally out of concept. the storyline is about family problems, spending time with your children, and chasing after your cheating wife... there are also unnecessary activities like yoga and tennis.. they did even put it in some of the missions, and that made it very boring. the game doesnt give me the feeling that im playing gta, but the sims -_- however, the graphics are amazing and the requirements are low. the gameplay is also nice, so i can still recommend it.",51.2

"if youve played grand theft auto v on consoles, then you wont be disappointed. if you havent, youre in luck because this is indeed the definitive version. in my opinion, rockstar have done a wonderful job developing the game for pc. it was well worth the wait. the amount of graphical options means you can tweak the game to how you like it, especially if youre limited by hardware. the addition of the rockstar editor is just he icing on the cake. you may not be pleased with the price point due to when the game was released, but think of it as a brand new game being released in 2015 (because its that good).",31.3
"arguably the best pc port rockstar has done. it runs surprisingly well.. and im on a laptop. occasional frame drops during cut scenes, but other than that, mostly smooth frame rate. driving with a mouse and keyboard feels fine and somewhat weighted, minus sports cars. gamepad recommended for aircraft. the fov for fps mode requires a gander at, but i wouldnt recommend it if you are susceptible to nausea or motion sickness. overall, a solid port, minus low res textures during fps mode. this is arguably the best in the franchise.",22.1

"with all the disappointing and and  triple a games lately i was worried when i pre ordered gta v but i dont regret it now. the shaders are great, the textures are nice and the game play is great. the driving is a bit hard to get use to but everything else is great. the characters are interesting and i am actually excited to finish the main story of this game which hasnt happened since sleeping dogs. the game runs great and i could easily max it out and run it stably in full glorious 1080p @ 60fps and the best part is that i will never have to go bowling with nico again.",12.0

"absolutely amazing. gta v is so well optimized, its actually hard to believe. im playing on a gtx 760, set the settings to 1080p high and runs like a hot knife through butter (constant 60+). this is a prime example of how to do a pc port right.",77.8

"so far really dissapointed, lots of lag and freezing,without these lags and freezes game runs like a charm so they did something good there but still for me its unplayable due to these freezes and lags , i even tried it on low settings but same issue( my rig is above recommended ) and ofcourse the cloud servers have issues saving progress once in a while ( before fanbois cry this has nothing to do with my rig ;) ). and today for some reason my garage got bugged and i lost 2 of my expensive cars which were fully upgraded ( i am a returning player from xbox 360 ) and now each time i put a car there it gets duplicated but the duplicated one does nto really exist but still takes up the garage slot to park a car. if you want to play the game without issues and problems, stay away from it for 1 month and then try, hopefully rockstar has solved these issues.",92.4

"if you have a relatively modern pc (meaning build date of at least 2008, which is usually really pushing it) then youll run this no problem. the installation/launch errors are few and far between and if youre capable of reading and troubleshooting then its no issue. the game runs terrificly with 100+ fps (i prefer limiting it to 60) on my computer with a gtx 960, i5-4670k 3.4ghz, and 8gb of ram. 100x better than the console version, thanks for the beta test peasants.",15.4

"most gaming companies, especially ubisoft and ea, should take a lesson from rockstar on how proper optimization is done on pc games. very well executed rs! the delays really paid off and after a very long time i feel i got my moneys worth. what other company, nowadays, releases a game with such demanding graphics, which from day-one are fully optimized? which company spends actual time to release a polished product and values its quality first and foremost, instead of following the fast and easy money tactic? rs took its lesson from the gta iv clusterf@ck on release day and delivered a premium quality product. i run gta v with everything on ultra at a constant capped 60fps. finally a company that respects its customers and the glorious pc gaming master race.",31.1

"summary: -game is good fun and in greater quality than ever seen before in a gta game. - steering wheel and flight stick is not supported though which is a shame. - people got problems making their laptop gpu running the game. gta is gta, you run around blow up stuff, doing missions, climbing the ranks and making cash. the game has got crazy characters and during the game you get to play as different characters with different lives. despite this during game they will meet and work together to achieve their goals. when you arent doing missions, there is also tons of activities you can do. my overall impression is that gta 5 is just a little bit different in terms of features, compared to gta 5, but it still feels way more fun and overall higher quality.",40.7

"so worth the wait. this game does not feel like a port at all. it appears to be very well optimized and runs maxed out 40-60 fps on my r9 290 + 4ghz 1100t @ 1920x1080. with some basic keybinding adjustments and a multi button mouse, the game feels like its made for kb/mouse. i never played it on console and am only a couple/few missions in but it plays sooooooooo smoothly and the characters and dialogue so far are absolutely hilarious. music, cars, controls, everything is awesome. everything you could want out of a gta game + so much more. buy it, thats all that needs to be said.",10.5
"couldnt wait for this to come on and now that its out i can say it is worth it. running the game on maxed settings is bliss and the controls for the mouse and keyboard are league better than using a controller. even though i have played gta 5 across 2 generations of consoles and clocked over 200 hours on it i can say without a doubt that the pc is the true version. rockstar have made an amazing port to the pc. went straight into online with no problems and a full game straight away. cant wait to play it more and with friends when they have downloaded it.",18.4

"all these negative reviews are people complaining that they cant run the highest settings on their laptop or some  with social club. man it really doesnt take a genius to figure either of these things out. it runs fine on my computer. social club works fine. its a huge open world so i didnt expect to be able to handle the absolute highest settings but the game still looks phenomenal without them. and its the most fun ive in a gta game to this day. my only complaint is the first person fov but someones already made a mod for that.",82.5

"aside from the mouse sensitivity being tied to the framerate (makes the 1st person view seem awkward and unnatural), which i assume will eventually be patched, it is a really solid port. i experienced no issues whatsoever getting the game to launch or run, and despite my low playing time as of this writing (~5 hours), no crashes. i7-4790k @ 4 ghz/gtx 970 on very high settings / high shadows / no msaa gets me ~70-90 fps @ 1080p with occasional dips into the 50s during high intensity action. online character transfer from ps3 worked on launch day except i had to go to the barber and change my eyebrows and remove lipstick; and i retained my vehicles as well. the bad: 100% sp progress did not transfer :-/",14.4
"so far, its amazing, there has only been one bug fix update and i am waiting on some more to come out before i give my final opinion. i am currently experiencing big frame drops about every 20 seconds and it gets worse as i play. oh crap, the game just crashed, thats also something to remember. anyways, the game is still gta v but with better graphics and new pc only tools. i do reccomend this game as updates are coming soon to fix the bugs, one at a time.",30.8

"review for gta v online from programmer and game designer perspective. - gta v online feels just as crappy as a singleplayer with simple networking slapped on top of it. nothing technically amazing with a sloppy game design. - loading screen and lobby waiting problems are much worse than in left4dead2. - your are forced to connect to open world and spawn in it every time you want to join a lobby, what takes a lot of time. - there is no open world, but only separate world instances with only up to 32 players. - bad community. everybody loves steamrolling noobs who dont know about enter passive mode button. why it isnt enabled by default for new players ? - learning curve, you will need somebody to hold your hand when you just start playing. - barely achieves high fps and playable game smoothness on notebooks with gt 750m videocard. verdict: kinda nice game to play when youve got nothing else to do. but i do not recommend playing it online alone without friends. if you are buying it just for online features - its not worth the money.",7.8
"worth every cent of those cs skins ive sold for it! :)) i really really love this game, basically you can do anything, even going to the  ladys  :)) like in real life, you just need money! online is awesome also! i can play counter strike if i want ... or i can race and feel like playing nfs ! :) what else do you want from a game ? + a cool story line .... definetly would buy it again and again! 100/10 :d thanks rockstar! best game this year :)",36.0

"i really love how i dropped sixty dollars on this game and downloaded the whole 59 gigabytes for days and at the end of the day when i launch this game i have to log in to the ing rockstar social club. yes thats right, you drop cash on this and the entire game is stored locally on your disk and you need to get an authentication from rockstar to launch it. no offline mode. there isnt even a hash of your last log in which would serve as authentication. great game but this ubsurdity ruins it.",8.9

"simply broken and wont start. unless i disable my graphics card. well done, rockstar. best money wasting simulator 2015. edit: after finally being able to get into the game after a recent patch, now i can say..  this game! from the bottom of my heart, im more disappointed and pissed off then ever. its  and so overrated. not even being close to worth the price - especially considering all the problems. i want a refund and now. this is not a bad game. but not worth the price tag and not even close to 10/10, or even 9/10. its a 7.5/10 at most.",1.8
"ehh, its ok... the work theyve done is great and is easily worth the game cost alone. however, craftsmanship aside, this is a bit better than gta4 technically speaking, but not better than gta3: san andreas immersion/story-wise. - its a bit of a cheap gimic for game makers to let users create their own content (movie mode). that was a novel idea back when minecraft came out... now its just lazy. - the missions feel cobbled together and the character switching requirement/feature causes immersion loss. - main characters are as deep as a kiddy pool, and supporting characters are mostly just annoying and not lovable. + trevor, however, was really well done! + graphics, controls, cars, city, diversity, engine, optimization are all cinima grade awesome. all in all, its fun to screw around gta2 style, but at $260-ish million development budget... they could have done considerably better. rockstar, if youre listening and think i should shut up or put up... deal... ill help you build gta6 :)",59.9

"this has got to be one of the biggest shams of all time. the online features that gta v have are horrible. servers are always empty, when you have finally gotten a server with people youve already waited through hours of load screens. once you finally get a 4th person for a heist you load the session and one person leaves so you automatically fail. this  is just horrible for a game releasing in the year 2015. i mean you cant even always play on the same team as a crew member. if im playing team deathmatch i dont want to have to play against my friend.",25.6

"for the most part, this game is great. its everything a pc gamer wants from a game. great storyline, fantastic graphics, 60 fps, you name it. but there is one thing that is so serverly aggravating that it is preventing me from giving this a good review. its the fact that every single time i try to join gta online, it forces me to sign into to social club. dosent sound bad, right? well, the issue is, every single time i try to log in nothing happens. absolutly nothing. in fact, when i sign in, it actually logs me out of the game, forcing me to restart my game. i cannot join online because when i sign in it sits on the sign in screen and does, as i mentioned before, absolutly nothing. it dosent look like its trying to sign in, it dosent look like its trying to do anything at all. so now my friend and i cannot play online together, which is a huge shame considering how everything else about this port is amazing. its almost as if i can only play 50% of the game, because gta online is such a huge part of the game. hopefully, rockstar games will fix this issue. if that is to happen, i will change my review for sure.",21.7

"the game is giant, full of content, innovation, the storyline is interesting, every mission is interesting, nothing you do feels repetitive, the game easily immerses you into its world, having 3 characters, to me, feels like rockstar covered every single point of view that you usually get from gta protagonists, franklin for the times of gta: sa, michael for every other protagonist, and trevor for those crazy rampages you used to go on for no reason, just because its fun to kill people. currently, gta: online is full of annoying bugs and is barely playable, the servers put you in with people all across the world, chinese, australian, which makes playing with them impossible due to lag, and ruins the overall experience, rockstar has a lot to fix before online becomes fun, but you can still go ahead and give it a try.",55.8

"been waiting for this for a long time but i have to say that this time it disappointed me. despite the numerous beautiful 4k screen shots of gta v thats been released earlier, you might have gotten hyped for this game like me, but after several developemnt delays, the result is that the graphics are not even up to par with watch dogs, which has been downgraded a lot. since ive played ps4 version for awhile, it is easy for me to say that the console version looks much better. maybe i need a better graphics card or cards and a 1440p 144hz monitor rather than a single gtx 770 gpu and a cheap 1080p 60hz monitor build to fully immerse myself in this game, but this time, i only wish steam has refund policies because i cant see myself spending hours on this game getting distracted by those jagged lines and mozaic-like textures.",4.3

(1) the game actually has a fairly interesting story. i find myself not skipping the cut scenes for the most part. (2) being able to switch between characters is really cool. (3) fps!! first person mode is really cool. i like being able to switch when i want (4) graphics. wow! the game looks so pretty on my 5820k/gtx980 combo. (5) smooth. the game feels so smooth at release -unlike watchdogs which is still a buggy mess. (6) the game will still provide hours of entertainment even after you finish it. conclusion. it was worth the wait. but, with all of the money they have made, they better hire some more people so that gta vi gets released on all platforms at the same time, like every other normal company does.",36.9

"short answer: this game is a must-own. buy at earliest convienience. fantastic game, fantastic pc version - highly recommended. online is great for a laugh with mates, and the singleplayer is one of the best open-world sandboxes i have ever had the pleasure to play around in. story is great too, shooting is very max payne-esque (this is a good thing), driving is fun, exciting and fast, and the attention to detail is incredible, as usual from rockstar. either get this game now if you cant wait, or just wait for it to go on sale. either way, this title is a must own. pc version note: my only advice is for you to please make sure your pc is up to spec. a lot of the bad reviews are coming from people have not ensured their rig can handle this game, so before you purchase take a look at the system specs down below and see if youre okay. other than that, this game runs great on my rig.",39.2

"its not a perfect game, but its a damn good one. the storyline and atmosphere might not be as strong as older titles in the series, but as far as gameplay goes this is definitely the most innovative game of the franchise. the cover system is kind of clunky (and this is disappointing considering that the cover system in max payne 3 worked pretty well) but you can do fine without using it. the guns feel like they have force behind them, the driving returns to the arcadey style of older gta titles but with more reliable physics, and the game world is so detailed and varied that not a single inch of the map feels copy/paste. is it worth the launch price of $60? thats arguable, but if youre looking for a fresh third-person shooter this is worth a look.",20.1

"- newbie to the gta series - the only gta game i ever played was the very first one that came out in 1997 on pc. i decided to buy this one due to all the hype and the much talked about graphics improvements. i have never been this satisfied paying $59.99 for a game ive barely knew anything about - much less played. the level of detail put in this game is amazing. everything from the graphics to the story line, truly impressive. this is the type of game that you dont have to worry about completing in a day. i am looking forward to playing this game for many months. there are small issues here and there that i noticed as far as bugs in the game but i anticipate they will be fixed in the near future. if you are on the fence about this game, i definitely recommend it. as a newbie to the series, i am glad i pulled the trigger on this one. funny acting, great story line, impressive graphics, tons of missions, awesome online multiplayer and it will push your high end card(s) to the limit. 9/10",57.2

"moving on from the console versions of gta v, even after months of delaying and waiting, this game proves to still amaze all gamers. obviously, the graphics is the biggest upgrade, but the delation for the release of the game turned out well for its great optimization to the pc port. its amazing how relatable gameplay is with consoles just by using a controller. feels like theres no difference except (better) performance, graphics, and details in the game (like its music). i already owned a 360, ps4, and xbox one version of gta v, but it was well worth $60 to buy the pc version. you get what you paid for, and even more. this pc port is what every game developer should aim for. how optimized it is at launch compared to other games that releases a dead-bugged game that makes it almost impossible to play. its safe to say that all gta players will be missing out on a new experience if they dont purchase this game. 10/10",32.7

"pc gamers rejoice. its is a beuty of a game. i only been playing for a few hour but the whole time it been so stable. i will recomend and most defenetly give a thumbs up to the game. just please be aware that you will defetnetly need some power to run it. so all the negative comments you will see are from people not knowing their hardware capability. i havent have the chance to see sli work either. a far as i know with a 8350 and a gtx 770 with 4 gb it does a good job, unfortanely i know my hardware and yeah.... i need an upgrade. running this with a 2560x1080 monitor i would recomend a gtx 980 minimun to max out your graphics woth most things cracked. now for 4k i recommend and r9 295x2 or titan x sli. i will let you know even then will you have some trouble maxing the game. also 2gb or vram wont cut it 4gb required, 8gb recomended and 12gb might do it, yeah this game rules it is well optimazed and uses every bit of power your pc can give. i would like to thank rock star for this amazing title and the fun with it and as for now i will be going back to play.",70.4

"first of all, the pc port was well worth the wait. the developers thought of everything; from showing how much vram is in use, to including a whole separate game mode (rockstar editor). performance is great and the graphics are stunning. overall, its just a fantastic pc port. ive been holding off gtav on the consoles because i wanted to experience this game completely fresh on the best possible platform and holy moly am i glad i did. after about 6 hours, its abundantly clear how marvelous this game is and i get to experience it at its maximum quality for the first time, w/o any spoilers or nothing. the gameplay is solid, the aesthetics are beautiful, and man, the story is phenomenal. i mean, im no real world gangster/etc kind of guy. hell, i really dislike the theme entirely and tend to avoid other games or media of the sort, but the writing in this game is just so top notch, so well thought-out, i found myself being invested in the characters and their stories. (havent touched the online yet so cant comment on that) ive barely scratched the surface of this game, but i believe ive played enough to highly recommend this game.",43.3

"this game is amazing! the singleplayer is very dramatic/cinematic and has the feling of a movie about a group of thieves coming together to perform massive hiests. as for the multiplayer it feels like theyre trying to get you to buy shark cards as the online ultimatly feels like a huge grind but over all is still very fun and with the addition of hiests this gives the game a new feeling to it making players who have played the game for houndreds of hours to come back and play even more! so overall this game is worth buying the only thing i think needs changing is the grind in online. 11/10 ign 100% legit",24.9
"never had so much fun playing a male rottweiler banging another male dog (in one of franklins missions). onlines working well with all rookies laying around. graphics very optimised. still have stutter problems now and then. other than that......100/10 would always play this superior version.",51.7

"definitely a good game but we all know that. i havent tried the multiplayer yet because i want to finish the singleplayer first (first time playing gta v). pc version is a very good port with good optimization and good graphics at the same time. careful of the advanced graphics options those are very demanding. with those turned off, msaa x2 and everything else on maximum settings on a gigabyte gtx 970 mini im getting 55-60 fps. i had a minor scare during install because it got stuck on 99% for a while saying busy writing to disc but that was because i had pre-loaded the game and it was decrypting so dont worry if you have the same thing it will eventually install (mine took 20-30 minutes)",55.2

"while technically a great game, i cannot recommend it to people like myself who have grown up with the series and find themselves with much less time to indulge than when they were young. i just find myself not really getting into the game as i did when i was young doing random  just isnt as satisfying anymore.",15.5
"lovely game with so much content. i played on xbox 360 for hours on end and this is no different and is worth a buy. now go! loosen your wallets! let the 60 bucks fly unto steam cards and then purchase this gamr brcaause this is pretty much the best game on steam as of right now! 10/10!",6.5
"plays amazingly best port ever! cant even call it a port. rockstar!!! thank you for taking your time with optimization and giving us pc gamers a great release. sure there are some people unable to play but this has been a much better release than final fantasy realm reborn, or say any ubisoft title. i appreciate all of your hard work this last year and some. it really shows in this pc version of the game.",20.8
"all i have to say is pc master race! 10/10 for me a good launch and ultra 60fps best ever cant belive i played this on console will never go back to console now after this thank you rockstar even with the delays better then the gta iv launch by far pre-order worth!",16.5
"i have waited a long time for this, and it couldnt be better.",32.7
"best game now, runs well, worth the money and waiting 10/10",33.1
"oh my god im so glad its finally available. with every new release it gets better. last gen to current gen consoles and now pc. i wish i had a 4k screen to really test my graphics card. 1080p is still pretty too. keyboard controls take some getting used to. a few commands are slightly out of reach but you dont need them often enough to be a problem. supports 360/one controller out of the box and it feels just like the console control. ill probably use both to be honest. mouse/keyboard for running/shooting and controller for driving/flying. analog steering for the win. the load times are near instant for single player and the online is significantly improved compared to the console. first time i joined online, i tried to get the high priority export car only to be met with explosions and fire. 10/10 will explode again.",17.8
"actually optimized. its how watch_dogs shouldve been optimized. if you like having fun. pick up this game.",50.5
"rockstar did an amazing job with this port. while my single gtx 770 isnt running the game at full ultra, its pretty close to it. much closer than i expected, after gta iv and many of the overhyped games to come out recently. this game looks absolutely amazing. i havent played as much as i would like yet because of work, but i will be playing when i get off. gunplay is as good as ever, driving is smoother, switching characters (not that ive done it much yet) works exceptionally well, and its all bound together by one of the most beautifully rendered games ive ever seen, and certainly the best open world in terms of visuals. i havent played on console since ps2, so this is my first time playing this amazing title. if, like me, you are a true pc gamer, you will pick this game up. even if you are a cross-platform heathen using both consoles and pc, you should pick this up if you are interested in the in-game video creator. it seems like a great feature to play around with, though i will wait until ive beaten the campaign first.",52.5
"it forcess you to have rockstar account. it automatically assigns the rockstar account with the steam account. it cannot run without internet. if you ever used some dummy rockstar account with your steam account you will not be able to run the game as you can not use different account and can not access the dummy account. in other words i can no longer play rockstar games on my steam account, and all the ones i bought are unaccessible.",5.8

"this really is the best version of gta v! well worth the wait :)",10.3
"this game is obviously fun and funny, it gives us what gta iv didnt and then some. now even though i recommand this game there are problems with it, one in particular which needs to be fixed asap. laptops with two graphics cards (usually an intel one and a deticated one from amd or nvidia) cannot currently run this game without a whackey workaround which doesnt always work. this needs to be something they fix in a week to two weeks time or else youll have a massive flood (which you already have so why would you want more?) of people who complain on steam, on their forums and to their costumer support that the game is broken and they want a refund.",16.6
"awesome graphics and finally a optimized pc game for once! even with a 780 ti with 3gb vram, its not enough to fully max out the game. if it were a 6gb variant it would easily do so. wouldnt recommend playing on a laptop with anything slower than a 980m. good buy",28.0

"ive been trying to fix the game for 3 days now. the social club failed to load due to an incomplete installation (code 16) ^is the error i get, and ive literally done everything there is to try and fix this issue, but it just cannot be fixed. so much for spending 60 euros on a game and not being able to play it. :( i like the game though, 10/10. :)",31.3

"ive played the console versions of this game and it is fair to say that this is worth the wait. gameplay was great in both 3rd and 1st person mode (dont recommend first person if you have motion sickness), the cars didnt feel slippery, the campaign feels like sort of episodic (if i spelt that right) and the graphics were impressive. especially on the last gen versions of the game. 10/10 ps. be prepared to run into high level pr*cks going on a rampage in their tank on the online portion of the game",7.8

"seriously one of the best games ever made. we waited too long for a pc version and the result is very, very good.",25.3
"the patch and amd driver update (beta) actually made the game a lot faster and more stable (it was barely playable at first). there are some technical flaws thogh. nice visuals, quite stable fps, a-lot-of-new to explore and learn. suddenly theres something more time consuming than skyrim. i didnt try gta online yet since my internet is very unstable atm; people say its chaos and the most of the time you watch load screens, not los santos. im very happy with the singpleplayer so far. maybe the game is not totally worth the full price (i usually buy games on huge sales), but its not waste either. so, im pretty happy with the buy and i look forward for new updates/fixes. specs: msi gx70 laptop (fullhd) amd a10 5750m (2.5/3.2 ghz) radeon hd8970m 2gb gddr5 16gb ddr3 1600mhz 7200 rpm hdd win7 64 settings: 1920x1080 high texture quality high shadow quality high reflections quality softest shadows v-sync: half (30 fps) fxaa the rest is low/default. 9.5/10 (not so satisfying shooting, few other things are off, otherwise very enjoyable). 2015-04-17",19.7

"10/10 amazing to play this game @60 fps. only problem is that the game crashes frequently. hopefully rockstar will patch this in the future. :d",11.1
"by all accounts a good, well optimized game. the ui, controls are fantastic. the graphic options and graphical quality is exceptional, especially for the performance i get on low-end hardware. they really put a lot of work into optimizing this and tweaking the engine to perfection. far more than any company has anything else released in years. that is, if it runs at all. theyre dragging their feet about fixing the myriad of issues which plague many players. at this time i do not recommend buying it with a 50% chance that itll just crash repeatedly, either during the intial launch of the launcher itself, or during gameplay.",52.9
"i can without a doubt say that this is my favorite game of all time. on the ps3 ive spent over 500 hours in it, and im gonna spend even more on pc when its been upgraded so much. definitely recommend this.",48.6
"after watching the positive pc port report video totalbiscuit made i figured gta v would be a great pick up, but unfortunately i ran into so many issues rightaway that i ended up requesting a refund which was still an option due to the other problems the game had. issues i had: - jerky/laggy mouse movement in the menu. changing vsync or mouse input didnt help. - settings didnt save after quitting the game and restarting - display calibration screen on every start - benchmark crashed to desktop after a 3 minute black screen - fps tied to sensitivity (not this crap again, sigh) i run a i7-4790k, 16 gb, r9 290x machine and from what i could see from my short experience, the actual framerate ingame is fine so performance seems ok otherwise. this is the first refund ive ever requested and im glad it was still an option. fully priced games, in this case even more, should always have an option for refunds to avoid these sorts of things. one thing steam could learn from origin. i hope they patch the game and fix all these issues because i am certain the underlying game is brilliant, but i just cant support it while theres so many problems before even getting to the actual playing part.",0.8
"amazing game, rockstar obviously wanted to do the best delivery of a game they could and even if they didnt, that was achieved anyway but im sure they were. amazing graphics, better than any console graphics, 60fps makes it so much better and feel like youre actually there at times when youre in the amazing... 1st person mode! which you get on ps4 and xbox one anyway but still it looks way better on the pc. director mode makes it way better aswell because you can play as so many different characters and costumed characters which is alot of fun when bored in the game. definitely recommended (if you have a graphics card of atleast radeon hd 7770) but it might look alright on a lower one, but yeah definitely recommended!",16.4
"i love this game. i have played it on ps4, but its whole differrent experience playing on pc at 60fps+. the game very well optimized. i did encounter some problems at the launch though, but i looked it up online and made a new a local account on win 8.1 and boom rock stable. if you have money to buy this game, buy it now!. you wont regret it.",51.2
"spent hours murdering an increasingly furious child online. there was a crack of thunder, a flash of lightning, the heavens opened and his bullet-riddled corpse was drenched by the fresh, cooling rain - a glorious hd rendering of his tears crossing from the real world into the game. 11/10 - would buy again just to relive that moment.",10.6

"very nice design, story and most important, optimization. all recommendations and 10 of 10.",21.3
"game is not launching what can i say more! i havent seen anything like this in my life before! in last 3 days i sent e-mails to both steam and rockstar and non of them have sent me a solution massage yet. f*** the solution, i want to know if they are searching for a solution or not, i want them to just let me know about the process. this is f***ing an inpolite behaviour! this f***ing game is a trash right now do not buy it if you dont want to be cancer. this is a terrible failure for both steam and esspecially rockstar games. from now on, i am not going to buy any rockstar games product before reading commends to see if the game is fully working or not. this bad recomendation will stay here untill they fix the game. thanks for steam and rockstar to ruining my week. f*** you all!",2.4
"im just at beginning of the game and this is some kind of a first impression comment, but still: its crazy good! worth the wait for pc too, engine is so smooth and realistic. if you like these kind of games, youll have to own it proudly.",24.5

"man, this game really is great. its absolutely beautiful, the story is compelling, and its bigger than ever! the only problem is that..its not optimized for pc, oddly enough. it has issues using the full power of some peoples gpu, including mine. despite being able to run the game at 40-50 fps on medium high settings, you get wierd dips, stutters, and micro sound-cut outs at times, or, your fps will randomly drop to 20 and stay there for a minute, even when youre just standing still! when they release a better version ofthe game, it will have my full support. right now, im just not feelin it.",42.1

"my computer isnt even a toaster and it cant run this game. its slighly better than the system requirements, and i can hardly play the game without rage quitting from the lag. i would only really recommend this if you have a great computer, otherwise i would wait until they fix the lag.",1.4
"awsome, if your game launcher crashes just disable your gpu in begining and turn on before game launches!! this is because your gpu is not supported cuz rockstar hates you and wants to make you addicted to this game even if you dont have what it takes to run it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",21.5
"first of all, let me start off by saying they never should have released a game as broken as this. i cant run it for 20 minutes without blue screening, but that doesnt change my opinion of this game. it is still one of the greatest games in the franchise, and of all time in my opinion. (vice city will always beat out the others for me). for the small time i could play it, the controls were incredibly fine tuned and responsive, and the controller support is phenomenal. the game is very well optimized, especially if you have the newly released amd/nvidia drivers. the level of detail is wonderful to have, and was nice to see coming from the ps3 version. even though its currently a broken piece of , i will still reccomend it.",13.2

"tl/dr : perfect, stable, extrem fun and awesome optimized. now a little bit more detail... +great singleplayer storyline +many activities like playing tennis (just as good as playing a standalone tennis simulation!), doing yoga (if thats your thing), stealing cars, robbing stores, participate in races on the street or on dirt, doing heists with a group of friends (in mp) or with your ki-controlled team (no stupid ki), getting drunk doing yoga after a set of tennis and much, much more. +all vehicles are feeling nice to use with a nice way to control via mouse+keyboard (wasd + num-pad). +many guns/weapons in gerneral (all of them can be modified) even thou the gunplay isnt that good. +multi-charakter story with each being completly different + special abilities. +cops are (finaly) a threat! onto the technical point, i am using a gaminglaptop with the following stats : geforce gtx 880m i7-4810mq @ 2.80ghz 16 gb ram game is installed on a ssd. i am able to play @ 60 fps/1080p with highest settings (msaa @ 2x). so this game is very well optimized. in about 24h gameplay i didnt face any crash or gamebreaking bug.",58.9
"i have an problem starting it,cant even start it and it just says loading,after i signed in at social club,any one else having the same issue? please if rockstar isnt fixing it and you know it post it on their website because i dont know if they will,other wise it is probably a good game",26.1
"from what ive seen in videos the game looks great, however for me its not launching at all, when i click play it says im in game for a very short time then nothing, it doesnt launch and it says im no longer in game so until this is fixed i cant recommend this game.",24.5
"this game is absolutely without a doubt amazing on pc. ultra settings above 60 fps at 99,9% of the time. the only thing that feels very weird for me are some of the controls. example: flying. ive never flown in a game with numbers before. but after getting used to it its all good. would recommend.",34.5

"i preordered this game and on release date it doesnt even ing work. i didnt want to pay this much for playing loading screen simulator.",48.2
"if you only own a keyboard/mouse combo (or plan to only use one) gta is ready to frustate you. gta loves to throw you into the deep end without prep time, wether its driving, shooting, diving or flying. flying however is the worst, with default pc controls being an unworkable nightmare that also happens to be delivered while being shot at. from my current perspective flying in gta v is about -10 of fun and there is no excuse for it. it isnt just dedicated flying titles that do it better, like world of warplanes, but also so called rivals - where one presume rockstar paid at least cursory attention to - like the saints row entries 3 and 4. they all can boast better control schemes right out of the box and that makes the poor performance of gta on this front all the sadder. im now off to see if that gamepad i bought for emergencies is any better at not hitting the virtual ground but even it is - why the hell do i need to install an entirely new input mechanism when there a several aaa title that dont need it ? steering planes on a pc isnt some new and arcane art.",45.9

"loading screen simulator 2015 (for online, that is) seriously though, ever since my mom first banned gta from my brothers and mine game collection, its been a favorite of mine. gta 5 is the ultimate gta. everything annoying in the old games is gone, and just the right amount of realism is there. story mode is great and takes years to beat, and online mode is basically a second, more personal customized story mode. i just wish it hadnt taken so long to come out.. but hey, perfect things need a lot of polish ^-^",57.3

"the single player is very robust and runs as smooth as silk without a hiccup. the game is a breath of fresh air compared to how grand theft auto iv ran on pc. no more gfwl and optimisation issues. the rockstar editor is also a very agreeable addition. however, the online from my experience is somewhat negligent. i have experienced 2 game breaking bugs: for the first one; the entire screen freezes except for the mini-map, for the second; the game sometimes gets stuck in an infinite loading sequence. in both of these scenarios, i ultimately have to shut the game down via the task manager. overall i am quite impressed, but also completely confounded by how unstable the online can be at times; especially considering the copious amounts of time rockstar had to perfect this game on pc. i will rate this game as an 8.5 for now. my opinion will very likely increase if rockstar remedies the online issues and as more enjoyable mods arrive.",54.2

"so ive had a good chance to play the game now. and i am really impressed on how its turned out. graphically, its insane. its really really stunning. driving along the coast at sunset with your own music on the radio. cant complain really. i think it has been worth the wait. glad its here. will be totting up some more hours of online fun. cant wait to see any new additions to the game, such as mods and any new content. for me, it scores a grand 9/10 with every game ever released. theres always room for a little more! :)",90.3

"this game had a few release day hiccups, but no where near as many as some games. the hiccups included some unpacking errors and some other bugs involving rockstars social club, however these are easily fixed or you just have to wait a ad longer to play the game. my initial impressions were; the graphics are amazing, lots of customizable options (key bindings, graphical settings ect), the game runs at a butery smooth 60 fps (even on a pentum cpu and a gtx 760 ftw) at mostly high - maximum settings. however i have experienced a few bugs, which prevented my car from moving, however this is the only bug i have encountered. pros; 1) graphics 2)runs on not to good hardware very well 3)60 fps 4)key bindings and lots of customization 5)high resolution and multi monitor support (4k - 3 monitors) cons; 1)release day hiccups (not a big deal) 2)a few bugs (not many though) so all in all this game is brilliant on the pc, i love it more than ever now and it looks amazing.",9.9

(yeah... right.) single players great for the hour i get before i crash due to rockstar signing me out for inactivity... multiplayer is brilliant if you have friends... public is ing terrible and should be avoided like the plague... another thing i hate is the bad rep system.. if you quit jobs early or act like an  they force you to play with other 12 year old  stains and you know the worst part about that? (it sounds awesome right? no) theworst part is the game crashes so ing much it punishes you by giving you bad rep... so pray you dont crash to desktop as 90% of players are doing online else youll have to play with the s and shall be branded an .. rockstar i dont appreciate being punished (and having my name i use in other games tarnished) from your own mistakes... fixthis  asap! buy this for simgle player only! i cannot recommend it right now but will be absolutely willing to reassess after a few more months.. and if you do buy it dont use your name from other games you  ;)",25.3

"i was scared that it wouldnt work, because i still cant get gta4 to play because of windows live errors. gta 5 makes you log in through social club but its not nearly as bad. i have all the recommended specs and then some. the game is beautiful. i have the game on ps3 but havent played it in so long that im ok with starting over. there are some new features - new cars, first person mode and online heists. i love 3rd person but 1st person feels extremely immersive, like youre in the city. i dont need to see the back of my characters head. also shooting controls are great with a mouse. no need for auto aim. driving is tough though. i do have a controller and its a lot better with that. to sum it up, the game runs great. nvidia came out with a driver last night, so i was good to go.",28.4

"gta5 is an open world game with a beautiful setting: a living and breathing city, the music, the npcs and behaviour. all that with stunning graphics. crisp and clear at 60 fps lots of gamemodes, from sp story mode, and freemode, and ofcourse online. so much to do, so much to see. you can rob stores, steal cars, race cars, kill people, rob banks, dive and fly, get street hookers in your car, visit nudie bars and look at . what more do you really want? really, after a lousy day at work there is nothing better then beating the  out of some people with a baseball bat in gta5. driving feels great, and for pc gamers the controls are so much better now. this is the best game ever made! 10/10!!",43.9

"+ im surprised how well this game runs on very high settings, single player and multiplayer. (gtx 670 overclocked) + lots of graphic setting options. + new soundtrack + hasnt crashed once + day one multiplayer is working + first person view is great - flying controls are little weird (maybe because i havent played gta on pc before)",8.8
"so imagine gta v on 360/ps3 was like the meal youve waited for all your life that tasted a little raw, but it was a good meal, yknow? then, youve got the ps4/one version that is the same meal cooked ever so slightly better, yet youre still hungry. this version is like, the real deal. the main entre. the dish youve been truly hungry for your whole life. and it may have taken a little longer for it to be done but you craved it even more. in the end, this is the most delicious meal of your life. you get everything and more, especially for those who can crank up to 11 (4k resolution, baby) even if youve bought this game before and thought youve done it all, dont overlook this well optimized glorious experience that will make your return to los santos ever so sweeter.",25.2
"a huge applause to rockstars customer service at lauch of gta v by giving everyone the opportunity to refund the game, whether they had several hours of game time or not, all because of a bug (which was not even a big deal to manually fix). first time to see a company offer refunds at day of launch. 10/10 would purchase from rockstar again.",4.8

"im very pleased with the port of this game, it runs well even on my -tier cpu. (fx-4100) the textures look great compared to the previous version i played on the last-generation consoles, even on the normal setting. the game has a very useful video memory gauge like the other rockstar ports which makes tweaking the options a cinch. i had no trouble transferring over my gta online character from the ps3 version, and the online so far hasnt given me any trouble in terms of connectivity. i did have some trouble with what seemed like mouse acceleration, and i was unable to find an option to disable it. but after changing from raw input to directinput it seems to be much better. all in all, id say it was worth the wait.",40.4

"ok if you have the gta launcher issue go on device managers, display adapters and disable your video card then it should run then enable the next time you start the game. now for the review its worth every penny. the gameplay is smooth, the game is great looking, havent tried online but ive heard very positive stuff about it and the game is just simply very very fun. if your pc can run this is a must buy",84.7
"holy  this game runs smooth and the graphics are amazing!",53.8
"gta v is finally released on pc, with much improvement from the previous gta iv release. it runs smooth 40-60fps even on my old hd6850. the same reaction when max payne 3 was released, why is this running smoothly on my old graphic card? rockstar has done a really good job on this. but still, 4 months of delay is pretty painful to wait.",45.4
"its okay. i expected much more. if you havent played it on any console before, buy it. if you have, i recommend you to not buy it. i played this on ps3 and ps4 as well, so i have some experience and knew how the game would be like. however, running at recommended specs (760 & fx-6630), i didnt find it to look any better than the ps4 version, other than the addition of 60 fps. and actually, some of the textures look worse than the ps4 version (this is at normal texture settings). definetely need a good desktop to run this at high settings, 1080p, 60 fps, and to make sure it looks better than the consoles. hopefully its just a bug on rockstars end, and might send out a patch to fix the graphics, but right now im not impressed.",18.9

"playing with a gtx 660ti with a little overclocking and 8 core cpu at ~3.8ghz game runs smooth as silk, defaulting to near max settings and havent had any frame drops or crashes so far. rockstar certainly put in the effort to optimize the game, i suspect those with problems will either be able to work around it with some yet to be discovered trick, or will be patched up later on by rockstar.",56.0

"the best installation and port to the pc by rockstar games since max payne 3. they have learned from their mistakes and given us something that works great right after launch. the game is highly optimized than its counterparts and offers a lot of choices in terms of graphics settings which will keep the average pc gamer busy. for new players, it is extremely important to go through all the graphics settings as a misconfigured option could ruin the whole experience. otherwise, the game runs very smoothly and the online feature has no flaws. the only downsides in my opinion is the requirement of linking your social club account before you can play, and of course the massive 60gb filesize. but we live in 2015, games are bound to get larger, and hard drives will also get larger as standard. other than that, you are guaranteed to have the time of your life.",23.4

"its gta v, one of the best selling games ever. i think we all know what we excpect from the pc port; glory! and oh my god is it glorious, after 2 years of watching console players enjoying the game, it is nice to play it at over 60fps, the way it should be.",43.2
"game runs really well although you need a decent cpu but nothing like the mess of gta 4 if you have been waiting out to see if this a crap port like 4 no need to wait anymore as they did a good job although not 100% bug free it pretty damn well given the state of most games at launch on pc",47.6
"we had to wait a long time to get the pc version, and so far it has worth it, the quality is amazing, im baffled that it runs so smoothly and well, the dev team really did a good job on the performance of the game. regarding gameplay the game is great, i love everything ive tried so far, shooting, driving, swimming (the undersea looks amazing), walking around, robbing and some more, i have yet to try flying and see what other surprises the game has, but even looking at the websites on the phone show the dedication put on this game. the story so far has got me hooked, the characters are great, each one with his unique personality and interesting relatives, theres little i can say because im barely starting the game (i didnt want to spoil myself all this years).",53.9
"after more than two yrs rockstar finally figures out how to press w to move forward.",40.1
"for 40 you get tons of content, main story missions, tons of side quests and just things to go see and do. the editor is just friggin amazing, if you not used it or even tried it its a must (other companies can learn from this no question). the online content is another game entirely that give you the opportunity to experience gta pvp (like only rockstar could), working co-op to pull of heists (this imho is the biggest seller for online) that are both challenging and rewarding, or go deathmatch, car racing even just shoot another player after you done a heist and take his/her loot as well (ah betrayal always good! no honor among thieves!). there is nothing more to be said really except its a must to have on your shelf or steam library & i look forward to mugging you every opportunity! ps - only negative point i can make is wish i could make a transfer of funds from game bank to my real life bank, come on rockstar share some of those billions with yer investors ^^",18.9
"*edit* turns out installing service pack 1 for windows 7 fixes the issue. (admittedly the system requirements do state that). as far as the pc port goes, this is very good. it runs better than gta iv does on my system and looks utterly georgeous. im running at 1080p 60fps on a mixture of high and medium with a gtx 760, which is very impressive.",39.1

"ive played the console versions of this game and it is fair to say that this is worth the wait. gameplay was great in both 3rd and 1st person mode (dont recommend first person if you have motion sickness), the cars didnt feel slippery, the campaign feels like sort of episodic (if i spelt that right) and the graphics were impressive. especially on the last gen versions of the game. 10/10 ps. be prepared to run into high level pr*cks going on a rampage in their tank on the online portion of the game",7.8

"this game is pretty good its beautiful and the graphics but there was a error that i came across gta 5 luancher has stopped working i havent fixed it",54.0
"worth the wait. everything works, and you have all the pc options you can ask for. should be possible to tweak to suit both low and high end pcs. it is also an amazing game, ive played it on both ps3 and ps4 before getting it on pc. you cant go wrong with this game. buy it!!",23.8
"the first person mode has really put this game on a whole new level. also lets not forgetting the following: -visually stunning.(4k resolution) -action packed. -brilliant story. -great humor. -massive world. -does a great job to progress the story in a non linear feel. -awesome soundtracks fitting any mood. (gotta love getting into a highspeed chase in a stolen car that just happenes to be playing something fitting to the scene) -hours upon hours of gameplay. -etc. downside: -requires a really powerful pc/laptop to truly appreciate its greatness. -may lead to psychosis ... lol",54.1

"ive tried all the fixes, even reinstalled still clicking play launches social club and stays at loading the entire time. no word from rockstar at all about this problem or any of the other one tons of the community is having. seems like rockstar is more concerned with partying now that the pc version is released instead of fixing any of the day 1 gamebreaking bugs tons of us are having. thanks rockstar. update: well finally over a day after i installed iit, a few hours after reinstalling(didnt need to) i finally found the fix to my problem, installing service pack 1 for windows 7. i looked and looked and didnt find this solution anywhere, and im sure this solution fixes the problem for others. its too bad rockstar isnt trying to get this information out to anyone anywhere. further review of actualy gameplay coming",85.7

"runs great on my computer (was built to game, but is getting older (i have a 7880 2gb, just above the recommended)), but i could get better preformance in this game. i have to play around with the graphics settings just a bit, but its fine for now. plays well with no crashes, even testing with a 360 controller (yeah, i played it on console, now cant use kb&m for this game because it doesnt feel right). the first person is pretty good, the extra music and car customization is pretty cool, and thank jeezooz there is an option for custom music again! so far, ive only played 1.1 hours, but i plan to find my graphics settings that i need and port over my old characters. and also play online. waaaaaaayyy too much online.",19.4

"gta v for pc brings great framerate, better graphics, and lots of problems for some gamers. you can tell by the reviews. most (if not almost all) negative reviews are people having trouble launching the game. the positive reviews are full of people loving the pc version of the game. so buying it is a minor risk of will you be able to log in without problems or get stuck troubleshooting. for the moment. afterwards i can see most reviews turning positive as they enjoy the first person mode with some amazing graphics.",10.0

"it seems a bunch of people have issues with getting this game to run. regardless of this my review will not be negative and i will try to help people out in this way: if you are a bullguard user, you might have the problem that your launcher will not start at all! this is what i did to fix this: open up bullguard and go to the general settings under settings. there will be an option there called selfprotection (allow bullguard to protect itself from termination, (or something similar) turn this off and reboot your computer, chances are great your launcher will now start normally! :d now for my actual review: have not played the game much, but i love the gta franchise and even though this game has had its fair share of problems on the pc i am still not gonna be negative about the games. the game looks great and what i have seen from other people playing and what i have played myself the game is loads of fun!! go get it!",23.5

"installing this piece of crap was a challenge. since launch ive had 3 random ingame crashes for no apparent reason. after this much development time they created the ultimate magnificent piece of crap that you can buy today for 59,99. i sincerely recommend gifting this game to your worst enemy.",22.9
"the first thing i did once i could free roam was: 1. switch to first person 2. sprint towards the nearest person. 3. kill that person by punching them very hard. 4. stealing their well earned money in illegitimate ways. 5. felt accomplished knowing that the guy i killed mightve been a murderer. 6. realised that im the real murderer. 7. got some food to celebrate. in short, 10/10, would have an existentialist moment again.",38.5

"this game is freaking awesome. i have it totally maxed out at 1920 x1080, at a steady 60. it has absolutely breathtaking visuals. it has been very friendly so far with crossfire 7970 lightnings. no issues at all. no flickering or other sli/crossfire common issues. it fired right up and worked great! i played about 10 minutes and was amazed, all the time after that was even better. first person view is so awesome. so much easier to drive. when i got to my safe house, moms house i am guessing, first thing i did was sit on the couch to watch the hilarious tv shows rockstar always puts on, my guy smoked a huge dank  jay, and started talking to himself. then i went to the gunshop and purchased a .45 automatic and a cqc submachine gun, there are a ton of mods, such as sound suppressors, optics, and all things that are good. next on my list is to bang some hookers and then get my money back with my .45 automatic. this game is sweet. 10/10 all around. graphics 10/10 gameplay 10/10 weed dankness 10/10 controls 10/10 (a lot to remember.) guns 10/10 physics 10/10",33.8
"prepare your  buckets and bagel bites... this game will consume every bit of time while youre on steam. from xbox 360 to xbox one, i played and beat them on both last and current gen. now that this definitive edition has released for us pc users, we can take in all the glory that makes gta v graphically stunning and its downright, addictive gameplay.",62.3

"word of warning. if you are transferring a character from an xbox 360 or ps3 account, make sure to log into gta v online on the console before transferring your character on pc! otherwise you will not transfer all your vehicles. i lost 10 custom cars and had to submit a ticket. this only works if you do it before the character transfer. in case anyone is wondering, you can transfer your character and still get your preorder money, so dont stress about it. other than that, this game is amazing, 10/10 lapdances!",32.3

"alot games dont really excite me these days - getting tired of poor physics and graphics. but gta v has been one of the most enjoyable games ive played in a while. personally tho, there is one con, theres no ads sensitivity setting. any game trying to pull off fps gameplay needs to know that fps players need the ads setting!",75.1

"i owned gtav for the xbox 360 and waited for the pc release to purchase it on a next gen system. it was well worth the wait. the graphics are simply amazing and first person view completely changes the game for me.",8.8
"i actually think this is a good game, unfortunately i cant play it on pc because the launcher keeps crashing rockstar, this is the second time this games launch went to , as thousands of others are having the same error as me. i will remove this review (if thats even possible) once rockstar fixes the damn issue. keep in mind i am writing this review 14 hours and 45 minutes after release",55.3
"ive been waiting for this game so long... and when it finally came out, i was not disappointed.",45.9
"ps4 version looks and runs better. it can feel nice for a bit at 60fps but frequent frame drops destroy the experience. there is also a very restrictive graphics options menu, as in you can change the options but the game will not let you play the game if it thinks you are out of memory. this can happen often as the game does not pick up on multiple graphics cards and large amounts of ram. a better port than gtaiv but its still not a high enough quality to warrant purchasing this version. only buy if you have a rig way above the reccomended settings and can afford a new hard drive because this is a resource hog and a disgusting large game to install. all in all the order for gta v goes ps4/xbone > pc >360/ ps3.",1.4
"it is just the best game i have ever played in my entired life! very well made! if the first person mode had the rear view mirrors with quality view at least for the driver i would call it 100%",27.4
"*pro tip, ignore the negative reviews that have 20+ hours of gameplay but their review states they are locked out of the game... by far the best game in the series. first person view mode is a great addition to an already fantastic game, crisp graphics and a video editor are just icing on the cake. story is good and improved from previous versions by having 3 main characters, all of which are introduced to eachother through some pretty funny circumstances. the multiplayer is top notch and considering it was a free update (from 360/ps3) its amazing rockstar has delivered as much as they did. heists improve the mp even further by giving you a team and multiple objectives to work towards a high payout. none of the previous gtaiv issues on pc are present and it really seems rockstar learned some valuable lessons from their previous release. i cant recommend this game enough.",21.4

"this is a great game that i would strongly recomend to anyone who loves just cause, other gta instalments or even open world adventure/action games. it has a vast array of activities or missions from killing cops to doing yoga (as featured in one of the many trailers). although it may be fun, the many activities are kind of a selling point for the game and generally they give way to the imfamous ultra-violence typical to gta. basically, some of the games are used only to boast of the games size and people maily will ignore them. i strongly recomend that you read and compare the system requirements due to the fact that it is a very demanding game and that playing gta 5 in 600x800 with half a second delay is, while semi-playable, extremly disapointing and worth nowhere near the cost of the game. i would deffinetly recomend the game to any casual or extreme gamer as it is an all-round fun time (+ we pc gamers get to laugh at the console players trying to aim on controller!!!).",0.3

"very nice game, played it on ps3 and still the same feeling. runs very smoothly, but the only bad thing is: the high cpu usage. i can change everything, but my cpu is always on 100%, still on low settings. and this causes no texture loading while driving, which is very bad.",74.9
"from the minute i started playing i have not been disappointed. this game, as far as my experience goes, has been full of nothing but elation. this game is nothing but amazing right now. i have experienced no issues so far (do note, i only played up to the first reposession mission and no side questing, your experience may vary) and framerates have been very smooth. the graphics, or should i say the game, is amazing for what i have in terms of hardware (gtx 770 2gb, i7 3770k, 16gb ram) and i recommend it wholeheartedly at this point and time.",60.5

"honestly the best version of gta5 so far and ive played on ps3 and ps4 hands down gta5 was meant to be for pc",11.1
"well rockstar, im not dissapointed one bit. i saw what i expected from gta v! the quality put into the game is worth all the money and more!",34.4
"played on ps3, and it was great. i couldnt wait to get my hands on this on pc and just play the way its meant to be. but... rough launch issues are killing the hype and happiness: 1) launcher crashes unless i disable my nvidia card from the device manager first. 2) game content takes too long to load, causing missing textures, models, animations, sounds. 3) can get 60fps on lowest graphics on this old laptop, but cpu usage is sawtooth and it fluctuates between 17fps and 60fps in about 2 seconds, and it keeps repeating this pattern, making the game more or less unplayable. 4) got a 16gb ssd, one of those first ones. game files are not grouped in a folder > i cant symlink the files > slow loading times. game aspects: great! technical aspects: not so much. do i recommend? if you have an ssd big enough to keep the entirety of the game, and a relatively good computer: yes. rockstar, please patch the game, i want to get my moneys worth.",60.8

"amazing port. i was really afraid of the port being similar to the one of gta iv in the beginning, but they took their time, which initially annoyed me a little, but in retrospect i must say it definetely paid off. the graphics are amazing and even with a medium-end computer rig, the game looks beautiful and runs at a stable 60 frames per second most of the time. there havent been any issues that ive run into so far and im praying that it will stay this way. all in all great game, great port and definetely worth the money! thank you, rockstar! perhaps i can get my girlfriend to get a copy and play with me ;)",22.6

"this game is amazing! the singleplayer is very dramatic/cinematic and has the feling of a movie about a group of thieves coming together to perform massive hiests. as for the multiplayer it feels like theyre trying to get you to buy shark cards as the online ultimatly feels like a huge grind but over all is still very fun and with the addition of hiests this gives the game a new feeling to it making players who have played the game for houndreds of hours to come back and play even more! so overall this game is worth buying the only thing i think needs changing is the grind in online. 11/10 ign 100% legit",24.9
"never had so much fun playing a male rottweiler banging another male dog (in one of franklins missions). onlines working well with all rookies laying around. graphics very optimised. still have stutter problems now and then. other than that......100/10 would always play this superior version.",52.3

"the game was very good ,i fall in love with it. im a chinese, so im so sorry about other chinese that talked there with bad words.",22.8
"i already own this on two consoles (ps3/ps4) and now the pc version looking as well. i am looking forward to modding the crap out of it. its a great game and i think people get turned off the online too easily. long load times, the occasional lag, and spotty server connection dont always help the argument either. it is easy to get frustrated especially early on when it looks like there are only a few activities and youre getting constantly stomped by people with better toys in the open world. dont give up, steal cars and rob mini-marts. buy guns or cars to do missions or race, then property. dont get lured away from the goal by the icing (clothing, haircuts, tattoos, custom paint and neon kits on starter cars). id rather be the worst dressed guy killing your faces any day. as you level up more and more activities will unlock and if you put in the time and find a good crew (you might as well it gives more point to run with a crew anyways) this game is beyond fun.",2.8

"where can i apply for a job in the rockstar team? two years of development and still they didnt even try to do a test run on some laptops, i think they have mighty fine siesta breaks at that company. oh well i guess the laptop players will have to wait 2 months more on a patch. sleep tight rockstar (for people with switchable graphical units i.o.w. intern graphical processor unit (cpu) + dedicated graphics card, dont invest money into this game yet. gta5 doesnt support this verry common laptop setup.)",1.4

"fantastic game. runs perfect using a 980 and 3570k @1440p. coming from the last gta i wasnt expecting this to be such a well made game. theyve done an awesome job, easily the best looking game, and yet its also huge! first person mode is great, and even then its got much better graphics than most corridor shooters. theres only two or three setting i cant quite max, but im running it at 2560x1440. ultra grass (which looks no different to very high as far as i can tell) and hd shadows (which is seperate from the main shadow option, has 15-20fps hit) but im running nvidia soft shadows which means the hd shadows dont do much anyway. online seems to be stable, but i havent played that much yet. very, very happy. great game, id highly recommend. dont let the last gta put you off (which is a mess still to this day) rockstar have spent a lot of time making the pc version. i also have the xboc one version, and pc blows that away.",63.8

"after having alot of time in multiplayer im updating this review. what i can say is this. right from the start you see this game is very optimized!! runs like a damn dream and looks amazing. i run the game on all high and very high with advanced settings on and fxaa no smaa at 1080p with 60-70+ fps. runs very smooth. the single player i havent played much of but from what i did play it runs as good there. but the maltiplayer is where i have been addicted! heist is just awesome and a challenge for you and your friends. having to plan out youre attacks. survival mod where you fight waves of enemies is like any other game. its fun though and a good challenge also. heist is just awesome and a challendge for you and your friends. having to plan out youre attacks. survival mod where you fight waves of enemies is like any other game. its fun though and a good challendge also. pvp is pretty fun especially in first person only matches. i can finally kick s in the face in first person! 10/10",39.4

"about freaking time! :d (i already finished the game... twice. but i am still so hyped to play it on pc!) ps. so far the game plays great!

"i was not going to buy this game. i really had my doubts. i installed and went right into online mode, knowing i would not get in. you can say, i expected to have wasted my money (i know, this is the last time i pay, pray, and play; hoping the game is as it states). boy was i wrong. this game is pretty damn grape. played a couple hours and not one issue. not one single issue. online is fun and customizing is addictive. having a blast so far. now to make some friends to play with...",6.3
"pc specs: 8gb ddr3 ram geforce gtx 770 amd a10-7850k (4c/8g) and i still have issues with this game. the map doesnt load as its supposed to do. i have set my graphics down as far as possible, even though i can play this at almost max, and the map still wont load when i drive a fast car. i dont know why this is happening, but its really annoying. heres my idea for a fix: make the game load the whole map before you get into the main game. or at least add a settings that allows you. those 10 extra minutes i can wait if my game doesnt just randomly stop responding and i have to wait like 3min just to take a single step so the map can load.",16.7
"firstly, you have to create rockstar social account and they dont allow dots or plus signs in the email address. secondly, trying to lunch the game shows grand theft auto v exited unexpectedly (...) error. what a piece of crap. waste of money.",42.1

"would not buy again. tempted to delete and request a refund. lost all enjoyment from this game after forced to torture a guy in by the book unskippable mission unskippable scene, pure torture porn and disgusting. writers try to tack on some anti-torture message after the fact, but the damage is done. the game forces you to engage in a torture simulation to progress, psychologically damaging. this game should be found obscene and banned.",33.9
"warning: for those with motion sickness issues. the game looks great! wish i could play it. seems like fun. i bought it .. played it for 30 mins or so.. got back motion sickness when when driving around. the way they did the camera work didnt agree with me. i turned off head-bopping in the menu, tried a bunch of other stuff. but it was still bad. i was able to get my purchase refunded from my account settings.",1.1
"looks way better than console version and 60fps makes buying this game again worth it.",39.6
"r* has out done themselves with this one, first person is done amazingly well, that to me third person feels weird but, it still has its usefulness while limited, the game can be played perfectly fine in first person without having to swap to third person. im running an r9 280(aka 7950 rebranded) heavy oc, an i5-4690k minor oc, and 8gb 1600mhz ram, 1080p is silk smooth on max settings, but 5760x1080 cant really get over 30fps but thats okay, since im only running one gpu, and im mostly using it for screenshotting the amazingness of gta v :) like most the player base, ive had an amazing experiance thus far and highly recommend this game to anyone.",41.0
"finally here... amazing graphics, maybe the best ones in the gta v, it is well optimized, super good and i recomend it! :d wow 60-70 fps, im running this game at high-very high settings at a resolution of 1920*1080, which it is a laptop and it runs it very smooth: i7-4710hq gtx 860m 2gb 8gb ram",19.3

"this game... even the newly released alpha early-access games are less buggy. after downloading the huge 60gb game, i had to first make a new windows user account only so i could run the game. when i finally could get the game to run i got stuck in a loading screen. i had to go and delete some files that were presumably in an infinite download-delete loop, when i deleted those the game was supposed to download the original files back and stop doing the infinite loop, but no. f*ckin s*it, the game didnt even want to start, so i had to torrent the files (about 5gb) back and put them in, yay now the game launches but still stuck in the  loading screen. so now after four hours of troubleshooting and trying to get the game past the first loading screen without any success, i am deeply dissappointed, dear rockstar, what the flying f*ck is this?",35.8
"game caused me frustration. updated gpu drivers, hit cancel, ran driver removal, had to reinstall os due to driver install not canceling and removal corrupting driver. then that night tried a system image restore, next day still not done....reinstalled os. everything updated finally got to play the game after going through the intro sequence 3 times, 10/10 would crash pc again!",65.5

"well, a got a bad luck and i think all this great dev should be more attencious about their games before their let it availible. i got a issue with the game launch and, yes, i did all the steps trying to fix something that i couldnt. to be more specific, my issues were: 1- i cant launch the first screen ( social club ), when i thought it would works it crash. 2- my serial was duplicated. 3- it was missing one .exe file on the folder and i couldnt execute it as admin. 4- i play on laptop and i read that almost every laptop users got problems with the game. therefore, my negative reviem is just because i couldnt got to play it and it was kind of frustrating to not be able to play with my other friends... now im the black sheep of my friends group (lol). for those who bought the game and it doesnt works as well, you can reclaim your money if you want. i did it and when the devs launch a fix i would buy it again.",0.3

"absolutley amazing..i had over 200 hours on xbox 360 online and i jump on pc and the game feels like its a completely different experience, the game looks amazing graphically and has been insanely optomized unlike other rockstar titles. there is endless fun things to do with friends online, 10/10 worth the second purchase for 60$ by far..i see atleast 1000+ hours of gameplay in my future.",22.0

"i have been waiting for this for forever. now that its out im having mixed feelings. its extremely fun and i love buying new clothes for my character. my biggest issue however is that the lowest graphic setting is 853 mb and my computer only has around 500 mb. they really need to release an update b/c i dont wanna see nothing but pixel splotches and i cant get my money back.",2.9
"it took a long time for gta v to make it to pc, and an even longer time to install it on my pc, but a few space-making steam game uninstalls later and i was back in los santos, and it holds up even better than my rose-tinted goggles could ever see. with the sheer amount of settings available, it feels like gta v was here on the platfrom all along, and i cant wait to see the mods. i gave it a 10/10 back on the ps3 nearly two years ago, and its only gotten better since.",31.0

"gtav plays excellently on the pc. the optimization is great, with mid-range computers being able to flawlessly play this game with little hassle. its a game that can be as beautiful as you want it to be, with a plethora of options to tweak. the controls work well with keyboard and controller. the awesome thing is that you can have the keyboard/mouse plugged in as well as a controller, and the game will detect which you are using and adjust the tooltips. the polish on this game is very apparent. the character migration also works well. what im trying to get at is everything about this game is everything from the xbox one/ps4, but better in every way. except helicopter control, which i feel is a little loose and more difficult, but still usable.",7.8

"the definitive gta:v experience which, for me, was the ultimate multi-player game of the last generation. granted, its been a bit of a wait for the pc crowd, and the online facet of the game is not without its glitches (abominable lag despite having a +100 mbps connection, jumping into a car and not being able to drive for some reason, weird vehicle damage modelling loops, just-killed enemies coming back to life due to disparity between local and server-side assets, etc.), but when you compare it to similar games in the genre, i still think its way ahead of the competition. yes, the delays should have meant a more stable launch, and i agree that the whole windows username thing, whilst not affecting me personally, is a pretty big oversight, but a quick patch or two later and it should all be rectified. then again, im one of the jerks whos been playing it on xb360 and ps4 for the last year and a half, so im probably a whole lot more forgiving than the average pc user. either way, its a 09/10 from me - now we just gotta wait for a pc remake/sequel to red dead redemption.",19.5

"after two years, the blockbusting grand theft auto v has finally arrived on pc. and now the question im sure everyone is asking: is it worth a buy? i can safely say this is one of the best optimizations of a pc game i have seen. even a gtx 860m, a the midrange laptop gpu in my comp, is able to churn up 60fps on high settings with little to no hitches. kudos to r* for delivering a fantastic product. note: now while the game itself runs beautifully, the installation issues were a royal pain. if steam ever crashes during the unpacking, or the social club client is unable to start the game: grand theft auto v has exited unexpectedly verify the game cache, it turned out that 10 files were missing so let that unpack. other than that great port 10/10",55.9

"very impressed. while i was not able to run the game at max settings, i was able to maximize the graphics to a point where they still exceed the graphics seen in the current generation consoles like the ps4. i am running an aging amd phenom ii x6 1100t (turbo core/coolnquiet disabled), 16gb of ddr3, and 2 asus gtx 760s in sli (4gb vram total)with the latest nvidia gta v approved drivers what i was impressed with the most is that the fact that this runs better than gtaiv... on the same hardware! rockstar did not screw this up, and has redeemed itself from that awful port that was gta iv. while it is disappointing to hear that many people with odd windows account names were unable to install and run the game, i feel as though a bug as that should not eclipse what a great game this turned out to be. graphics aside (but seriously... wow!) the game itself has not lost any of its luster gameplay-wise in the 2 years its been out. gta games just never get old. the game will have you hooked, its got me hooked on my third playthrough, and with mod support, expect the game to be even better than the console experience.",5.7

"while the graphics still need to be optimized and there are plenty of things that could be fixed at the moment, the pc release blew me out of the water. the graphics in this game are astounding, and everything is much better than on the consoles. the heists are great and really tie the game together. i honestly feel as if i have been playing a beta on the consoles, and this is the final release of the game. like i said though, there are many things that could be fixed. (*points* talking to you rockster!) with some minor tweaks, this game could be epic. i look forward to the expansion of the gta v mod community, because ever since gta iv, they have been waiting to mod a game of this magnitude. things that would make this game perfect! *manual transmission option *fuel system *working mirrors on cars (rearview and sidemirrors)",52.4
"ill make this quick, played gta since the very first top down one on pc. i played them all and loved them all like we all have. so when the time gta5 came out i was waiting to maybe get it on a next gen console, so i waited and didnt play it even though it was killing me. fast forward, i never bought a ps4 or xbox one because im pretty much 100% pc at this point. so i had to wait and wait, and then it gets delayed and delayed. so yesterday i finally got to play this on pc in all its glory and wow, runs amazing looks great and is the same great gta type of game i expected. if anyone is on the fence about this because it may not run well, i wouldnt worry about it rockstar nailed it on the optimization for pc. im completely happy with it and cant wait to spend 100+ hours running over pedestrians.",32.8
"my mom told me to get a life while i was playing gtaiv... i cried so hard and whacked my xbox apart--my little brother thought the whole building was coming down... but, hold on, finally, after 765 days wating... im able to get a life. gta is love, gta is life. 10/10",59.8

"excellent port, runs very smooth on my pc (except for the odd graphics driver crash which i expect will be fixed soon). i get around 55fps @ 1440p on my gtx 970 & i7 (4ghz no oc).",49.4
"i was so pissed when r* released the game for console and we still didnt know if it was coming to pc, or when. i have waited so long to play this game. i told myself i wouldnt pay full price because they made us pc gamers wait so long, but i ended up doing just that and you know what? it is worth every penny. what i like about it! (1) the game actually has a fairly interesting story. i find myself not skipping the cut scenes for the most part. (2) being able to switch between characters is really cool. (3) fps!! first person mode is really cool. i like being able to switch when i want (4) graphics. wow! the game looks so pretty on my 5820k/gtx980 combo. (5) smooth. the game feels so smooth at release -unlike watchdogs which is still a buggy mess. (6) the game will still provide hours of entertainment even after you finish it. conclusion. it was worth the wait. but, with all of the money they have made, they better hire some more people so that gta vi gets released on all platforms at the same time, like every other normal company does.",36.9
"runs at a consistent 60 fps with very high textures using my 4gb 770 gtx and an i7 4770k at 1080p. i was a little worried that the pc port would run poorly even on modern hardware like gta iv, but it seems to be very smooth considering it is a port. the settings claim to require 2300mb of vram so id imagine having a graphics card with only 2gb of vram wont be able to run this at max settings simply because of a vram bottleneck. invest in a 3gb+ graphics card or settle for slightly less than max settings. the game is beautiful at high resolution and high fps. this is a much better experience than my original playthrough on the xbox 360 when it was first released.",38.4
"lov this game. worht the year wait lol installed right away played right away. so far its an amazing game with no bugs. how often does a pc game come out thats actually optimized for pc these days. never. but his one is. only con is its 60gb lol but not really a con just took forever to download.",37.6

"hi gamers, i heard that some people have problems launching the game on windows laptops, here is the workaround i used. 1) - open device manager by clicking on the start button and typing in device manager and pushing the enter button. 2) - find the tab display adapters and then right-click on your main graphics card (for me nvidia geforce gt 555m) and click disable. 3) - start the game and wait for social club to showup and wait like 5 secs 4) - repeat step 2 but instead of clicking disable now click enable 5) - the game should now start after social club is done doing its thing. hope you have a great time playing gtav!",15.6

"gta 5 as an exercise in world building and story is amazing, the world feels alive, deep and most importantly fun. the 3 main characters are varied enough to keep things from becoming stale, and being able to specialize them, through semi rpg elements and purchases is a nice touch. as far as gameplay related bugs go i encountered just one in 12 hours (unable to progress through mission). however the game makes us of often auto saves and allows quick saving so this was not a massive issue due to being able to load previous save. in terms of a the quality of the pc port i have several woes, firstly installing on a samsung ssd caused memory issues and made the game unplayable, secondly crossfire scaling is not as good as i hoped. despite this a great set of graphical options offered allowing intricate customization. overall very happy with the game",24.6

"at first i was very sceptical, especially because i have seen the flaws of this game on the xbox 360. the issue with that game on that console, was that you could glitch your money in many different ways by using 2 online players, and the pay & spray shop. you could also gate glitch, and get underneath the red parking lot building, and if you had a fast enough car, you could even make a jump towards the metro, underneath los santos. most of these glitches i have tested if they still work, and from what i have gathered and tried, its 9/10 made impossible. along with the graphical update, the first person view, and for how you can transfer your gta console character to the pc makes everything just perfect as it should. i espect many hours that i will spend inside this game, all under the form of total freedom that we all care so much about. the only thing i really dislike about gta, is that they have taken so much time, untill the pc port was finally there.. for future games, this should really be quicker, prostponing will make gamers angry, and nothing positive comes out from that. i give this game a 9/10.",66.9

"i played gta v/online on console and aside from a rocky start with updates and bugs and connectivity issues, the game played great. i loved the easter eggs, i enjoyed the off-line story mode. and the online mode was great, even as a vanilla game with no dlc or updates the game had so much to do: racing, darts, tennis?, golf, parachuting, base jumping, deep sea diving, the list goes on. i felt the graphics for this game were about par as far as gta games go, they slowly keep pace with the times, the graphics werent mind blowing, but they were very decent. as far as support goes, rockstar is currently reviewing a ticket i submitted regarding a few bugs, and things seem to be moving in a positive direction. do not rate games on their glitches and bugs, rate the game. and i give this game a very good rating. now if the bugs and glitches are not fixed, my rating will unfortunately change, as i am rating this game under the assumption that those bugs will be fixed sooner rather than later.",19.1

"i remember the day when my friends told me id never experience gta 5 on the pc when it first released, i kept my comments to myself, knowing that when gta iv released it took them 9 months for it to come over to the pc. 2 years later i pre-odered the game, hoping and praying this game wouldnt turn out terrible....and to my surprises, with some of the launch problems, and rubber banding during online play, rockstar really did make this game one of my favorite games of all times. it runs flawless on my gaming pc, it isnt a beastly rig, has medium specs to it, but damn even with all my graphics set to normal/high, the game runs 40-50 fps in cities, and over 60 in the mountains and blaine county. online is funny as hell, playing with friends is amazing, running from the cops, to holding up store clerks for money, to heists, they really have made the best version of gta 5 possible. if you already havent purchased this game, open your wallets and buy it now. if you asked for a refund, buy the game again. this is the best game of the year for me, and i will be playing it years from now with friends, and i promise you its worth every minute, hour, and dime you put into it.",57.8

"welp, its brilliant. its gta v, excellently ported, running smooth as silk on pc. plenty of scalable options, no issues at all. not much else to be said. this game is a stunning technical achievement and an instant classic.",28.6
"1010 great game just love this i didnt play in the console so i having realy fun time in the single and in the online thats all i need to say to describe this awsome game was worth the time of the delay",48.6
"a cop killed my black character without any reason. its so realistic!!! 11/10 would buy again",11.6
"i have been waiting for this forever and when they released it, i was very upset, my game has fps lag problems, i have the minimum requirements and i get around 25-30 fps, i can handle 30 but it keeps dropping under and it get very annoying. please release an update with more optimizations to the game to make my fps to go up",26.8
"man, first person takes this game to another level. at first i thought it was poorly optimized, and have the rig to run it great. i soon learned all you have to do if you get stuttering, is alt+tab out and click icon back in. this has fixed all stuttering without lowering graphics options at all. gta v is a lot of fun, and was well worth the wait. 3 characters to control is a nice switch-up. good variation of missions. this game on pc looks way better, and runs smoother than the consoles. i would recommend this game to anyone who wants to take a hiatus from life for a bit heh heh. recommended!!",66.4
"love everything about this game! i remember playing gta2 and wondering how it would be in 3d. thought it was never possible. gta3 came out and proved to be everything and so much more. playing gta5 brings me back to the old days and pushes me forward into planning heists and fighting mind controlling aliens. loving every bit of it. thankyou rockstar!",29.4
"runs very nicely. online is all i care about so i dont know about single player. only issue is the servers keep dropping people.",76.8
"10/10 absolutely beautiful. honestly, super optimized. im running on all normal and i have an i5 4210u, 840m, and 8gb of ram. the game size is double so i can see people being angry but what do you expect. i preloaded it but didnt have to decrypt or unpack or anything.",45.5
"the game runs smoothly and so well optimized, i have an average rig but i can play it on very high setting with 50+fps. r* done well to deliver best experience to gamers. imagine san andreas with fluid environment, interesting characters, amazing details and outrageous gameplay. what else matters? its gta v !! by the way, i sacrificed my masters degree for this game...10/10",91.6
"surprisngly this game handles pretty well, even if you run it on low without updating your drivers. this game is far from a bad port, big improvement form gta iv.",46.7
"so far game keeps crashing, cant even get to the main menu.",12.0
"first impressions: played gtav on 360 and ps4. installation was a breeze, only minor tweaks for optimization running on a mid-tier pc. 1080p = ultra ultra ultra (looks great and super high framerates) 2k = ultra ultra ultra (looks even better and well above 60 fps) 4k = ultra very high ultra very high (looks so gorgeous with draw distance cranked up, butter smooth 60 fps) the game is gta...either love it or hate it. pc version is already 100x better than console with mods yet to come. i recommend the game only if you like gta.",17.7
"if you have an ssd and meet the system requirements then i would suggest this game highly. it runs like a beut on my 780 ti. this game is no port mind you, there are so many new things ive seen within the world from the consoles that it blows me away. even if you havent played the earlier gta games you will still love this immersive experience that it provides.",72.9
"this game doesnt work and they have been working on it for 2 years!! and delayed it 4 times. worse launch than halo mcc,and other games,nice one rockstar.",3.2
"after about 2 years, a 3 1/2 month wait, and 3 delays i can finally say that this game looks visually stunning.",16.4
"ive played it on both consoles, and now on pc. to me, this game just keeps on being fun and the graphical improvements on pc are pretty stunning! if you havent played this on consoles, this is definitely a must-have and totally worth the money.",23.6
"after playing it on 360, i can say hands down this is the ultimate version.. i have my graphics about midway and its still beautiful, being able to go first person is a complete game changer. stealing cars in first person = awesome",17.2
"some cant run it (me) others can at least roman isnt in this game..... yet",40.9
"first play of gta online, spawned in the middle of nowhere. got on first-person felt like skyrim and was shocked in awe by the scenery!! 11/10",27.1
"for those who have a problem with unpacking. in my case i have a 120 gb ssd... (formatted, no os) that not enough for this game unpacking. first, let it unpack until it pop up and error. then looking for an unpacked file in download folder. select some unpacked files and move it to another drive (in my case im moving sfx folder that worth around 16 gb) when it moved, try unpacking again. it will begin on where your left off. when unpacking finished it will back to 60 something gb. move folder back to common/[game folder]/[wherever it will be in the first place] this will be a little tricky cause it may not in a same position before you move it from download folder. doing file check... let it download if necessary. work and play! : ) *if you have more space please do some backup before, just for sure. for a game and 10 minutes in it... 20/10 : )",84.6
"holy  this game runs smooth and the graphics are amazing!",53.8
"ok if you have the gta launcher issue go on device managers, display adapters and disable your video card then it should run then enable the next time you start the game. now for the review its worth every penny. the gameplay is smooth, the game is great looking, havent tried online but ive heard very positive stuff about it and the game is just simply very very fun. if your pc can run this is a must buy",84.7
"this game is truly a masterpiece, one of my most favourite games of all time. buy it. now.",49.1
"just excellent! i didnt suppose that this game will run on my pc, because it is a normal thing nowadays when minimum requirements for the game are just meaningless - there is a very little chance that it will at least launch. however, i was very impressed when i saw a nice optimization - stable 30-50 fps in fact, that every spec of my pc is just as the same as the minimum requirement (i5-2320 3.0 ghz, gtx 550ti, 4 gb ram). the game itself is the best thing ever done for the whole gaming industry - not more not less. rockstar did its job well. 10/10.",39.9
"+ im surprised how well this game runs on very high settings, single player and multiplayer. (gtx 670 overclocked) + lots of graphic setting options. + new soundtrack + hasnt crashed once + day one multiplayer is working + first person view is great - flying controls are little weird (maybe because i havent played gta on pc before)",9.6
"so imagine gta v on 360/ps3 was like the meal youve waited for all your life that tasted a little raw, but it was a good meal, yknow? then, youve got the ps4/one version that is the same meal cooked ever so slightly better, yet youre still hungry. this version is like, the real deal. the main entre. the dish youve been truly hungry for your whole life. and it may have taken a little longer for it to be done but you craved it even more. in the end, this is the most delicious meal of your life. you get everything and more, especially for those who can crank up to 11 (4k resolution, baby) even if youve bought this game before and thought youve done it all, dont overlook this well optimized glorious experience that will make your return to los santos ever so sweeter.",25.2
"gta v is finally released on pc, with much improvement from the previous gta iv release. it runs smooth 40-60fps even on my old hd6850. the same reaction when max payne 3 was released, why is this running smoothly on my old graphic card? rockstar has done a really good job on this. but still, 4 months of delay is pretty painful to wait.",45.9
"a new and fresh experience with gta v with update graphics and all the other content arrived in one big bundle. no need to wait for gta online, no need to wait for hesists, all the things that were on the console is on pc as well. sure, it took a couple years for it to be released, but hey, at least they released it. optimization is pretty good from the system requirements, but with my 970 graphics card, everything on max still had some jumps on the fps. nothing too major, and nothing a couple of patches cant fix. overall, this game looks amazing, and if anybody has played on last generation console like me, you would appreciate the mesmerizing graphics.",20.3
"amazing game, amazing graphics. but your going to need a pretty good pc to run the game on any setting. reccomend an intel proccesor and a geforce 900 series graphics card.",43.8
"worth 60 euros or dollars ? hell yes !!!!!! finaly we will se a game that beats dota 2 and counter strike globall ofennsive on steam top list :)",68.3
"after a long wait, its finally here! gta v is on pc. this game is one of the most optimised games i have ever played. the multiplayer part of this game is actually working day one, unlike the console versions. had absolutely no problem for more than three hours of gameplay. there are some negative reviews, which are extremely  and they do not reflect the actual game. some people had problems, some people did not have. you can expect such things if you are going to play the game immediately after it was released. hopefully, they will change their negative review into a positive one after they see the beauty of this game.",86.4
"biggest disappointment a gamer can experience, the failed release of a great game. especially since they had months to prevent this exact thing from occuring.",82.5
"got three stars for robbing a convience store and continued to be chased by a helicopter while i was on foot. 10/10 excessive force",32.6
"after about 3 hours of playing i can definitely recommend this game to anyone. it has been a long wait but this game is worth the money. one of the best additions to the pc version is the director mode and the 60fps boost. director mode will be a unique tool to use once everyone gets the hang of it but it is still really cool. playing with a mouse and keyboard seems a little awkward at first but you can get used to it. i personally feel like after playing this game that this game was made for pc as it is extremely superior to every other version. so finally i give a rating of 8/8 buy dis game yo.",47.7
"well the wait is finally over pc users, after being treated like second class citizens gta v fianlly came out. this is a franchise that you either love or hate, nothing here reinvents the wheel but this game is absolutely stunning and as fun as any of the other gta titles. a plus for me was a channel playing old punk rock with keith morris (black flag,circle jerks/off!) as the dj solid game woth the purchase, i just wish the wait for release was not so damn long.",8.3
"excellent game. i originally thought that the pc version is going to have some graphical issues but in the 2-3 hous ive played it so far i can say that it completely eclipses gta iv in every way.",55.8

"they finally cared. now gta 5 is without a doubt, the best gta so far, but its still tied down by the social club, and games for windows live, but it works so much better than gta 4, im using the same system, i can run everything on high in gta 5 with minimal lag, gta 4, i still can drive without being 2 seconds behind. controller support works great, and it feels like when i was playing on the ps4, it has the very rare stutter,but its pretty much perfect for me p.s. never have to bowl with roman or be a yokel or say push me push me again, goodbye 4, hello 5",31.1

"i load it up and then my social club crashes...fix please",5.6
"as soon as i got in game i set everything to lowest details to simulate the feeling of going from ps3 to pc when i changed the graphics to high. to my dismay the game looked better on all low graphics than the ps3 and i was robbed of my experience. worse than that i was given 1.5 million dollars and my old character from the console version and the ability to earn and claw my way to the top was brutally stripped from me. the first person mode is so emersive that flying makes me sick, the ability to record is taking up space on my hard drive, and dont even get me started on my infuriating and uncanny ability to aim with precision now that i can use mouse and keyboard. its made the game far to convenient. 10/10 would waste 2 years of my life and drain my daughters college fund again.",64.3

"i was buying snacks when a hipster and a furry came in and robbed the store, pulled me into a firefight with the cops, forced me to get into their van, hijack a plane and crash it on a strippers club while they cried allahu akbar! so one could say it was and average day.",64.9
"a masterpiece. honestly one of the greatest video games ever made. near-infinite replay value, great story, excellent pc port. 10/10",62.8

"you must install correct drivers in order to even start. the game already has glitches, you cannot push esc or it will auto close down and try to reboot in safe mode. secondly when you go to take covor the game will freeze and you cant move to covor, the bots will just stand there doing nuthing. i bought this game to add to my collection soon to be all gtas...i do not reccomend buying this outrageous expensive game, sold my gut knife on csgo for this....",8.9

"me personally had no issues at all, not even with social club, just saying.. the game runs at 60 fps all the time on high/very high settings on my i5-4670k + gtx 760 2gb. i played it on the xbox 360 and i dont have to tell you that it is a big improvement. i cant recommend this game enough, especially if youve never played it before!",79.4
"just... just buy it, trust me. this is not just a port, this is more. the game is beautiful and the hype is not fake. you must know one thing - 2gb graphics card, is enough, now let me define enough: some features (graphical ones ofc) require a lot of graphics cards memory, and for beautiful game, without huge fps drops, crashing, etc. you will need more than 2gb :) every penny that you give in this game, if worth it!",71.6
"been stucked in the game luncher loading process for literally an hour and nothing happened. i tried to restart steam, change compatibility, restart computer and basically anything i could think of, but still couldnt solve the problem. im quite disappointed by this weird bug, i dont care about in-game bugs because i know its not easy to solve every single one of them at launch, but i think players should at least be able to play the game, right?",36.3
"runs great on my computer (was built to game, but is getting older (i have a 7880 2gb, just above the recommended)), but i could get better preformance in this game. i have to play around with the graphics settings just a bit, but its fine for now. plays well with no crashes, even testing with a 360 controller (yeah, i played it on console, now cant use kb&m for this game because it doesnt feel right). the first person is pretty good, the extra music and car customization is pretty cool, and thank jeezooz there is an option for custom music again! so far, ive only played 1.1 hours, but i plan to find my graphics settings that i need and port over my old characters. and also play online. waaaaaaayyy too much online.",19.4

"the road textures 5 - 15 feet in front of my car are litterally worse than xbox 360 graphics(reguardless of graphcs settings). im running a gtx 770, and this should not be the case. plus, there are thousands of little things wrong with this game, like the first person weapon fov, the weapon animations, and the way you hold the gun. things like controlling the car with the mouse is out of the question, because the camera always wants to look at the god damn skyline, and i cant change that. it is literally so ing annoying that i choose to stick with mouse camera control, and crash into  rather than control my car. there are so many other problems other than the ones ive stated here. i would have to write a 5 page article to explain all of them. this  needs to be fixed, rockstar. your game is currently in its final beta test, and still has a long way to go. and for that, i hate you and the game. thanks for the unfinished product. i will never pre-order one of your games again, and neither should other people reading this review.",32.0

"i would like to tell you all my experience of gta v so far. had to delete half my steam games to fit it/uncompress it. when you open it with dxtory (one of the most popular recording softwares) it crashes every single time - so i have no idea of my framerate in game. i just got stuck in a glitch, the game was running a benchmark, and then the first mission started, forcing me to constantly fail the first mission as it glitched across the map to run the benchmark. 10/10 would buy again. i expected more from you rockstar",58.3

"so its been about 7 hours since gta was finally ready to play. a year and a half could not have prepared my eyes (and my mind) from the visual onslaught brought on by the high resolution textures of gta in the very high settings. the amount of detail that was put into every aspect of the visuals is impeccable, from the high detail of car headlights to the boob wobble when you shoot a woman in a bikini with a beretta for looking at you funny. once you adjust to the detail you realize that the game seems to be set in overdrive mode, almost seems like its being fast forwarded. thats because its at 60fps, where our eyes have been used to seeing the game run at a near constant 30fps, to see it doubled is amazing. its is truly the ultimate version, better than both console generations combined.",2.8

"10/10 this game is amazing, this pc port is worth every penny i spend on it. i see a lot of negative reviews here and i really dont get why. the performance is amazing, it runs many times better then gta4 did and it looks astonishing. after playing only a few hours i must admit that rocktstar did a really good job, on the graphics and the optimization. it may have been delayed a couple of times, the end result is worth all the waiting. sure there are a couple of people with problems performance wise and the online servers are crowded right now, but this will all pass in the coming weeks. you know the story, the gameplay etc. but most people want to know how this game runs on the pc, and so far it runs excellent, better then any tripple a title i have seen in the last couple of months. i could write a long story on how amazing this game is but i really want to play more at this point:) thank you rockstar for making this game the experience i could have only dreamed for on the pc. maybe at some point in the future i will include more info here, for now all i can say is: i recommend this game more then most other games for this price tag, you are missing out on a amazing adventure otherwise.",53.1

"this game had a few release day hiccups, but no where near as many as some games. the hiccups included some unpacking errors and some other bugs involving rockstars social club, however these are easily fixed or you just have to wait a ad longer to play the game. my initial impressions were; the graphics are amazing, lots of customizable options (key bindings, graphical settings ect), the game runs at a butery smooth 60 fps (even on a pentum cpu and a gtx 760 ftw) at mostly high - maximum settings. however i have experienced a few bugs, which prevented my car from moving, however this is the only bug i have encountered. pros; 1) graphics 2)runs on not to good hardware very well 3)60 fps 4)key bindings and lots of customization 5)high resolution and multi monitor support (4k - 3 monitors) cons; 1)release day hiccups (not a big deal) 2)a few bugs (not many though) so all in all this game is brilliant on the pc, i love it more than ever now and it looks amazing.",9.9

"the game itself is great. i expected to be able to at least run it on minimum settings and for the most part its reasonable. still looks better than console with shadows being the only issue. the glitches and speed of launch/ loading will probably be fixed soon. it does freeze up a bit luanching the game but i just get a snack and its loaded when i come back, probably 2 minutes at most. gameplay is fantastic, i love the story (never bothered getting it for console) and there are so many interesting things to do in the game world. if you are very impatient and expect a lot from your setup, maybe wait a few weeks for the glitches to pass. but if you can handle a bit of lag, a few glitches, and dont care too much about flawless performance, definitely buy this ultimate edition of gta 5",57.5

"in this review i will be reviewing this version of the game as it stacks up to the other versions. graphically its outstanding, you cant really get any better on the console versions. too bad for a large percent of users the port is riddled with problems (like the one where you cant load jobs online without your game crashing) i am finding it hard to recommend this game in its current state, since it seems to be a flip of the coin wether or not it will actually run consistently without crashing.",47.5

"what in the actual , rockstar?? i kind of expected to be able to play a game i paid for, on the day it is supposed to be playable. i, like so many others out there, have had to scour the depths of google just to figure out how to just get the game to launch. i really love the gta series and had great expectations for this release, but have been thoroughly let down. please fix what needs fixing so we can all get along again.",7.8

"great job rockstar, you managed to completely disappoint me. the endless delays were meant to be to polish the game right? well done. the game is so much polished that i cannot even get past the ing launcher. i have tried so many fixes that people have released, from disabling the graphics to reinstalling the game. i was in midst of formatting the pc completely, then realised that no game should be this hard to play, and worth formatting my entire system. so good job, rockstar, i am not going to be thrilled about your next step, if there will be one. even if the patch will be released, and game becomes stable or whatsoever, that will not change my attitude towards your company. you just dont deliver, plain and simple. yeah the game might be good or not, that will depend on my experience, if i manage to get one.",38.1

"so i just installed gta 5 to my laptop (ihave nvidia 870m), after i opened up the game the right bottom bubble said gta5.exe has been blocked from graphic hardware and the game stopped working. i opened geforce experience to look for an update or something, but the app said the driver was unknown, it couldnt find the driver. after i restarted my computer it gave a blue screen report that says video_tdr_failure (nvlddmkm.sys) and when i opened up geforce experience again it couldnt not find any hardware. i tried to install the driver again but the installation program couldnt find the hardware either. i believe the problem is the new release of gta 5. also my gpu tweak program says the laptop is currently using intel graphics. after all these happened i contacted you and you told me that you should contact with the manufacturer. and i did that too and got my geforce experience fixed. this time when i open up the game my laptop shutted itself down 3 times. then i optimized the game from geforce experience. then it gave the blue screen again and there is no hardware detected again. i can fix it again but i dont think i can play the game again to not get the same crash.",18.8

"absolutely amazing. nothing bad to say about the game itself, other than the fact that when i first started playing it driving around in the cars started to drop my framerate horribly from straight up 60, down to 5 or lower which really made me mad, but a couple of restarts of the game later bam its fine. 11/9",44.9

"i know there are a lot of people struggling with some bugs and i fully acknowledge how frustrating it must be having waiting so long after the console release, then preorder, then preload, and then crashes. you have my condolences. when i loaded the game, there were a number of nagging issues.. such as the benchmark utility being worthless since it starts the game while running the benchmark. i have no clue how they could have missed this. moving on, i played last night after finding the appropriate graphical settings. the game is beautiful. when you are considerate to your settings, the framerates are silk. i sat downtown and just watched things, i havent done that in a game since skyrim. its something to see... this is one of those games that will sell a ton of hardware. this and witcher 3 have made it an exciting quarter for pc gamers. paying $59 for a game i played on ps3 was a hard pill to swallow, but it was worth it.",28.9
"good but you need atleast 3.5 ghz intel core i5 to play",51.3
"despite the plenty negative reviews on gta v, i honestly think that those who did post a negative review were just dissappointed that they werent able to play as soon as it was released. sure there were some problems that many people encountered, but with a game this big, problems are bound to come and go. i havent encountered too many problems and so far the game is beautiful. ive played on the ps3 and the pc version is so much more detailed and thoughtful. there are things that boggle me still to this day. best game to play with friends, and overall you dont need to think twice on buying this game, the problems will ultimately be fixed as rockstar do not want their reputation and expectations to drop.",42.2

"great game right from the start, i liked the other gtas but that is the best one. i will tell you it bad side, rockstar sucks at support, ea at list have live support and i need to wait a month so i could submit a bug report, what brings me to wonder around there site for bug report. the bug is not importent for the moment. im also disapointed that you cant change the level of the first person view. but the game still worth the money, great buy.",35.3
"you can smack people with the wing of a plane 10/10",15.5
"brilliant graphics, gameplay, storyline, and multiplayer. also incredibly well optimized for pc. there are a few issues with the game (namely stutters, buildings not rendering sometimes) but they dont seem to happen to everyone. and for the first version of the game its understandable. other than those issues, absolutely awesome game and enjoying it a lot! been doing multiplayer mostly, and its a lot of fun. cheers for another awesome game r*",36.9

"you can see that r* really worked hard on this, they didnt just port the game.",7.0
"overall this was one of the better ports that has come out in the last year. unlike a lot of games, it has been optimized really well and im able to play on high/very high with a gtx 660 and get around 50-60 fps. the only bug ive had is that the screen freezes up sometimes after restarting a heist and this can easily be fixed by changing something in the video settings and changing it back.",26.8

"im so glad that i paid $60 for a game that delayed for significant of time to ensure its was polished for the pc. it wont even start. i get an error saying the game existed unexpectedly every time the rockstar social club launcher is loading. was this game beta tested at all during the year it was delayed? doesnt look like it. no official response from rockstar - not even to acknowledge the problem and reassure its customers that it will have a fix soon. only video game producers can get away with selling broken/unfinished products as finished products. these folks wonder why no one wants to pay for their games.",31.9

"rockstar failed us again! just like gta iv! there are so many issues with this game. from textures not loading correctly, low fps count, settings dont save after changing them, etc. the list goes on and on and we are stuck here with a game that we all wanted to play on day one of release. thanks rockstar for keeping your promise we have worked hard on this release.",31.4
"the game is worth dying for , haha, just joking.. :d , but the game really interesting, it runs smoothly the graphic is so nice that i can run it at the maxed out graphic..last but not least, i enjoy it so much. the story was great and funny in most of it =) make me keep following it. also the world look nice and beautiful, a lot of activities to do and a lot of thing that waiting us to find out ;) not a single problem i found. everything went fine for me. i loved and enjoy all of it.",4.3
"works fine for me. on lowest settings to maintain decent fps for my toaster, still looking pretty good.",39.6
"on my first day of playing gta v, i realized this game is about freedom to do whatever you want. after completing 1,2 missions, i decided to hit the golf course at about 10:30 pm. a sharp pain in my right eye broke my concentration and ive messed up the shot. alas, when i looked upon the cellphone clock, it was 4:30 am and my eyes were bleeding. but i honestly cant remember when i had so much fun in life, and i have a pretty cool life too, cant complain. the thing is, there is so much to do, so much to see, im guessing its gonna take me 100+ hours to see it all. every ride reveals beautiful, realistic eye candy that just puts a smile. dont believe me? grab a chopper or a plane and gain some altitude, then look down on the city. it feels so alive, every car driving with a purpose, every pedestrian doing his own thing. this is so much more than a video game, its the video game. its a life simulator that it sadly, way more fun than real life. p.s. one of the best optimised games for pc ever. looks and plays wonderful. i have to sleep now, or ill die.",61.3
"i got gta5 for ps3 and now for pc as well. i say it worth it. the graphics are much better and aiming with a mouse is like a dream coming true. by the way dont forget the mods that should be coming for pc.",40.8
"the best just got better! one of the most iconic games to ever exist.",55.5
"the definitive gta:v experience which, for me, was the ultimate multi-player game of the last generation. granted, its been a bit of a wait for the pc crowd, and the online facet of the game is not without its glitches (abominable lag despite having a +100 mbps connection, jumping into a car and not being able to drive for some reason, weird vehicle damage modelling loops, just-killed enemies coming back to life due to disparity between local and server-side assets, etc.), but when you compare it to similar games in the genre, i still think its way ahead of the competition. yes, the delays should have meant a more stable launch, and i agree that the whole windows username thing, whilst not affecting me personally, is a pretty big oversight, but a quick patch or two later and it should all be rectified. then again, im one of the jerks whos been playing it on xb360 and ps4 for the last year and a half, so im probably a whole lot more forgiving than the average pc user. either way, its a 09/10 from me - now we just gotta wait for a pc remake/sequel to red dead redemption.",19.5
"i heard that a game was here somewhere. i must of bought the loading screen edition instead... but i can confirm, got some hours of beautiful loading screen footage. by the way, why is this early access game not labeled as early access?",5.4
"took quite a while to download but totally worth it!!!!",24.7
"as of writing have only played a few hours of online but i am already very impressed. playing with friends is a blast. i anticipate many good times to be had with this game, glad it finally came to pc with the improvements from xb1/ps4. controlling vehicles with keys took getting used to for me but keybinding and/or a gamepad can fix that. other than that, no gripes. exemplary port.",4.9
"if you dont already have it buy it, if you already have it play it.",73.2
"this game was really fun on xbox and im sure its even more fun on pc and id live to play if it wasnt for the fact that i cant stay in game for more then 15 minutes. they game crashes way too much for what it is, its benn delayed and has a large team that should know what they are doing. ive looked everywhere and i cant find one solution that works or anything from rockstar saying they are working on it or even that they know that the game is crashing for so many people. i payed for a game this big it shouldnt be crashing this much. ive seen early access games made by a single person that crash less then this.",64.2

"really well optimized, compared to gta iv, the graphics are amazing, even in the lowest settings, the shadows are unbeliavable, tottaly soft and without pixels. the only bad thing is the lot of problems that came on the launch day. lots of people trying to download, install, open, but without success. i had to deactivate my nvidia gt 630m and use the intel hd graphics 4000 to launch the game, then activate the offboard gpu to run it, because the launcher crashes at every try. worth the money and the wait, but me and tons of people are still waiting for those compatibility fixes. 8/10",19.0
"amazing game; once you get it running. i do wish it didnt use social-club. and i wish it didnt take so much trial and error to get it installed the rockstar hot-fix didnt work. but the graphics are absolutely amazing, and this is one ofthe best ports i have seen so far, despite one or two fall through the world type things. what i did to fix the downloads is just disable short-cuts and windows start menu short-cuts and then you should be good, the thing is you just have to open it through steam.",35.2

"yes, i would recommend this game. a couple things first. (i can only vouch for amd) the game is not optimized for pc yet. it crashes randomly, i get ballz fps drop when driving, flying, ect (i have an amd 6970 in crossfire. thats 4gb video memory) around 30-45 fps, and the graphics option and advanced graphics options dont really give that much. it needs more options and locations on how to change this. i cant even edit it manualy through the file browser in windows where its installed. i love the cut scenes and story mode but if the game isnt optimized i cant even play it! rockstar please fix this. i know its all softwear sided. many pc gamers have been waiting forever, including me, for this game to come out and the least you could do is make it run smooth.",63.4
"so i previously wrote a negative review; that was until i figured out how to actually get the game to start with the disable nvidia driver trick. i will now follow with a full, proper, in-depth review of this game: its gta v. nuff said.",47.6
"really rockstar after pre order and 3 delay what i get is a error grand theft auto 5 has stopped working and your supporter does mot care to answer my question about that.",12.9
"absolutely amazing game, was great on ps4 and is a mile better on pc. i understand people have been having a few problems which is kind of understandable, but im sure it will all be fixed pretty soon. (its only my friends that have downloaded though the rockstar client that are having the problems with major bugs like falling though the floor, friends that bought on steam have had no problems with no major bugs. just the traffic bug with cars exploding.) besides the few minor bugs, totally worth the money. must buy. have fun everyone. :)",57.4
"amazing, if youve played the previous versions of gta you have to get this one, and for you console ports you have to get this for pc, just an incredible experience.",22.2
"the 3 minutes i get to play before it crashes is great. it has potential, but its not ready yet. far to many hardware configurations for rockstar to sort out yet. give it time, but i wouldnt buy yet.",13.0
"even if you played on ps3/xbox360/ps4/xboner, gta v for pc is much better than a lot thought it would be. its a great port, it feels smoother, looks better, has much better controls, and is just flat out amazing. sure, online has a few bugs but its a day after. and when im writing this, i have so much more time dedicated to this game on ps3, so... story : pretty twisted, kind of dark, but enjoyable and deals with real situations, while having pretty funny parts. and the three protagonists thing was an intresting feature to add. i would definetly recommend. online : my favorite part : its amazing to just mess around with friends and do whatever the  you want :). plus, heists are a great addition to this. so  yes i would recommend this.",23.4
"having played the older version on ps3, this is a huge upgrade. new customzation options, better framerate. first person is a sweet addition and fun to play with. especially driving for me. the launch for online was not as bad as i expected it to be. when the game first came it, it was beyond horendous and even when heists came it, it was bad. but so far i havent had much problems online.",82.2
"meth heads banging, dogs having sex, ambulances rushing to a npcs aid only to leave that npc on the road only to be continually run over by othe npcs is only a fraction of what you can find in this game. not only is the main story engaging, but is rife with homages to decades of film and pop culture (including the garbage pop culture, which i love that rockstar does not hold back in making fun of). although i have not touched the online mode or the editor as of yet, i can only imagine at how much more they add to the gta experience. best gta yet, (although i do miss liberty city tunes), and may be the best game of 2015. i know its bene out of consoles for a couple yrs now, but as far as im concerned pc trumps all.",55.1
"im on a desktop with a gtx 980, i have updated all my drivers, i dont have any anti-virus program installed, my username consists of characters that theyve said are supported ( i even tried making a new one ), ive tried so many things to get it working, ive contacted rockstar support with no response in the past 48 hours, and i still cant get the games launcher to run. ive never had problems like this with any other game on my desktop.",19.0

"dear steam users, when i first downloaded gta v, i was not able to launch the game. when i tried to launch it, my steam said i was playing but only for a few seconds. then nothing happened. confused was i so i decided to do some research. there seemed to be a glitch among portable graphics cards that would not allow the game to launch (i use my trusty asus g750 notebook with an 860m gpu). i tried multiple times, but nothing woud work. after countless attempts, i left for class furiously. i ressolved to give the game a nasty review, but then it happened. just as i sat down to write my strongly worded review, i tried to start my game up one more time. behold, it launched! from that point forward, i have been robbing banks, winning races, and claiming glorious victory! the gameplay was smooth and very nice. after that first hicup, i experienced no other problems with gta 5. for this reason, i recomend this game, and i hope you enjoy it just as i have. p.s. i do not have the slightest idea what i did to fix it.... sorrrrrrrr. sincerely, king vulture",25.9
"im 5 hours in and loving it. rockstar have done an incredible job at optimizing performance, it runs much better than gta4 did on the same pc. if youve played any other gta, you know what youre getting. difference being this time the city is even larger, the graphics are even better, and the swearing is even more frequent.",15.1

"finally..... so im running an overclocked i5-3570k (ivy bridge) and a gtx 970 and the game runs great maxed out. i turn off vsync and refection quality lower since that seems to give me stuttering issues (probably related to ram), but everything else is pretty much as high as it can get. i float around 60-70 fps even with population density all the way up, though it does drop considerably when in a vehicle in first person. not sure what thats about, but they may have a fix for it down the line. the game itself is expectantly great, nothing different from the console versions. havent dabbled in online or heists yet, but im sure theyre just as good as they were on consoles, although im expecting a serious frames drop, but thats bound to happen in a multiplayer setting. all-in-all, if you lost your social life playing the console versions and you want the benefit of higher graphical capabilities and future modding, then dont hesitate to buy the game. its good 98% good to go. anxious to see what the modding community will do with this thing down the road.",25.3

"its with a heavy heart i have to give gta v a bad review - for now. i, like many other laptop users with mobile graphics cards, are experiencing crashing issues nonstop that has completely ruined the experience. story mode, i get a crash roughly every 5-10 loading screens, online (the main reason i bought the game), i get a crash every loading screen so i havent gotten to play it yet at all. i also randomly get crashes on startup. its really a bummer. im a poor college kid so when i spend 60 on a game its a huge deal to me. its a bigger deal when i spend that 60 and i cant play the game. aside from that, the game is really excellent, and when this issue is resolved and i can play the game i will edit this review to reflect the true nature of the game. however, because i cant play the game for more than a half hour at a time before i experience a crash, i cant recommend this game to anyone, especially laptop users who use mobile graphics cards. from what ive read, rockstar doesnt have a fix for these issues pending just yet so save your money and buy when you know youre going to be able to actually play the game and get the experience you paid for.",17.3

"i never played gta v on console but i have to say this game so far is 10/10 the game runs super smooth on all settings. obviously with better hardware you will get better performance in this game, but dont expect to be able to max all of the adcanced settings unless you are sitting on 2 x titan xs. story is really really fun the charachters are all very different from one another and have there own unique characteristics. map is really big, los santos is also really diverse so the ares are all unique and dont get boring with overused textures, vehicles, npcs. the driving in this game is really fun. there are plenty of fast exotic cars and bikes for you to rip through the city or kick it hard on the off road on a dirtbike or raised pickup. the game itself has a lot of personality. the npcs that walk around the city will all react to you and you will even be able to respond to some which results in some pretty good dialogue . ill add in a bit about gta online once i have experienced it all",26.7

"already had this on the xbox one and 360 but i wasnt all that impressed with it. muddy textures and low framerates everywhere. but on the pc it looks beutiful and it is surprisingly well optimized. i manage anywhere from 43-60 fps never dropping below 40 even during the most intense battles on a slightly outdated 2gig amd 7870 gpu and an fx-8350 cpu. game is really fun to play and heists are enjoyable",83.4
"yo, they finally got it to work. looks really nice, plays really nice, and 1st person? aw yiss no you cant aim down the sights of most of the guns, dont get too excited about that...",3.1
"first time i got into a car, kenny loggins danger zone was already playing. 10/10",41.6
"played on both xbox 360 and xbone, but it didnt last half as long as this. 60fps really makes a difference. everything runs smoothly and i see no significant bugs or anything worth noting, aside from connection problems once in a while, dropping me into empty lobbies, but perhaps thats on my side. rockstar did a really great job on this one!",25.8
"just bought the game and ran it. curious - you cant family share this game, like any other. pretty crappy to not have a notification of that.",1.9
"very nice game, enjoy playing gta online with friends after a hard day, worth buying.",22.1
"watched trevor fall over a fence in 60fps 11/10 waited too damn long, not even mad.",52.8
"it took a while but the result is probably the least broken pc relese in recent memory. it does have its issues and there are bugs, but way less then normal ports. pc master race!",59.2
"finally its out for the pc. thanks console players for the beta testing:) just a warning it crashes a lot on windows 8... lets hope they patch it soon.",15.6
"i bought this game when it was released back in 2013 for ps3 and xbox360. i played alot of online and a little bit of singleplayer. i enjoy online the most i think its what makes this game great being able to access the entire map and do whatever you please. now that i own a decent gaming laptop, the graphics are gorgeous and vivid. i am playing at 900p and getting about 35-40 fps. back on ps3 the graphics are unbearable and i dont know how my eyes got used to the frames. i havent noticed any pop in whatsoever (coming from a regular 5400rpm 1tb hdd user). there is a bit of jaggies and stuttering but i have it under control when i set up maximum pre rendered frames to 1 in my nvidia control papnel and power management to maximum performance. i would reccomend this game to anyone it is truely amazing how rockstar developed this game allowing those with not very good specs to play this game even at normal settings the game still looks beautiful. thank you rockstar thank you pc please guys get this game youll be amazed!",14.2
"gta v was already one of the greatest game i have played ( and i am not a fan of the serie, the complete opposite) and now with ultimate edtion pc port. he has the greatest graphic of all . the pc version is well optimised and can run on many gaming computer slower or faster ones there is even a 4k option. i can compare this pc port with a blizzard game if you played any of them you know they are really really well optimized. the push back from release was totally worth it. if i had to say cons about the game. are how the multiplayer is made rockstar should have implemented a party system. and the possibilities of finding remplacement player for the heist dlc and less loading, but they are faster than the console port. there is also the ragdoll but this was also a problem in gta iv as well its a problem with all rockstar game because they are using euphoria physic engine. anyway the game is totally worth it. you got a beautifull game with a great and funny story like only rockstar know how to do. and a great multiplayer with a lot of content. and its big heist mission in solo have two variation. so you can almost double the lenght of the game.",43.4
"its  and i would not recommend buying this. i want my money back!",37.5
"this would be a good game if it wasnt so buggy. online is almost impossible when theres bugs going on all the time. game crashes randomly. ive looked up specs and my machine exceeds requirements. character will stop right when opening door to get into car as if hes frozen in time, wont get in car. they made heists online so you have to have 4 people for most of them, most of the time you have an impossible time getting enough people to join your heist or even stay long enough to get it going, you need to have 3 people you know and are friends with on rockstar online to get a game going well. game crashes randomly and theres bugs. oh did i mention bugs? quit putting out games when you havent ironed all bugs out. patch this pos plz, and soon!",29.7
"played through and beat the game on xbox 360 twice. played online a bit, not heavily, but enjoyed. now that the game is on pc, i can definitely say that rockstar did something right. they added a few things it seems, nothing large, but enough for me to notice. they worked out (most) of the bugs from the console version, which definitely makes me happy. the only thing i cant seem to find any information on, is whether or not ig currency will be able to be bought. sometimes you just need a leg up, and it doesnt seem doable.",17.4
"i was just really blown away from this game it says i spent 1200 hours on the xbox360 version so i know how the game compares i have never played the xbox one nor the ps4 versions except at my friends. the pc port isnt really a port at all the game has the same type of feel as max payne 3 so i think they built a lot onto the game the first person is really nice. the only thing i can say bad about this game is the fact i coulnt get it to run untill 3 days after the release but i dont care if i had to wait a week after the release to play but how i fixed it was i had something idk what on my windows that prevented the game from launching so i just reinstalled windows and it worked completely fine after that and i am curenty really enjoying the game. i think its worth the money if you never played it at all or had it for the 360 if i had it for the ps4 or xbox one i dont think i would of been to driven ro buy it then.",53.9
"i love this game so much, it runs like a smooth wall and everything works so good and fast, i would rate this game 11/10 in all different types, totaly recommend this game ;d",87.1
"its like drugs. it makes you lonely until your friend gets it too",78.8
"ill update when i play it more than i already have. but so far, i somehow managed to drive my truck off a ramp and landed inside a billboard, then i explosively punched a pedestrian. 11/10",23.5
"so long, consoles, and thanks for all the testing!",22.3
"an overall astonishing game, although i noticed when the preload gave me my $1.35 mil, it spread out to gta online, etc. on story, only franklin got money, he got all $500k, oddly, trevor had $100k to start with, which really confused me. overall amazing gameplay experience, good action, nice hud layout, everything, just, flawless. definately worth $60",21.1
"this is a performance review! i barely meet the minimum specs and it runs great! never had it crash and it stays around 40 fps, though the textures on everything but faces and cars look awful. in online it still runs good even when a bunch of idiots with grenade launchers blow everything up. pretty much what i mean is i havent had a single problem, but remember to update your graphics drivers! it makes a big difference!",33.1
"just bought the game and i have the problem that makes the game unplayble so i made 2 ticket to rockstar support and it have been 2 days and still no respond from them eventhough i kept asking on their twitter to check the ticket and i saw people who post their problem earlier than me get help faster.good game,terrible customer support.",9.0
"amazing game, and a great pc port. definitely worth the price. i already have it for console and this is just the icing on the cake.",31.1

"didnt even get to play the game and it already wants me to reinstall, goty 10/10.",15.1
"awsome story mode. online is endless hours of fun and there is a mass amount of content when it comes to online missions, races ect....it will keep me a happy games for a long time! i pre ordered for the 360 and was really pleased with the game. however the pc version seems a lot smoother and the graphics are brilliant on my msi 7970 frozr. i did run across a glitch that game me achievements for reaching level 25 / 50 / 100 in online play & im only level 18! im not sure how i would report this to rockstar if anyone knows give me a message. a solid cash investment, endless fun to be had on this game. nothing quite like running over pedestrians then going to pick up a hooker, get drunk smoke weed get chased by the police and see how long you can survive!",28.6
"still have issues after the patch. some parts of the world isnt loading but frame-rate is fine.",2.9
"works great for me. online only is a little annoying though.",17.8
"awesome game, good activity if you have free time or need to spend time with your friends.",78.8

"this game truly is a masterpiece of modern gaming. it has been refined and refined to the point its at and it is glorious. it genuinely feels like a real living breathing city with immense attention to detail. the graphics are astonishing, everything feels smooth and clean. the gameplay is cinematic and addictive and the dialogue is some of the funniest i have experienced in a video game, i never skip a cutscene or dialogue. 10/10.",30.6

"the game was everything i expected it to be. although the graphics settings are a bit odd. worth every penny i spent on it. i love how you can switch between multiple players. i would highly recomend this to anybody who likes fps, open world, action, and rpg games.",33.7
"so my first gta 5 online experience was as following: the commen 12 year old kid who started picking fights with everyone on the server saying he ed their moms, so the entire server ofcourse went after him. and hunted him everywhere he went while thrastalking back like adults do. when the kid left we started talking about the time it takes to boil potatoes. 10/10 would want the same night again",31.1
"its wonderful, it looks so good, even better than on ps3 and xbox. ive been enjoying this game alot. and i will for a very long time. this is so worth it. if your pc can handle it of course. you can even transfer your character from your ps/xbox to pc, so no worries.",59.6
"this has been in the works for so long o hardly think it could be called a port. r* did an amazing job on this. pros optimized well good keyboard controls loads of graphics options rebindable keys rarely crashes and no game breaking bug, even minor bugs are minimal cons get disconnected from games a lot (this could be just my internet tho) tl;dr- the game is good, i recommend reaading not just my review because im no professional review writer",59.4
"ive always been a big fan of rockstar. they are my favorite developer. that being said i have bought this game 3 times, and it is well worth it in my opinion. i bought this on ps3, xbox one, and now pc. ive been waiting for a pc release since the game was announced in the beginning. this has to be one of the best games i have ever bought because even after around 100 hours on the ps3 version, 40 hours on the xbox one version, and with the above amount on the pc version i still find that this game does and will have a bunch of replayability for years to come. and for the sake of the race: 4k 60fps or die",27.1

"where to start? ok, it amazes me how games now adays have really good graphics, are open world and have so many options. it almost is a reality in in itself. in terms of submersion, these guys get a 10 out of 10. with that said, there are some extreme dislikes i have for this game and the decisions made for putting in this crap. i understand that the game is rated m for mature, but i would like to be able to play a game with my mature adult friends and not feel extremely awkward and stir up hard feelings because i am watching game characters have sex. a mature person wouldnt put that in a game. i dont want to worry if my girlfriend is in the room because i am trying to have fun playing a game then all of a sudden there is a ton of smut in it. i understand that the violence and what not keeps things interesting but there is a point where the creators are going too far and its just not fun anymore.",20.3
"its a great game, but i have a weird issue. when i first start the game it plays perfectly, a decent 50-60 fps until i die. after i die and respawn at a hospital my frames drop, there is minor to moderate freezes and it makes the game unplayable.",18.2

"waited 2 years for a game. gets on and gets shot by a policeman in the first mission. 10/10 would fail again. now proper review : runs amazingly even on my lowish end pc but it is a big step up from gta iv and no roman calls :d . the multiple characters is a boosting pro. but the driving is a bit too over controling, and helicopter controls are impossible. also, for such a popular and high standing company wouldnt you think rockstar would have singplayer cloud saves. as i recently upgraded my pc and my singleplayer is complelty gone. rating : 9.3/10",73.3
"at first i had rated this game poor due to constant crashes and lock ups with it. i had thought it was the game itself, but after some trouble shooting i found the root cause was an outdated bios on my motherboard. seems gta v is the first game to push the cpu hard enough to expose the issue with the older bios. after the bios update the game has yet to crash or lockup. if you have an asus maximus vi motherboard with a bios older than rev 1603 installed and have lockups / crashes. install rev 1603, it will fix the lockup and crash issues. this is by far the best gta game yet and the pc version was worth waiting for. the graphics are insane. being able to jump between mouse and keyboard and 360 controller is awesome. drive a car on the controller, get to a roof top, then jump to mouse and keyboard and use a sniper rifle. my pc can run this on max settings and rarely see fps drop under 52 fps: i7-4790k 16 gb geforce 980gtx 500 gb samsung 850 windows 10 pro",16.4

"great game, almost perfect port(except by windows account problems, some random fps drop, and alt+tab screwing the game). some missions are boring and lame,and some others are ing impossible(requires you to switch the character every five seconds because the dumb ai cant take the anothers characters to be covered,they simply will run into the firefight and get hit and killed and the mission will fail), but it`s no problem since the game have the skip feature. theres also some glitches that will happen when youre inside the mission(like the target that you need to kill get godmode and resist 11 sniper headshots,when you lose the cops and step on the street they will start to looking for you again even after 5 minutes after the stars got away) the gta online is funny to play even when you arent playing with friends, i dont explored the full experience of gta online but its look great! long story short, you might buy this game,both singleplayer and multiplayer are good. good job rockstar,even with the delayed release, it worth it!",54.6

"by far the gta series is one of my favorites game franchises. gta v is the most expansive of all of them. a two year game im already familiar with from the peasant consoles. the pc version is an amazing remaster of the game, with insane graphics, smoothness, and whatnot. with a great story with three protagonists, awesome gameplay, and soundtrack. the online multiplayer is by far the best of the series. at first it is confusing how the lobbies work, but you get used to it. my only con about this game is the, incredibly, lengthy loading screens. but i guess thats what you can expect for a 60gb game.",68.1

"what can i say, the best game of 2013 and 2014 may have just become the best game of 2015. this pc port has proven to be very well optimized, with as many graphical options you could possibly want. (except for a true fov slider). the game runs well on a variety of machines and scales very well to different setups. my set up is; 12 gigs of ram, amd fx-6300 hexa-core cpu, and a nvidia gtx 970 gpu. with this set-up i can achieve almost all maxed out settings at 1080p. with the technical aspects aside the game is pretty much the same as the latest generation consoles, with noticeable improved controls for shooting while using mouse and keyboard and vastly improved draw distance. those who are frustrated at the issues downloading and the rockstar social club, it is understandable, but rating the game based on those issues and not the game itself is very unreasonable; the purpose of a review to provide insight on the game itself, not reviewing overloaded servers on the day of launch. no game is perfect, thus rating any game 10 is idiotic, but if any game is deserving of my highest praise, gta v would be that game. i highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of sandbox games or a fan of previous rockstar games.",16.0
"i want to give thanks to the console peasants who alpha tested the game on the ps3 and 360 as well as the rest of the peasants who beta tested the game on the ps4 and xbone. seriously, thanks to your long testing we on the pc were able to get the best version of the game. thanks :d",41.2

"the game is fun enough, the story is funny and you always have something to do. online is kinda lame since youd normally go from single player with all the items to online with nothing, and if you dont have a group it seems like a gank fest for the most part which can be fun if youre into that kind of thing. my only real complaint about the game is the horrible controls. with a gamepad its not to bad but mouse / keyboard it is so awkward and clunky. for example you go through the game using wasd for movement and then suddenly go into a plane and it wants you to use your num pad, wasd, and then youre expect to look around with your mouse. they could have done a lot better with just using your mouse to steer the plane and wasd to control pwr and left and right (forgeting the name). the game is fun and once you get over the controls is very good. id highly suggest atlest having a gamepad of some sort atlest plugged in for those flight missions since its very easy to switch between the two.",7.6
"could play at launch, only had one unexplained crash. story mode is alright, multiplayer needs a bit of stability improvement, but graphics and average fps are top-notch. this is how pc games should be released instead of bullspit deadlines and moronic over-hype. just wish it would have come out sooner than waiting so long for two generations of consoles to beta-test.",62.3

"very disappointing. having not played this on another platform previously, it was entirely new to me. the plot is very very poorly written, haphazard, vague, and short. if i hadnt messed about doing unnecessary things it could easily be completed in 10 hours. compared with gta 4, the story is severely lacking. the graphics engine and port to pc however, very well done. after the debacle with the gta 4 port i was worried. but this was ported very well and even on an old machine runs well on mid graphics. the online experience isnt particularly inspiring however. feels like they tried to include a lot, and in doing so made it quite unenjoyable. i wish i could recommend this, the engine and potential are great. but the story and characters are just pathetically scripted. their actions in the parts you cannot control make no sense at all (including the npcs), and if there is a plot that youre supposed to be able to follow, it seems huge parts of it are never spoken, and just assumed happened. wait until its on offer, was not worth preordering.",56.8
"this is a very well made game; however, at the time of this review, the gta online portion sucks...it is really laggy and there are some major sync issues. i havent had any problems with the single player though. i hope they continue to patch it so that he multiplayer is not shoddy, and i think they eventually will. rockstar isnt going to give up on us. its just disappointing since it took them two years and 3 delays to release it. there is no real good excuse other than they are new to doing this online for pc. anyway, fun as hell. never had so much fun doing a burnout on a hookers face, and you can do it in 4k too!",26.8

"games good, but after 30 minutes or so i get crazy stuttering/lurching/hitching/frame drops/whatever you want to call it. the game runs at a stable, silky 60fps for a half hour or so, and then itll start lurching down to 30-40fps at random intervals every few seconds until i restart the game. usually itll start after ive driven somewhere fast, but once it starts i can be sitting stationary in a safehouse and itll still continue unabated. i run a 660ti and i7 3770 with 8gb of ddr3 for anyone who cares, but its not a hardware issue: ive been reading around forums with people with identical issues who run the whole gamut of available hardware configurations, from amd to intel and nvidia, from high-end to low-end. just be aware that until they fix this, buying this game is a roulette of performance irrespective of the power of your setup: maybe youll get lucky and be in the majority who find it smooth, or maybe youll be condemned to frame stutter hell like me and a bunch of other people. ill edit this review to recommend this game when they fix the problem.",59.6
"im sure everyone knows what gta is, so i will skip right to it. the pc version is extreme well optimized. i have been running it with barely over minimum system requirements, and although the graphics are pretty limited with my crap computer, the game still runs smooth. i may update this after i install my new gpu. i love the self radio station, where it allows you to import your own music playlists into the game and listen to them either as a regular playlist, or as an actual radio station with dj commentary in between songs. the rockstar editor tool is also amazing, allowing you to film your gameplay and edit yourr clips into a movie for uploading on youtube, and you can upload your clips directly from the in-game menu. you can seemlessly switch between using your game pad, and your keyboard/mouse, without needing to change any settings. this helps with navigating menus and editing your rockstar editor clips. i cant say much about the graphics, for reasons i have already stated, but im told its amazing with a proper gpu. bottom line, this game is well worth your money, even if you already own it on a console.",39.6
"amazing port very fun. i played they story mode on ps3 a while back and that was fun. i have only been playing online on pc and i love all the updates. the first person is great and its really fun to play with friends or do a pick up mission and play with randoms (hoping they have mics). all and all very worth it",64.8

"the game itself is amazing! it is fun as hell. in terms of performance, it runs like a charm. i heard the 750ti was able to get a 50 to 60fps on high 1080p. the downside are the current drivers : they arent too get yet. it may take another month for amd to release better drivers. performance is good but stuttering and fps drops can occur - they are rare though. there is also an issue with system ram. if you play for about 2 hours, your ram will start to fill up. this maybe a slow memory leak. it sucks for those who have less than 8gb. hell, i have 8gb and this ram issue occurs within 2 to 3 hours of play.",36.3

"ok to be even able to open the game i, need to go to device manager disable my gpu and when launcher appears reenable my gpu. then, i have to go to settings and put in fullscreen every single time. then i need to go to task manager, go to details, select gta v process and set priority to high to partially fix the render problem in which ground and buildings just dissapear and i walk on the air. and if im lucky and the game doesnt crash when i change priority (and start all over again), then, only then i am able to play this game though has some bugs. makes me feel the tried to compete with skyrim and fallout with the bugs. final verdict: i love the game 10/10",61.5

"this game looks so much better on the pc then on the xbox 360 i played on while i was waiting for pc release. its all the little things that make this game amazing and the time and effort they spent on the story making the characters so great together and online isnt bad either. in my opinion its one of the best games ever made. i just wish there were more games like this one",49.4

"i dont even know what to rate the game. its a good game ill just get that out the way. it is a good game. my 1 and only complaint is you spend 60 bucks on a game ..... you should be allowed all things in the game because you paid for it. run out of cash go onliine and buy some more, dont like your car go online and buy a better 1. why da  am i paying more money for something i paid full price for. there getting carried away with this item mall  on full priced games, so you got 60 for the game another 30 for a season pass or some  because you know its coming out and you play and see someone has a better car can you get it nah because you gotta buy the  in cash why the  did i just pay full price on your game if you want me to buy game content with cash  off suck a . after realising what i put. 10/10 for story mode -5/10 for online mode out selling call of duty wasnt enough during its time of release on consoles lets  around and hold up em by there ankles and watch the change fall out . big  disappointment. for online play.",71.0

",eifbgnaevn soooo good. played it originally on the xbox 360(barf). i expected the same, but with pc graphics but it ended up feeling differnt somehow. it is really well optmized, though mobile nvidia cads have issues but there is a simple workaound until they fix it so, *shrug*. i end up really liking the pc controls more than gamepad control, though i still enjoy gamepad for flying. it is a seemless transition between keyboard and gamepad, no pop up thing, no pause, nothing. anyways, i had a lot of fun with it and it is definitely worth picking up. oh, and i have more time in the game then steam says, so idunno why it only registered this amoun of time.",3.9

"this game is incredible! not only is it optimized for pc, but the graphics and pretty much everything have made the pc version a definitive version. however, there are a few quirks for this game, at least for me. also, keep in mind most of these problems are specific to online. first is that the stocks for bawsaq in story mode seem to be broken (not moving) for now, but i believe it will be fixed in a new update soon. the second is that transferred characters have a few problems on them, notably the lipstick problem. however, it can be fixed through a simple trip to the barber shop, but even then, it is an inconvenience. those are pretty much the only problems. overall, this game was worth the wait and delays, considering how polilshed it is. i do, however, believe that we will be seeing new features, as well as performance optimizations from rockstar in the next few weeks.",56.0

"took me four days to get it working, but when i did, i was and wasnt disappointed. i was disappointed by the graphics and shadowing. the shadows for me at least, were pixelated and horrendous. the shadows went through typical textures and just was a massive turn-off. since there are so many shadows, its really hard to ignore them. they were so gross, i just had to stop playing. hoping that when i play it next, the game fixes itself. i know for sure my computer should be able to play it with ease. as it can play each other aaa game out there without breaking a sweat. but for some reason, gta v is just like lol,  you, suck my , i aint workin for you. the graphics, for me at least, were exactly like ps3/ps4, with no noticable difference. as the gta series is my favorite game series alive, i am going to recommend this. but, a lot of people have been having problems. so be wary when buying this game. you could  your pants on how amazing it is, or you could thrash your keyboard on how big of a waste of money it was.",1.8

"moving on from the console versions of gta v, even after months of delaying and waiting, this game proves to still amaze all gamers. obviously, the graphics is the biggest upgrade, but the delation for the release of the game turned out well for its great optimization to the pc port. its amazing how relatable gameplay is with consoles just by using a controller. feels like theres no difference except (better) performance, graphics, and details in the game (like its music). i already owned a 360, ps4, and xbox one version of gta v, but it was well worth $60 to buy the pc version. you get what you paid for, and even more. this pc port is what every game developer should aim for. how optimized it is at launch compared to other games that releases a dead-bugged game that makes it almost impossible to play. its safe to say that all gta players will be missing out on a new experience if they dont purchase this game. 10/10",33.4

(fx-4100) the textures look great compared to the previous version i played on the last-generation consoles, even on the normal setting. the game has a very useful video memory gauge like the other rockstar ports which makes tweaking the options a cinch. i had no trouble transferring over my gta online character from the ps3 version, and the online so far hasnt given me any trouble in terms of connectivity. i did have some trouble with what seemed like mouse acceleration, and i was unable to find an option to disable it. but after changing from raw input to directinput it seems to be much better. all in all, id say it was worth the wait.",40.4

"10/10 amazing to play this game @60 fps. only problem is that the game crashes frequently. hopefully rockstar will patch this in the future. :d",11.3
"by all accounts a good, well optimized game. the ui, controls are fantastic. the graphic options and graphical quality is exceptional, especially for the performance i get on low-end hardware. they really put a lot of work into optimizing this and tweaking the engine to perfection. far more than any company has anything else released in years. that is, if it runs at all. theyre dragging their feet about fixing the myriad of issues which plague many players. at this time i do not recommend buying it with a 50% chance that itll just crash repeatedly, either during the intial launch of the launcher itself, or during gameplay.",52.9
"i can without a doubt say that this is my favorite game of all time. on the ps3 ive spent over 500 hours in it, and im gonna spend even more on pc when its been upgraded so much. definitely recommend this.",48.6
"after watching the positive pc port report video totalbiscuit made i figured gta v would be a great pick up, but unfortunately i ran into so many issues rightaway that i ended up requesting a refund which was still an option due to the other problems the game had. issues i had: - jerky/laggy mouse movement in the menu. changing vsync or mouse input didnt help. - settings didnt save after quitting the game and restarting - display calibration screen on every start - benchmark crashed to desktop after a 3 minute black screen - fps tied to sensitivity (not this crap again, sigh) i run a i7-4790k, 16 gb, r9 290x machine and from what i could see from my short experience, the actual framerate ingame is fine so performance seems ok otherwise. this is the first refund ive ever requested and im glad it was still an option. fully priced games, in this case even more, should always have an option for refunds to avoid these sorts of things. one thing steam could learn from origin. i hope they patch the game and fix all these issues because i am certain the underlying game is brilliant, but i just cant support it while theres so many problems before even getting to the actual playing part.",0.8
"amazing game, rockstar obviously wanted to do the best delivery of a game they could and even if they didnt, that was achieved anyway but im sure they were. amazing graphics, better than any console graphics, 60fps makes it so much better and feel like youre actually there at times when youre in the amazing... 1st person mode! which you get on ps4 and xbox one anyway but still it looks way better on the pc. director mode makes it way better aswell because you can play as so many different characters and costumed characters which is alot of fun when bored in the game. definitely recommended (if you have a graphics card of atleast radeon hd 7770) but it might look alright on a lower one, but yeah definitely recommended!",16.4

"problems i currently have with gta 5 - loading delay when the game launches - resolution changing from fullscreen to windowed - built in benchmark program does not work properly - graphics stuttering, especially when driving - some textures and objects loading at a slow pace which result in blurred images on the screen ive updated to the amd experimental drivers for gta 5, which helped a lot. im disappointed in amd, they need to make better drivers and churn them out at a faster pace for big game launches. switching to lower graphics improves the fps, but doesnt remove the stuttering. so once again im in this waiting game for bug fixes. the sad thing is this is rockstar games best port they have done for the pc recently. both max payne and la noire had more problems at launch, but eventually those games ran very smooth for me on high settings. shame on rockstar for the mediocre port, shame on amd for the mediocre drivers, and shame on me for pre-ordering again from a publisher with a history of pc launch problems. this game is great, ive played in on ps3 and i really want to play it on pc and change this to a positive review :(",2.3

"i dont know why i am surprised that this game doesnt work. if we have gotten to a point where you are considered an idiot for buying a game on launch day because horror stories about crashes and poor optimization are more common than grains of sand on the beach, then something is very wrong. i strongly suggest that nobody purchase this game, even if it is eventually fixed for the majority of users. it is honestly ridiculous. rockstar had literally billions of dollars to develop this game, pushed the release date back multiple times, and still launched a broken game for about 1/4 of the people who bought it. this needs to stop, and all i can say is that rockstar will never get another cent of my money.",11.4

"this game is great. the game was amazing for x360/ps3then it moved to the next gen consoles whoch only improved it more by adding first person and little gameplay changes. now its out for pc, and the game is outstanding. the gameplay controls well with a keyboard and mouse, but if you dont like keyboard and mouse, this offers full controller support. the game is improved massively just by adding better graphics and 60 fps. this version also has everything the x360/ps3/xbone/ps4 had and more. you also get bonuses if you are coming back from the console versions. this game has been so improved i cant cover everything. list: pros: 1. keyboard and mouse feels fluid 2. full controller support 3. graphics are nice 4. community is much better 5. gameplay is improved cons: 1. needs optimisation 2. lags for no reason at points (i.e. in garage in online and in the desert) 3. you need at least 1.5 gigs of video memory to make the game look normal 4. you need 3-4 gigs of memory to make the game look as nice as possible 5. you need a great computer to run this so 9/10",69.9

"one of the greatest games of all times, does not disappoint when finally arriving for the pc. a true masterpiece of work. though there are still alot of opportunities for improval on some areas. looking forward to see the modding communities deliver some stunning mods. 10/10",49.8
"its good but the graphics needs work in normal mod for example the roads in los santos takes long time to load with makes the driving hard in missions also the things like light poles and other small stuff takes long time to load too but the rest is awsome",76.5
"slightly stupidly good with hints of exceptional, if this was an ice cream flavour it would be kardashian pussey. dont wait any longer just buy it, and buy a better graphics card too, just so you can turn up everything to get the full pussey flavour !",37.3

"went for a ride with a friend along the coast. shot a woman in the face. 10/10, would shoot again. serious note: the game is just damn pretty. if you like the previous ones, prepare to have your face melted. a+ servers for pc launch day, smoothest launch ive seen so far. (there were hiccups, but within 2 hours i was online and playing with friends without issues, which is pretty damn amazing considering the volume of people.)",27.2
"i bought the game on xbox 360 when it first came out, and i have no problem paying a second time, for this pc version. 10/10 would pay again.",28.0

"10/10 a literal masterpiece. you will want 16gb of ram, an ssd, a newer i7, and a video card with minimum 3gb of vram to enjoy this game near max graphics. a masterpiece of video gaming as we know it. nothing else can be said. a masterpiece.",64.0
"one of my fave games of all time. own it on all three platforms, my wallet hates me but it had to be done. :d",44.1
"easily a 10/10. the attention to detail in the game is staggering. plus, the custom radio station can play .flac files.",40.0
"truly amazing. excellent port, i can almost max it out( in 1080). graphics are solid, and gameplay is amazing. controls are top notch, havent had any issues. the game is obviously the same, but pc has better damage, and a first person mode, among the much better graphics. the first person is a huge part of the game. every car interior is different, the lights on the dash function, small dings when you open the door, everything is detailed. the guns you hold in your hand have been redone, looking amazing from a first person perspective. definetely worth the buy, a pc game done right. #pcmasterrace",38.7
"this is a kind of game you can always go back to.this is a kind of game you can play and feel like youre crontrolling a movie.this is a kind of game you can play as racer or fps.this is my kind of game",23.9
"after launch and when it was done unpacking it was difficult to get started, but once i got it working i couldnt stop thinking, holy **** this is great. i would recommend to anyone with a decent desktop, even my budget pc can run at a smooth 30-40 fps.",46.4
"it worth all the waiting time. great graphics, impressived perfomance, really 60fps. well done. well done rockstar!",31.8
"this game is amazing. walked down the street, saw a dog, walked up to the dog, got hit by a truck. 10/10 would get distracted on a busy highway again",59.4
"its a good game. i play it on my ps3. but pcs version doesnt want to work. an error message comes up before i launch the game saying that social club isnt installed properly (it is though). so ill change this review once it starts working for me. until then the frustration persists.",48.9
"earn micheal, amanda calls. ugh, wife.... search for  to relieve stress. honk horn at some gangstas in search for s, they get mad. honk again, they pull out their nines and and start shootin. drive into loop full of gangstas shooting at me. wasted.",23.3
"huge game doesnt do it justice. great graphics, top-notch gameplay, and tons of stuff the average person wont ever do. third-person action game, with first-person thrown in as well, that uses a three-person main character storymode all about heists, revenge and the like. multiplayer is a blast, with buying apartments, cars, and weapons with the objective being what you want to do. you can race, heist, deathmatch, or just enjoy the fanastic chaos that will ensue!",4.7
"ps4 version looks and runs better. it can feel nice for a bit at 60fps but frequent frame drops destroy the experience. there is also a very restrictive graphics options menu, as in you can change the options but the game will not let you play the game if it thinks you are out of memory. this can happen often as the game does not pick up on multiple graphics cards and large amounts of ram. a better port than gtaiv but its still not a high enough quality to warrant purchasing this version. only buy if you have a rig way above the reccomended settings and can afford a new hard drive because this is a resource hog and a disgusting large game to install. all in all the order for gta v goes ps4/xbone > pc >360/ ps3.",1.4
"it is just the best game i have ever played in my entired life! very well made! if the first person mode had the rear view mirrors with quality view at least for the driver i would call it 100%",27.4
"*pro tip, ignore the negative reviews that have 20+ hours of gameplay but their review states they are locked out of the game... by far the best game in the series. first person view mode is a great addition to an already fantastic game, crisp graphics and a video editor are just icing on the cake. story is good and improved from previous versions by having 3 main characters, all of which are introduced to eachother through some pretty funny circumstances. the multiplayer is top notch and considering it was a free update (from 360/ps3) its amazing rockstar has delivered as much as they did. heists improve the mp even further by giving you a team and multiple objectives to work towards a high payout. none of the previous gtaiv issues on pc are present and it really seems rockstar learned some valuable lessons from their previous release. i cant recommend this game enough.",22.6
"spent hours driving around searching for hookers and punching the  out of them. 10 out of 10",15.7
"to say this is a good game is like saying that the ceiling of the sistine chapel is a nice painting. you play it and wonder why all games cant be as good as this. brilliant gameplay, story ,graphics, sub games, achievements. i am 7 hours in and so far i have loved every second. has to be one of the best games i have ever played.",28.4
"like gta v for consoles, but prettier. 11/10 would buy for ps4",9.4
"great game just got a lot of lagg issues at the moment damn cpu but great game",9.7
"very impressive port for pc, i would highly recommend it. if you dont have any friends who have it or will be getting it then i do not recommend it. i have had it on xbox 360 and the graphics and expierence is higher in an extreme. i suggest you use a controller, but it is not very nessecary.(just depends on prefernce.) plus mods will be coming out soon im sure, so that will be fun. before you start or buy this game i highly suggest updating your graphics to the newest version. i do not know what it is currently is for nvidia but for amd it is 15.4 beta on the amd website.",24.1
"dont let someone with a stupid username that cant log in turn you away from this game. its awesome. ive been playing gtas since the top down days and with each entry it just gets better and better. i cant wait to keep digging and turn los santos inside out. i have experience zero troubles and im getting excellent frames on high everything. i5 3570 8gb @ 1600mhz gtx 760 4gb its running beautifully.",3.7

"amazing. to the console version, theres no competition. i am running at full settings on a laptop, getting a minimum of 30 fps, if i wanted to tone those settings down, were talking 60 fps! grand theft auto has always been a great series, with gta v trumping all the others. even if you already have the console version, paying the extra $60-70 is totally worth it!",9.5
"runs very nicely on my i5/r9 290 machine. a lot of people reporting various problems on opening day, but my install and day 1 gameplay (both story mode and gta online) went off without a hitch. looking forward to how well this game will look as further optimization and bug fixes come along. this is the way gta was meant to look. as far as the gameplay goes, im fairly new to the gta universe and i did my first online heist today. good fun. recommended! edit: dont forget to update your gpu drivers! both amd and nvidia have made adjustments for this game!",60.4

"i never expected to enjoy gta v after how dispointing it was in 2013 when it released on xbox 360 and ps3. the biggest problems with those versions was the abysmal framerate and that the game took away actual gameplay with auto-aim. im very pleased by the above average pc port that rockstar gave to this title. this game is far more comparable to the ps4 / xbone versions as the graphics have been increased, with the addition of first person mode. the better graphics and framerate really show that this is the definitive edition of the game that for some reason took way longer than it should have.",21.0
"very fun game ..... i am pretty sure you knew that tho !",26.9

"extremely enjoyable game, well balanced and performs very nicely on most hardware it seems!",25.0
"no doubt this is the best version of gta v, just a shame it took this long to get here. optimization is pretty good but definitely could be better, the graphics looks stunning along with the improved pedestrian and traffic density. the settings is also pretty good with a lot of options. overall id say it was worth the wait, but next time dont make us pc gamers wait this long and release it alongside the console version.",43.7

"a rare, but fantastic, port from rockstar. the development team have clearly learned that the pc community wont be satisfied with copypasta garbage (*cough* gta iv *cough) and, as a result, have come out with a highly optimised game that can truly be considered the difinitive version. hopefully soon, those guys on gtaforums or whoever will be able to crack and modify the game folders they can, currently, only see through openiv. the modding potential for this game is enormous... its just a shame that rockstar didnt embrace this idea as openly as, say, bethesda with skyrim and the like. if you can run it (and you porbably can), buy it. this is one of the best open world games ever created and youd be doing youself a disservice not to have it on your hard drive.",24.2
"i have to addmit i was dissapointed with how badly this games launch went for me (not that i wasnt expected some sort of issue), my game wouldnt even launch. but once i found a fix and got round the issue and can realy recommend this game. it is a big step up from gta iv. the campaign is great and the multiplayer is even better. if you are having issues with this game stick them out, it will be worth it in the end.",76.6
"the graphics are amazing, game play and story is immersive and flow together perfectly. with all the other aaa titles that have come out this past few years that where buggy and unplayable, it was refreshing to see just how well this game preformed on release day. good job rockstar it was worth the wait. please release more dlc storys for this game.",34.4

"i beta tested this on ps3 and then ps4 so you didnt have to. the graphics on this are better than irl so i dont go outside anymore. what even is life anyway? also, what got me thinking is that i heard somewhere that jelly fish are something like 97% water right. so what purpose does that serve? its doing nothing, give it another 3% and just make it water instead. add me on social club - itslloydm8. or steam here. im looking to just have some casual fun on #gtaonline (no water sports though) and my safe word is spaghetti. later bros.",17.3

"this game is one of the greatest games of all time, i mean as of right now you can see it has 19000 positive reviews, i have been playing the gta series since i was a kid, i owned gta 1, and had gta2 on dream cast, and to see it come from its early days from a unknown developer at the time called dma to becoming rockstar, and eventually rockstar north and being this beautifully crafted game is amazing to watch over the years of playing. the wait sucked for pc, but thank you rockstar for another beautiful, epic story line, built on a beautiful, breath taking environment. i fear death because i know once im gone, i wont be able to play these awesome epic games anymore. lol, how much i love gta, and a great improvement on port this time!!! standing applause!!!!",0.2

"hadnt played this game on console at all due to wanting to wait for the pc version and it was definitely worth it! this game has been loads of fun. all the aspects of it, from single player to the multiplayer (which in my opinion is the piniacle of this gta experience) is spot on! so many different things to do to keep you and your friends busy for hours on end! and the heists are just great fun! i recommend this to everyone out there if youve liked any of the gta games of the past.",47.0

"you will loose your social life, your girlfriend, jobs and whatever else you had. you will not touch any other game. itll be only you and v. v and you. no game should be this good. next time i hope rockstar makes a worse game than this so i dont loose my life.",48.0
"at the moment the console version is better there is alot of issues. i have never once played without some sort of issue. its either a graphic error, the game minimizing and not opening, randomely freezing but i can still hear sounds around me, or it wont even launch. 2 years and the only thing different is the number of players and the graphics its kinda dissapointing atm.",21.3

"until they fix the ongoing problem of still a large amount of players that cant even get past the social club this gets a thumbs down. as expected gtav was released to pc with a boat load of bugs just how it was released on ps3 and 360 for the first time. social club support is as horrid as steam support because no one answers your question. i really want to play this damn game but now i have to waittill they fix this game.",7.9

"now that finally my game started working (after spending a few hours). i can say that this game is worth every single euro/buck. the graphics are absolutly amazing and a game very well optimized. the story is interesting, more detailed than the story mode on ps3/4 or xbox. the mode online is interesting and fun, consider it the multiplayer playground where everything can happen. this game is, what everyone expected a 9/10 ign rate. until now ive seen no bugs. a very good game to spend some hours playing and great to play with friends. i cant wait to see the mods that are coming. if you are not decided if u should or not buy, i tell you that you should. see you there!",17.3

(unable to start gta v, please reinstall) ===> keep in mind, reinstalling takes about 14-18 hours via steam -> didnt reinstall, restarted the pc 3 times then it worked for a few minutes -> played online crashin every 10-30 minutes -> found out that u r able to see statistics. how many player killed, time played, time for every session ===> average time spend per session: 20 minutes ===> i like the idea that rockstar has statistic how often my game crashes per hour and its obviously every 20 minutes ===> when u play heists which sometimes take 2 hours with 4 players in the game, u begin to cry uncontroled and fapping at the same time when ur game crashes tip for the crashers if your game crashes permanently: change graphic direct x 11 to direct x 10 and put off fxaa and mxa. then my game only crashes every 1 - 3 hours. actualy social club is offline so 6/10 for this game because i even keep on playin when its crashin every 20 minutes then i begin fapping and crying",71.3

"game of the year 2k15! positive things about the game: everything they fix everything right away great game holy crap they got insanley much things to do in the game you can even watch tv in the game and the programs are great! negativ things: may counter some lag or desync on servers loading can buy in-game money with real money (cheating, no joke. youre just skipping the best part about the game by buying in-game cash) and thats it, i would recommend this game.",69.4

"there are few things that pisses me off in gta v but the most annoying is time after death! yes, when you die your screen gets gray and with big wasted leathers ower it and it lasts 3 seconds.... i am playing this game only to enjoy in good ragdolls after death but here i cant even enjoy in that 3 sec. thats big minus to this game in my opinion. other negative stuff from game: - cops insta kill you usually, 1 shot from 10+ m and your gone from full hp - some bushes are indestructible and can stop every vehicle from full speed (it will stop airplane in place...) - in gta5 online many parts of game are missing, like animals, taxi... - in gta5 online all players are shown in map so you cant sneak up on someone or play without stalkers",30.2

"the game looks great, it feels great, the world is huge! but thats about it. there are very few side missions, the main missions are fun, but the map is so huge and there is so little to do that it leaves me empty. i dont recommend this to anyone, just about finished it at 40 hours, but i could have had it done earlier than that. you cant buy houses, there is pretty much no point in buying businesses at all. playing from australia, gta online sucks. i am always matched with people from the us and . so if im trying to shoot someone, or say, just drive around, half the time people are just clipping around me. oh i got this guy! no you dont, because he is a kilometre away now and youve just been shot in the head. sad, i had high hopes and gtaiv was great. heaps of missions and . in this you dont build anything with your characters. they dont actually go anywhere. they dont create empires or even take them down. sad. 5/10.",49.3

"easily the best entry in the series to date. memorable and interesting characters along with neat new mechanics such as the special abilities and character swapping. as pc ports go, its mostly a top notch job, with a few quirks such as goofy mouse+keyboard controls for a few things. in almost all cases a controller will remain the prefered method of play, at least in single player. gta online tends to require the more precise aim of the mouse. few notes of warning though, the load times can be pretty intense if not running this on an ssd, and there appears to be some sort of memory leak as frame rates will stay 60+ for a few hours, then plummet dramatically.",39.9

"well.. awesome game overall, prefect graphics, first person, nice missions like heist. although i currently have 18 hours of gameplay which may not seem much but when you play this game you will notice its not a game you could play for 48 hours in a row. of all the 18 hours i have spent i have spent 7+ hours just trying to get into a heist/mission. the loading screen is way to long. hope they fix it so you can play this game without checking your phone ever 5 minutes because its a 20 minute long loading screen.. if you dont have a job / school / social life, well then you obviously have time to play this so then it would probably be worth it! its hard to say if it is worth it or not, but the game itself is so good that i have to recommend it.

"i really did like this game when there were things to do in the single player world. my biggest issue however, is lack of places to go. there is a huge city here, but you can not enter almost any of its buildings, where i understand this for most small buildings, there are large buildings that feel like they should have been enterable, such as the mall, certain sky scrapers. but really though the biggest one for me is that you can buy businesses like bars. but you can not enter them. its a great big city, but its an empty city.",41.8

"the definitive version of an already critically-acclaimed game. this game deserves every bit of praise it got in the past and now all that praise can also be applied to a wonderful pc version that plays well on a wide variety of different systems. a must have game if you like rockstars open world formula and above average storytelling/character development.",25.1

"if someone gives a positive review, that probably means their game launched successfully. if someone gives a negative review, that probably means their game failed to launch. you can guess how my game did.",30.1
"this game was worth the wait! it is perfect and has patched its problems and looks crazy beautiful. this is game of the decade and you are missing out if you dont buy it",34.8
"it works great(not while on any heist missions) and is as always a great game......right up until it freezes....and ultimately crashes for me, for some reason these heists end up freezing my game which in turn i alt+tab and see the message gta 5 has crashed message.....i thought maybe lowering the graphics down a bit will help it.....nope.....lowering all graphics to the lowest wont do anything, it continues to freeze up and crash in the end, but this is only on the heist missions, and due to this i am now teamed up with baddies, since i end up leaving during a heist....the game is awesome......but they really need to fix this stuff.....",21.8
"the game is fun, from what ou can play. the load times are ridiculous. it will take about 5-6 minutes to load from event to event. gta v/0nline is not worth the money atm; maybe in a year, when the game is updated, it will be",18.8
"i was quite dissapointed, there wasnt an easter event? i was hoping for easter eggs that explode, with guts and blood flying everywhere because the baby chick is still inside, 0/10. wheres the bunny ear inflated bumper karts? i wanted to race in giant bunny ears that explode into blood and guts on impact, and causing you to be mauled by mutant bunny rabbits. and bunny strippers, playboy mansion doesnt count. bad rockstar, i wanted to be appeasing to the furry crowd. now i have to use deviantart, /sigh.",63.7

"a really great port for one of the more stranger stories in the gta franchise though dont mistake the strange for anything but greatness",2.3
"do i really need to tell you how incredible gta v is? the pc version of one of the largest open world games is nothing short of incredible as expected. one of the greatest parts of the pc version is how well optimized the game is and how beautifully it runs. the addition of first person adds a whole new layer to the gameplay and is quite well done actually. why are you still reading? why havent you bought it yet?",16.6

"the game has a lot of potential, especially the online-mode. however, things wanted by a majority of the gta online community, e.g. more clothing, car customization, more diversity(missions), putting cop cars or any other special vehicles into garages, etc. those simple things could make a lot of people really happy e.g. the roleplay community, but the devs dont seem to care. kinda sad. i cry evry time",53.7
"this game crashes more times than my driving around the city. they just launched a patch but still crashing while driving and trying to shoot at the same time. wait some more time until they fix this bs.",2.7
"can no longer say 10/10 id call it more 6/10 due to the huge amount of time spent in loadscreens. massive leap forward compared to what gta iv was. this game looks amazing on max settings if your pc can take it. its all been very well polished. not sure it was worth the 2 year wait. thats still b*lls**t. online mode and heists are alot of fun. if youve been a fan of the gta series you wont be dissapointed getting this. edit: found 1 giant con finally. the game is so poorly optimized in how you join other games, matches or instances. you are constantly flung into loadscreen hell. they are incredibly long and often will begin loading into one lobby only after a minute or two it says its full so you enter a new load screen to go back to where you were. then before you can act enter another loadscreen to try and find another instance etc etc etc. loadscreeen hell. it happens often that you will spend an average of 2 or 3 minutes suffering through loadscreens. sometimes longer.",91.1

"it does have the same good features of the console version but youd need a very solid pc to run it efficiently. i particularly had problems with playing gta online. shame really as thats what i was looking forward to. my pc was made with gaming in mind but it struggles with this game. only purchase if you have the hardware to go for it. the recommended specifications are where your pc specs should be minimally. you have been warned!",1.1
"you should buy this game. this game was changed my mind, the humanity, everything was changed. when i was a child ive think what game is the best of the best of the world? that time i guess battlefield is the best game of the world but now im not so sure. this game was changed my mind. you should buy this game, very nice!! (im so bad of english, thanks)",11.7

"grand theft auto 5, well.. first of all its a brilliant game even for being two years old on the consoles, its definatley worth the purchase, if you have a couple of friends too, this game becomes too fun! i have spent too many hours laughing really hard that my jaw starts to ache. so yes, i highly recommend this game! so the downsides to gta v on the pc that i have found so far. unexpected game crashes - yes i have the latest drivers. random fps drops.. that could be just me but for some reason my game runs at a nice and steady framerate then all of a sudden drops to 1-3 for like 4 seconds and then straight back to normal. final bad point that i can think of, the servers, even though a couple of my mates and myself have a decent connection, we still find that they are bouncing all over the roads when doing races. the same for ai traffic too! overall, i rate this game a 8/10 and would highly recommend buying this game.",23.2

"online takes forever between screens! please make it more agile so the races can get started faster. at the moment, we spend more time waiting and loading than actually playing. thanks",56.6
"so despite the problems people were having, i experienced non. this game is truely remarkable and might i add, the best sandbox game currently out. gta v ultimately became, what gta iv was supposed to be. online is awesome, casually get my crew and start blasting people away with a rhino or just casually going for a drive. gta v has it all, the activities could be expanded though, but hopefully r* will add some more features in the future, with the anunciation on activities. and ofcourse the main event. heists. heists with a full crew makes it all the more better. and if rockstar will continue support for this game, itll last for years just like the cs games.",82.3
"this game is amazing, i have a pretty bad graphics card atm, and it runs perfect 40-60 fps without lagging. i really recommend this game.",33.9
"for some reason game will not run on my amd xfx 7870s when i have them in crossfire, but otherwise on one gpu it runs beautifully on high on one. some hiests have glitches in them but that will be patched with time.",34.9

"i had this for the 360 and was pleased to hear a port to the pc. (pc master race) imported my character. kept all my money and apartment. lost my cars and race progress including unlocks as well as all campaign missions. not that big of a deal. oh well. the games looks awesome but there are a few problems. one of the more popular ones is the windows user account name error. but there there are a lot of other problems. ive encountered a crash when i try to run it on default graphical settings. essentially everything is on very high with msaa and such all on. had to turn all that post processing stuff off as well as drop the refresh rate to 60hz and turn off shadowplay to avoid the crash. kind of a bummer but im hoping future patches will fix this problem. funniest pc game in a very long time, despite it being over a year old. r8 6/8 gr8 m8 get it. i have faith in rockstars dev team to fix these issues.",15.8

"im very positive about this game, we all know whats good about it. still some points that need attention: - combat is quite bad (especially if you played a lot of shooters) it feels clunky, slow, weird hit registration, annoying movement. - first person mode is a bit of a flop. it could have been made a lot better. - interface and keymapping is bad, just like any console port. having to press enter or moving your mouse to a small corner to confirm something doesnt work smooth. it just feels slow like on a console. (played gta5 on xbox360 for about 200 hours) combat was actually better on the 360, felt way more fluent.",20.4
"managed to get it working. is a good game would recomend",15.3
"even for a 2 years old game, i still excited. i play mostly online mode since ive done the story on console and i enjoyed it very much.. but, there are few things that annoy me: 1. sometimes on heists mission, when the mission failed and i tried to restart, the screen stuck on mission failed scene but the gameplay is still going on, so i have to change the resolution then change it back again which takes a lot of time.. 2. i bought a suppressor and extended clip for my pistol, but everytime i log in, its not equipped so i have to go to ammunation to equip it every single time.. 3. sometimes the game crashes well, i hope rockstar fix the game soon so i can enjoy it even more, great jobs rockstar for bringing this game to pc!",53.2

"just another open world rpg. only 3 classes that are almost the same and also have predefined races that cant be changed. skills level up by doing stuff like running. there is a main story line and a couple of side quests. but no boss fights, only trash mobs the whole game. you can buy a lot of items, but they dont have stats. weapons are mostly ranged and you will get in trouble using melee only. theres only one kind of armor that isnt even visible on the character. good thing so far, there are a lot of different mounts to ride. some of them can also fly but are destroyed quickly if you collide with the level geometry. setting could be interesting if youre bored with fantasy.",15.0

"simple. if you havent played gtav then you should.",65.0
"not only is the storyline immensely intriguing and immersive, but it is fairly long as well. the missions are comical, alluring, and ing fun. the game also has great replay ability. simply put, the game is worth the $59.99, and is a must-have, especially when it goes on sale for summer.",78.5

"great game. great online. all people from the age of 16, this is the game for you.",33.4
"my eyes... simply stunning to behold, movie quality viewing and gameplay; the cost is hard drive space (60 gb), real money (40), and needing a beast pc to run it well. ive not noticed any major league bugs since playing, and as yet have just been playing through the story mode so havent seen the online content (i will update my review once ive had a chance to check it out). if youve played gta iv (which is good), then you will love gta v (which is better!).",18.7
"this game is having massive lag issues. plus people are abusing the car insurance. i keep getting people in armored cars that camp people as they spawn and your only option is to use a rocket launcher to kill them. the  part is you have to pay for it. so you blowing up someones car costs you.",45.4

"edit: changed my vote to negative cause at least i had a problem with the game where it wouldnt progress anymore. there were no more missions at all so i never got to finish the game. last gta4 i wasnt able to finish it either cause the game had a problem with the usb logitech keyboard i had and the guy wouldnt climb up the helo. this is my last time buying gta games. they arent even my style anyway. open world for nothing cause missions are very linear. only good thing i have to say about the game is that online is fun and the game looks more modern than gta4. believe me i wanted to like it. i tried my best to get rid of that bug. but, in the end it seamed not even worth it. funny cause there are so many people out there on console with this same problem and they havent fixed it. ill change the review as soon as they fix it or i find a fix.",27.9

"lets keep it short and simple. singleplayer is great. the story is interesting. there are three different characters with very distinctive personalities that you can control. their have their own missions as well as missions where they work togheter. theres also a lot of things you can do in this game, it feels like its a mix of sim city, payday and need for speed. now, the multiplayer... its great except for the long loading times. you rank up and unlock stuff you can buy, like weapons, attachments, car mods... you can buy your own house, store your cars in the garage. you can play heists with your friends or randoms, you can get killed while you are wandering around los santos. its weird at the beggining, you will feel lost, but once you understand how the multiplayer works, it becomes an addiction. so... the game is totally worth your money. normal price for an aaa title and it gives your hours and hours of fun. not like these ubisoft overpriced and overhyped games that last 20 hours or so.",71.3
"my computer is bare minimum spec for this game, however the physics and the game runs great with no lagg at all, graphics look pretty bad but the game is very very playable. thanks rockstar for gearing down the graphics properly and ensuring it playable. i will probably update this once i upgrade my computer... awaiting parts :)",15.9
"this game is ing awesome, but its glitchy and the players are s/trolls. its also already got hackers in it, mostly just people getting infinite money and rp which i really dont give a  about, however i found out some are doing much more when my tank was instantly blownup from an smg shot (im scared what the future holds if this is already here). the glitched are pretty bad too, i have had issues with everything from crahing and getting achievements i didnt do (i have the lvl 100 achiev and im lvl 71..) all the way to being white screened for eternity during heists and being forced to restart. even with all this ery, im still having fun, the game is still a ing blast and ill continue to play it i reccomend this game but please understand the games current state before you purchase.",40.2

"grand theft auto is a video game thats based around its title. its a open world game based on american satire and crime you play as four characters for the sole goal of retriving the american dream. the four characters include you, a online character that takes place before the events of the three other characters. you can get drunk, get high, have sex, crash, die, become a terrorist, take selfies, die, have fun, buy a house, make yourself your american dream. now lets get serious do not play this game unless you have the absolute requirements, minimal isnt enough, even slightly above minimal. this is a next gen title that i expected it would play perfectly fine, but it nearly didnt play at all during my first time playing it. i highly recommend to invest on buying a ton of upgrades, and this game. at the same time. its a fun game i enjoy, and you should take a look at it too.",13.9

"i heard you like loading screens, so we put abunch of em in. in all seriusnes though, some poor lobby choises, like friendslist and crew mates being your preferded team members. so you might be fighting your friends in several game modes. but hey, nothing like shoting a friend in the butt. and all the loading, god all the loading. why cant we accept an invite, stay in freemode untill the game is launched. atleast have that as an option.",62.9

"so everything is better then the console versions of this from xbox 360 to ps4 this is a great game even if your not interested in the online but cmon we all know thats why you want it. only downside is when alt tabbed the game decides it doesnt want to reopen when using programs like ts, skype and ventrilo but thats not that bad.",49.3
"port is good but not fantastic.there are also random lag spikes when driving,memory leak issue is horrible(game eats up 4 gb of ram after 2 hours of playing),game crashes randomly during missions when pulling out weapons in first person mode,game also crashes randomly when switching to a different character and a few more.i would recommend this game (sort of) to other players because rockstar can patch these issues.",9.0

(much better than console which is gritty-360) the fps gameplay is definitely immersive, this game is worth the $60. not only will the story take you long enough, but going online just adds an infinite amount of additional gameplay hours. play by yourself, with a friend, or a stranger and youll have a great time!",13.6

"hi, iam really sorry if my english is bad bear with it. good now lets review this game. first the graphics the best i have seen in a long time you can see that they put in a lot of work in it with all the option to change this is a game that will run on a lot of configs. second, the gameplay is good i had a lot of fun playing around in general. third, the story is simple but fun rare are the game that go screwball wich for me is not a bad thing at all. finally the community now here is the big problem the community is complete s*** litle kids going around killing every body shouting in the lobby and to following the plan during heist. in conclusion this game is worth the wait the story, gameplay and graphics are good but it has a  community i rate 8.7/10",40.0

"so everything is better then the console versions of this from xbox 360 to ps4 this is a great game even if your not interested in the online but cmon we all know thats why you want it. only downside is when alt tabbed the game decides it doesnt want to reopen when using programs like ts, skype and ventrilo but thats not that bad.",49.3

"so despite the problems people were having, i experienced non. this game is truely remarkable and might i add, the best sandbox game currently out. gta v ultimately became, what gta iv was supposed to be. online is awesome, casually get my crew and start blasting people away with a rhino or just casually going for a drive. gta v has it all, the activities could be expanded though, but hopefully r* will add some more features in the future, with the anunciation on activities. and ofcourse the main event. heists. heists with a full crew makes it all the more better. and if rockstar will continue support for this game, itll last for years just like the cs games.",84.3
"i have been playing the xbox 360 version for over year and have been patient enough to wait for this game to come to pc (completely bypassing the next gen consoles). always love pc gaming and it is hard not to see why. the pc version of gta v is a master piece of open world free to do as you please with some stunning graphics. currently playing with the recommended graphics card gtx 660ti amp edition and i can run most the display setting high. cant wait to test it out with titan x when it arrives. this game has surpassed its predecessors and hope rockstar continues to keep up the good work regarding hackers in the online community, that completely ruined gta iv. i am disappointed when i still have to return to the xbox 360 and play with friends who have yet to experience the true taste of real gaming at its best. well done, nice port.",14.7
"one of the best games ive owned on steam so far. already clocked 57 hours on it. just the main story line alone was awesome! took me 24hrs to complete the main missions, but i still have tons of side missions to complete! multi-player is awesome as well even without friends. however, not everyone speaks english, thus there might be a problem when it comes to heists.",61.1
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played. the level of immersion in the story is very high as the dialogue makes it feel like an exaggerated stereotype of america. the graphics are very good, and even a mid-level pc can run this game on high/normal without any problems. buy this game now.",40.4

"it does have the same good features of the console version but youd need a very solid pc to run it efficiently. i particularly had problems with playing gta online. shame really as thats what i was looking forward to. my pc was made with gaming in mind but it struggles with this game. only purchase if you have the hardware to go for it. the recommended specifications are where your pc specs should be minimally. you have been warned!",1.1

"i have never played a more rounded game in my life. pin sharp graphics, cutting humour, brutal violence. shooting, driving, running, cycling, flying, diving, gold, tennis, darts, stocks and shares. its really all here! this is like the definative version of all the gtas to date. absolutely stunning, and im glad i waited for the pc version. keyboard and mouse is the way this game was meant to be played!",3.9

"i bought gta v for my 360 when it first came out and played it often. the disc hardly left the drive as i continued to enjoy the game all the way up to the pc release. i can honestly say its a whole new game on pc. the graphics are stunning! there are lots of new things and im still getting used to the first person view, which im starting to prefer on foot. now mods are starting to come out and im really going to enjoy breaking outside of the barriers imposed of what rockstar intended in this game. my advice for anyone looking at this and thinking i already played it on my console, is to try it on pc. its not what you played before, and you wont look back. sure the story is much the same, but the mechanics and sheer beauty of gta v pc raises the bar to a whole new, very high level for the gaming industry.",24.0
"this games is the greatest game ive played in a long time, and when i mean great i mean, feeling like a kid again great, has so much appeal. one of those games where you dont want to sleep, and you cant wait until you can play it again. the graphics and the preformance make this game an entirely new game up to date for the year, i never touched this game until pc release, now that i have it, it was well worth the wait.",4.9

"the game is overloaded with a content in the beginning. you are the kid in a confectionary. 10/10 the time has passed, youve realized the most of the content is pointless and has no value. a bit of disappointment. 8/10 the game has ended, the mighty rockstar has not done anything, which will make the game any better of a ubis yearly sandbox. 7,5/10 you have started the online, the first hour of the journey is amazing and you are the r*s believer once again. 8,5/10 the hours has gone in the online, and all you can see is only the bad things, the glitches, the mistakes for which a developer should be ashamed these days. 8/10 its not the destination thats important. its the journey. you are switching off the game and moving to the anabiosis until gta 6. 9/10",91.3
"well worth the wait. the graphics are amazing and even on launch day, the game was one of the most stable ive ever played. i have everything on high (2600mb/2000mb vram usage) and i pretty much get a solid 60fps. this game is beautiful and fun. im just sad that san fierro and las venturas arent in it. perhaps well see some dlc or mods.",33.0

"i wasnt going to buy this game but i got a bit curious about the firstperson mode. anyways after playing a bit and doing some heists i find it pretty funny. although not as much solo mission content in the multiplayer part overall ill give it 8/10 due to the upgraded graphics and the 1st person mode. woulda been a 9 if it didnt crash occationally",38.3

"with me personally being a massive fan of open world games and specificly mafia ii. once i had played the game a few times on a ps3 and it was good but for some reason its so much better on pc. there really are very little faults with the game but not everygame is perfect",67.6
"joy at last! its finally working, been playing for over an hour and theres been no problems! (touch wood!) before it wouldnt last long enough to finish the first mission. now there seems to be stability. from what i can tell there have been two issue affecting my experience. 1) nvidia experience set all the opimal settings to way over my gfx cards capabilities and instantly put the settings in the red (on the game graphics-in-game-settings had me using over a gig above the spec of my gtx 760 2gb, i7, 16gb while we are at it). 2) downloading the game, i repeatedly found errors in the downloaded file according to steams cache checking utility. even when it was repaired the game would crash. today i finally downloaded it with no errors when checking it prior to installation (this is only time this has happened in over four downloads) and its the first time its run perfectly. after all that trouble i can say that it has been worth the annoyance but i could have done with out it. ok now let the scally waggery commence!",26.7

"story mode was great. not much to tell, worth to buy just for online play! online is really fun untill you get to a certain point were the game just gets kinda boring, not much to do. try getting as many friends as possible or join crews to do stuff together. as in planning heists, team deathmatches etc etc. overall, run around and kill people, and have fun. rate 8/10 for both story mode and online. there are more serious reviews out there, no hate please. :*",81.7
