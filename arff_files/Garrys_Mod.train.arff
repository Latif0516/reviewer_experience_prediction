"i like this game it look so  a first when i played it i could not stop",58.8
"considering i have almost 1000 hours played on gmod, i think it is safe to say that this game is fantastic! it is by far my most played game. this game is so great because there are so many gamemodes. if you get bored of one then just play another!",1713.6
"when i first bought this, my friend said not a game, bro. he was right. its not a game. it is your world. do with it what you wish.",55.3
"you dont know what you are missing out on...definitely the most expandable and ever-changing mod i have ever played. i normally get bored of games pretty quickly, but hence the amount of playtime i have with this, it has never ceased to stop entertaining me. the community is very diverse, and depending on what directions you take you will probably find your niche easy. some of the gamemodes play like they could be a game just by themselves, but in any means you can never get bored if you keep trying new things. and singleplayer/sandbox is already perfect enough in that matter, if you find the loading times worth it. very developer-friendly too, it uses lua and as time goes on more and more hooks are being updated and added. definitely worth a script-kiddies time.",2254.3
"garrys mod is one of the best source mods ever made! definately worth buying",265.7
"this is the best game i have and i have 86 games. thats how good this game is.",597.2
"custiomization and spawning. back then in our group, rps (some kind of storyline making but with real time spawning)were hosted in a social site called whirled, but now gmod has completely taken over whirleds role as our rp platform. however despite gmod has some flaws, its pros outweight its cons.",405.0
"whether you want to build a nice community of npcs and have tea-time with them every tuesday, or whether you want to create havoc with randomness and weapons, garrys mod, commonly known as gmod, is the one that will make it all true. garrys mod choses you fellow players, to get this game. so get it now! or prepare to be killed by flying tires and watermelon-wielding shovels. anyway, this is an awesome game! :)",3.5
"ever since i saw gassymexican and seananners play gmod i would say i was hooked on it right when i saw the gameplay i highly recomend you get this game",648.6
"totally worth it. endless possibilities and gamemodes",2036.4
"this game is legitimately awesome, and you do virtually anything in it. i recommend this to everyone who loves to have fun.",104.6
"garrys mod is fun for a while if you dont mind griefers and screaming kids in multiplayer. once it gets boring you can have a lot more fun by installing wiremod addon.",27.3
"a must-have for any pc gamer. the possiblities in this game are endless, making it the best sandbox game around.",173.4
"great game but there should be a help key that tells u evrey thing about the tool your holding",50.7
"what i dont like about the game is that its too... sandbox-ish. dont get me wrong, i love sandbox games. ones with a goal; which garrys mod doesnt have. now, this is great for someone who wants to create a game, but its boring for everyone else. most of the fun is on multiplayer, though i still think it can get boring after a while. really, youll find yourself just fooling around with the different tools and objects you can use. thats about it. + lots of add-ons + lots of great servers + lots of customisation - no goal (at all) - relies too much on add-ons - sucks in singleplayer this game is okay. though i really dont consider it something ill always find myself playing. 6.5 / 10",2.4
"ive only played a few minutes. its alright i guess.",1347.7
"i like the freedom of making your own freedom how u can make your guns gets other people guns and making gamemodes of other thing u like do any thing of other thing u like",854.6
"do you like fps ? do you want to express your imagination ? this games for you !",1421.6
"endless games, modes, and mods! imagene bill gates kicking hitler in da balls!",243.2
"this game is a lot of fun! all of the different gamemodes like ttt, murder , prop hunt etc. make for a lot of hours of fun. i love it how in almost every server there are a lot of funny people and i couldnt play a round of any gamemode without laughing because not only the game but also the people that play it are really funny (well, most of them, the others are s).",60.0
"that game is awesome. i bought it before 3 years maybe and i own a server , my play time is 1058. and thats actually funny, because this game has several user made game modes and i played some of them and after a time (after 1000 hours :)) everyone of these gamemodes went boring. i thought i played already every existing game mode, but now, after garrys mod 13 and the game mod screen i realised i didnt play every game mode. this game never gets boring. if you wanna build, go on sandbox, if you wanna shoot go on stronghold, if you wanna rp go on rp,... i am waiting till 1500 hours",1105.5
"1. spawned 20 chairs in one another. 2. game crashed. 3. tried it again. 4. game crashed. i r8 9/8 m8 dont h8.",356.2
"its like minecraft, but it made my teets really hard.",16.6
"only played a little bit of the game, but so far, its got a lot to offer. i could see myself playing a bit more, but thats it. think ill keep it at a small play time.",1460.9
"one of the most open and enjoyable games you will ever play. you think it you can create it in gmod. its a huge community driven experience and its still being played 7 years after it became a fully fledged game. you will need the rest of the source games to fully enjoy gmod, but providing you do its a blast. make anything, do anything and get shouted at by 12 year olds from russia while you do it. also theres that ttt thing, thats popular and fun. for its normal price or the amazingly low steam sale prices gmod is a game you will not regret buying, unless that is that you want to get something done, its kinda good at stealing time away.",378.5
"really funny game , intresting , creative and there are some more things i will not spoiler , i will let you check this !! there are more mods for example : -zmod (dayz) -garrys mod tower (requieres download) -surf -deathrun the others are cool but i will not spoiler !",73.4
"garrys mod is one of the best games i have ever played, for ten dollars it is a great price. this game has endless possabillities.",51.6
"tons of gamemodes,tons of maps,infinite fun&possibilities guaranteed.i recommend this with all my heart. 11/10",27.9
"this game is the most dankest, lord gaben taught me how to quickscopez on dis. 420/10",1378.1
"i honestly cant say anything bad about this game. its fun. its creative. its damn funny!",851.7
"mmmmmmmmmmmmm dis game is soooo good. if you dont buy and play this game you truly have no soul. my hours say all in this review 212 hours is a very long time. 9.99 is the best price for this game for how much replayability it holds. and captain dont like this review i will defriend you if you do.",302.7
"hands down the best game ever all i need is this game and no else",748.1
"the game modes are fun. like for example when i was playing prop hunt, i would keep taunting leeeerrrrrrroyyyyy jeenkins!!",144.0
"i am sorry peeps. i just dont like this game. you need half life 2 ans counterstrike source to see all the textures. some of the servers in garrys mod just use those textures and i dont want to pay $10 to $25 just so i can get this game working fully. something else i hate about the game is it eats away at your computer just so it can run properly. now my minecraft, battlefield, dont starve, arma 3, the walking dead and league of legends lag soo much. i have uninstalled garrys mod and it is still trying to uninstall it for about 10 minutes now. i rate this game a 3/10",344.8
"overall, this game is hours of entertainment waiting to happen. with its large community, theres a large amount of content you can add, many friendly gamers, and tons of different things you can do with a variety of game modes. sometimes it might take a lot of creativity, but you can almost do anything with this game, making it extremely worthwhile.",852.7
"so entertaining and fun, defo a game spending some time on :)",42.0
"killed a detective in ttt, as a detective. receives nerd rage by 9-year-olds on how i suck at life. would kill detective again. 10.9/10",28.6
"quite complicated when you first get it, but youll learn alonfg the way. however, you will need counter strike: source to have the proper textures for everything, or else many objects and walls will be purple checkboards or huge error symbols. ttt is a good gamemode to play/ if you dont have counter strike source, i would recommend playing on minecraft servers. you can just type in minecraft in the search bar. gmod is overall a great game though.",656.4
"this game is epic because this can do anything you like and make some awesome screenshot . oh yeah and this game has many mods because this game is called gmod",114.3
"as someone who has steam you owe it to yourself to buy this game along with the orange box. ive dumped so many hours into this game and i know you wont regret your purchases.",1177.7
"gmod... best place to find minges 5/5 would recommend.",372.5
"1. buy the game. 2. get any girl/boy you want. 3. make yourself a bacon sandwich, perhaps one for your gmod character also, there may be a mod for that. there seems to be one for everything. 4. play the game, maybe murder, ttt, prop hunt or even dark rp. 5. forget what the outside world looks like. 6. youre now a hermit, youre welcome.",118.0
"a must-play game that is something to enjoy. gmod is a sandbox based game with multiple gamemodes. such as murder, trouble in terriost town, darkrp, prop hunt, and many more. 10/10",374.6
"supr dupr fun u bst b getin it nao bfor i got to eat ur cat and u wil crie becuz cats r butifull and is silly",373.9
"lets you swim in melons and explosive tanks. 10/10",1116.7
"a humorous level builder and a great extension to the half-life series. garrys mod is user friendly when it comes to customization, animation and modifying bits and pieces from other games that you own! just dont forget to save.",243.5
"horrible. this game is absolute rubbish. a waste of time and money. i cant believe i even got this game. lets start of with concept......oh wait..theres no concept! this game is some dumb randomness. you just do whatever the heck you want. and theres no game saves so you cant save your progess or nothing. jeez. it takes 20 minutes to join one server. thats right. 20 minutes! this game, sure it can be a lot of fun some times. but a lot of times...it just gets old. i do not think this game is worth 10 whole dollars. i personally think this game should be free to play. do you know why? because it sucks. period. haters will be reading this. so haters hate away all you want in the comments.",9.9
"sandbox to the extreme! this is not a game, this can be any game you want!",135.6
"heck yeh cool bro and i will call it ..                  / / hurry get to the chopper!",523.5
"this is one of the best sandboxs out there due to its wide range on creativity in this game. you can build cars and buidlings or play it like an fps. please note that this game is screwed without counter strike source so i recommend you get the package. please also nite the more vaulve games you have, like portal half life improves your compatibilaty with online game servers. i give this 9.5/10",201.7
"fun game, lots of mods. oh and the community is still strong online, just mind the squeakers.",917.3
"great game but the counter strike source pack is a must thats what makes it fun",73.4
"here imagination reaches whole new level...here you can nuke anything,build,destroy and eventually crash game! 1000/10",102.3
"highly recomend great game tuns of game mode overall best game to have fun :d",1263.1
"so many mods... a game meant to last forever, my favorite game next to team fortress 2.",9.3
"coolness my awesomeness is upgrade to mega fun for real!",476.8
"simply awesome, really funny, really fun would recommend, one of the best games ive ever played 9.8/10",104.4
"with so many gamemodes and physics tools, this sandbox game is excellent value for money at the price. roleplay servers are popular, things like cops and robbers, half-life 2 roleplay, and build mode servers. if its on sale, pick it up, but keep in mind that the gameplay you get out is completely reliant on what you put in. this isnt a guided experience, this is creativity, and improvisationally based stuff.",2030.8
"perfect sandbox with great community, but sometimes (always) garry breaks things with new update.",1845.3
"i really love this game. the added workshop makes it 100 times better.",39.0
"its freaking awesome id wish this is my only game but i have more",140.0
"lots of fun to play with friends and just mess around. thumbs up.",42.8
"its a great game but its hard to find the right textures for most of the maps.",9.9
"surprisingly great. amazing game. its a great sandbox game one of the best for sure easily ties with minecraft at the very least. you would have to be stupid not to give it a try. the mods are great and reliable workshop items as well. anything can happen in this game literally.",64.2
"i come with a warning: dont buy this game unless youve got the money to buy counter strike source. i havent come across a single way i can play this game without it. i think its actually rather crappy that youre given the option to buy it without counter strike source as its seemingly a waste of money and space without it.",0.3
"so its a sandbox with many different game modes like rp, construct, sled gang wars etc, in my opinion you should try rp because its like a simulator of the real life.",1061.3
"fun game for people that want to mess around and make creations or if youre not good at that play one of the many multiplayer game modes that this game offers. only annoying thing is that you need the css content or your textures and models will be kind of ed.",2096.9
"gmod is one of the best games ive ever played if not the best, extremely enjoyable if you use some mods like acf for example and make a tank or darkrp. 10/10",1587.2
"i found this very hard to masturbe to, but is a cool game",419.9

"for anyone who likes indie or sandbox games like me, i have 2 things to say. 1)you have a great taste in games 2)i would say that gmod is the sandbox game. garrys mod is incredibly fun and versatile with different gamemodes. it is the top sandbox/indie game ive ever played, and could easil represent the entire genre. get it!",175.0
"5 spent on this amazing game i recommed it to people who like playing with friends it includes everything i would want a game to have!",281.9
"an okayish game pros: -best workshop stuff ever -gamemodes -make a bathtub rocket cons: -worst workshop stuff ever -horrible gamemodes -rockets give you seizures 3/10 wouldnt play an extra +600 hours ever again",699.3
"ultimately, this is the greatest game ive ever got, this is the most clean standalone source mod ive ever played. in this game you can put ragdolls, pose them, kill them, hold them a thing, etc. also theres lots of fun gamemodes. story: 10/10 - as if theres no story, you are one who builds up the fun. controls: 10/10 -  up controls, that is the way. graphics: 8/10 - i just love the awesome logo and also the hud. music: 5/10 - even if i just loved this game, theres no music, but in some gamemodes or servers, there is. gameplay: 10/10 - wow. such ragdolls. much fun. very mod. total: 4.3/5",77.2
"awesomely addicting! i recommed this to anyone. (a life is not required)",442.4
"this game is the sandbox game to own. it has an overwhelming number of gamemodes, addons, mods, and just about anything you can think of. you want to play a tdm gamemode? fine, thats here. you want to build a walking mech with random people? go for it. you want to parkour around a good-sized city with a bunch of tag gamemodes? yup, got that too. for $10, i cant really think of a reason not to buy it, or if the price is too steep for you, it frequently goes on sale for $2.49, which hopefully you can dish out by selling trading cards, or scrap on tf2. 10/10, would <everything> again.",80.4

"garrys mod is a simulator game where it is made for you to add mods and with its many gamemode like ttt or prop hunt you will have your you holiday break playing this game. i am however annoyed about the texture pack problem. where you have to have the game inorder to have the textures ready.",86.2
"this game right off the bat is awesome i think anyone who likes to be creative or just shoot some npcs this is the game for you it has so many possibilities i would go as far to say they are endless so in conclusion this game is fun",582.6
"i have almost 800 hours on this game. i think you know what my review is.",1248.7
"this game is something very different compared to other games. it may be a bit laggy if you go crazy with the addons, but if you have tf2 or hl2 or games like that it may make it faster, along with adding more stuff in. anyways, this is a great time-passer.",51.8
"garrys mod is a game that has always got something to do. want to make an awesome boat? you can. want to kill people? thats what ttt is for. want to stop humanity in real life? well you cant. sorry. 10/10",458.8

"a real bunch of laughs for everyone who plays it, garrys mod is a true piece of art. whether you are new to this genre or a seasoned professional, i reccomend this game to everyone. you can create wonderful contraptions, glorious views or, if this does not appeal to you, just plain and simple beating the crap out of random objects and npcs. there are thousands of modifications to the vanilla game, like extra maps, vehicles and weapons. so many weapons. so, in conclusion, wonderful game. the only real downside is that it tends to crash a lot if you have a lot of addons. despite the downsides, i rate this game an 8.5/10.",344.0

"as someone that doesnt find build anything you want games to be fun i really could care less about the sandbox potential, and even if i did, the physics engine, like many others, doesnt exactly work well with the concept of precision and newtons laws of motion (the main issue being how objects in motion in gmod interact with npcs and player characters in a less-than-relativistic fashion). with that all said, however, the ability for the community to create custom game modes has resulted in a lot of interesting, fun and somewhat unique multiplayer experiences, which include trouble in terrorist town, jailbreak, dark rp, just to name some of the more popular ones.",88.8

"this game is a must-have for those who seek creativity and ideas.........",14.4
"honestly im in between yes and no. but at the end of the day it has to be no, dont get me wrong this game is amazing. its the community that is garbage. all the servers are either filled with children that scream into the microphones, 25 year olds just repededly saying kos ___  or admin ban him. this game is amazing its the community that is corrupt. well most of it, there is that sliver of hope on the smaller servers where people are actually nice. overall i wouldnt recommend if you are looking forward to the online aspect but to look for the lan play.",318.9

"havent even got to play a single match other than singleplayer sandbox due to the amount of  there is to download, judging by the other comments this game is a shell of its former self, maybe there is something underneath worth the 10 hours to get into one server but i am not prepared to sit and wait for that long im afraid, for the forementioned reasons i simply cannot reccomend this game. as always, hope for the best but expect the worst -axon magnus-",1.3

"this game is fun for me. its more like a game where you decide what happens. its actually a game, model tester, and animator (if you do it right). but if youre the kind of player that just likes to mess around and not take games very seriously, this is the game for you. you can get all kinds of models of characters from any game you have on steam, or the addons, and do whatever you want with them. you can get weapons, skins, props, tools, all random stuff. you can even get achievements just for playing the game! so if you like to play games, and play them your way, i highly recommend garrys mod. :3",412.2

"this game, this bloody game. im going to talk in the context of just playing murder and trouble in terrorist town. this game is a trolls paradise! it has the ability to ruin friendships signified by the stout trust one places in another. it basically is betrayer simulator. the joy one feels when your friend readily accepts you as an innocent, only to obliterate him in the back of the head with your shotgun. brains all over the place. even now my hands shake, as i just want to be a traitor again and murder everyone in a blissful dance :d :d :d :d",87.7

"extremely fun to play, the limits of creativity are not hindered in any way and it allows you to create anything you can think of. one of my favourtite games on steam so far and its worth every penny. the servers are great to play on, since you can make new friends and have a heck of a great time. the addons from the community are spectacular since it adds even more to the game and allows even more stuff to be added and also not to forget the requirements to run the game are very low allowing nearly everyone to play and have great time with a framerate over 30fps. i give this game a thumbs up.",184.6

"garrys mod is the diamond in the stone of all video games today. lots of games are built upon the promise of the endless possibilities of your imagination, but truth is, thats not entirely true. garrys mod is your imagination, itself. do whatever you want to do. fight ninja donuts on a steamship, throw strawberry-infused sunglasses at a flying purple xbox, have a balloon fight dance party with the president. whatever you can imagine, its possible with garrys mod.",1167.9

"a silly game, often without objective, save for a few popular types like trouble in terrorist town and prop hunt. even though it is often a poorly coordinated mish mash without the use of voice chat, some games can be fun if people communicate. the rest of the game consists of children who scream a lot or abusive teenagers with a bad attitude. i wouldnt recommend it for mature gamers or people seeking something fullfilling or worthy of playing often. most, if not all of the fun factor comes not from the game itself but the ability to entertain yourself (at least in the majority of modes).",0.6

"another steam necessity, anyone can find enjoyment in this game, from simply using it as a way to practise fighting enemies or for creating complex and exciting contraptions with the large and expanding toolset provided by garry and the countless modders taking advantage of the handy lua system that has been implemented into the game. with countless gamemodes, maps and things to do this wont get boring quickly. the recent changes have made installing mods much simpler and possible within the game so big thanks to garry for continuing to maintain this excellent game.",282.6

"no matter where i run this game from, what internet provider i use, or pc (gaming or regular) it has tons of problems. the most frequent problem on all computers ive played this on is that when you start it you cant click anything or minimize the window. the only way out is to restart your pc. several times it automatically restarts gmod and gets me stuck on the same screen right after i restart/shut down my pc. in my exerience this is often times unplayable than it is playable.",80.2
"a very fun game with and without mods, easily one of the better sandbox games out there. theres a huge range of options for different people, from building enthusiasts to machinima makers. the experience gets better when mods are enabled, which adds even more variety. multiplayer is also great, as you get to interact with fellow players and make friends. the price of the game isnt bad either, costing only $9.99, with prices as low as $2.49 during sales. however, there are some faults in the game, mainly lua errors, but theyre not too major. the selection of maps in the vanilla game is very bland as well. gripes aside, i highly recommend garrys mod, its worth every single cent.",671.2

"gmod... where to begin? there is so much you can do. i have 15 hours logged already and thats on the murder playmode alone. so much fun. basically, theres one murderer with a knife (which he can also throw) and everyone else is a bystander. one bystander starts with a gun which you use to kill the murderer. it has to reload after one shot. (the murderer obviously has to kill all the bystanders). you can also find 5 green-glowing props around the map to get yourself a gun. just one of the many gamemodes in gmod. rating: 10/10 definitely would recommend to everyone. i usually play for story. i dont even play fps games online like that but wow gmod is addicting.",57.0

"as with many sandbox games, it is what you make of it. my advice would be to get this game coupled with counter strike source (to stop missing texture glitches) and try a bit of everything. ive met people who swear by sandbox single player. personally, i have found jailbreak and ttt to be some of the most enjoyable gaming experiences to date. many features are missing, but it is excellent for its price. a must own.",133.4
"garrys mod is one of the most enjoyable games i own. with there being thousands upon thousands of mini games and servers to play on you will most likely never get bored. being able to build your own contraptions or custom maps is very entertaining and will let you be able to explore your creativity. the tools that you can used in the game make it very easy to accomplish that. not only that but you can have so many fun experiences with your friends in servers for hours at a time. so i highly recommend this to anybody who wishes to have all of that in one game.",48.6

"garrys mod... well, its kind of everything. you can do nearly everything (pending legality). i have some near 700 hours on record, i know people with more, and nobody has seen it all. its the quintessence of the sandbox genre, and really the epitome of what gaming can do. downloading other peers files can bring new experiences that will last and entertain for hours and hours and hours on end. and the price is cheap as  for the amount of value in the game, and trust me, there is a lot of value in the game. so what are you waiting for? go buy it. if you dont, i will dispatch a team of heavily-armed chimpanzees to make you buy it at gunpoint. so your choice. easy way, or the hard way.

"theres something for everybody in garrys mod. i reccomend downloading the gmod tower add on and any deathrun server. for me garrys mod is the very definition of a sandbox game. one simi annoying thing about garrys mod is that many servers expect you to have bought and installed other various valve games such as counter strike source and half life 2 episode 2. if you dont have every valve game installed you will eventually encounter servers with big red missing texture errors all over the place and pink and black checkboard epileptic textures.",458.7
"this game is great, it is a much better sandbox than minecraft will ever be. you can get any prop you could ever dream of, if you get bored of one thing there is always another, and it is, well, pointless. there is no objective, no end of the game. the only problem i have with this is you need to buy games to get a lot of textures but there are *ahem* ways to get around that, so overall great game.",924.1

"fun and entertaining. each game mode may be difficult to understand at first, but after a while you get the hang of it. the only downside to it is that it is difficult to play if you do not have the textures for the maps if you do not have the files for them. other than that it is a great game to buy and play with friends",627.6

"garrys mod (gmod) is quite a fun little indie sim, that requires you to do nothing and allows you to do anything! a love this game to bits and the community is pretty nice also. my only complaint: this game is pretty much useless without a source game like half-life 2 (ep 1 and 2) or counter-strike:source. but other than that, i would recommend this game to anyone who is bored of the mind-numbing money grabbing games and just wants to have fun!",77.3

"very good game. flexible, fun, and simple enough to settle down in a special community that you might stumble upon in the game. it might seem bare at first, but that is where the mod comes in. it lets you swap and add in new things for you to toy with, and the modding community seems to have no end in creating wonderful ideas to play around in.",769.2

"theres something for everybody in garrys mod. i reccomend downloading the gmod tower add on and any deathrun server. for me garrys mod is the very definition of a sandbox game. one simi annoying thing about garrys mod is that many servers expect you to have bought and installed other various valve games such as counter strike source and half life 2 episode 2. if you dont have every valve game installed you will eventually encounter servers with big red missing texture errors all over the place and pink and black checkboard epileptic textures.",458.7
"fantastic game! like minecraft, the choices in this game are endless, but unlike minecraft, this game is loads more mature, in the matter of content, not the actual gameplay. i recommend buying this with counter strike : source for better visuals on servers, or even get the valve complete pack for loads of other things. - cheers",689.7
"overall great game for the common gamer. though you need a source engine like counter strike:source, its worth it. a nice sandbox for you to get creative in, and if you are not satisfied, there are gamemodes to suit your needs! workshop products made by users really connect us and make the game a moer enjoyable experience.",345.6

"well to start off its a funny game with lots of creativity but i dont find the online experience as good as say battlefield, left 4 dead, and minecraft. i think the game is meant more for people who want to make small video games and movies. i do like however how they add ttt (trouble in terrorist town) to the game allready so you dont have to download it :) but whoever thought of the idea to make this game i want to give them one big brofist :d",333.2
"garrys mod has blown up to be so strong and full of support, it can practically be any game ever made. this sandbox toolkit allows the building of completely awesome structures and devices and the creation of awesome game modes using .lua file structures. in other words: fun. want to play racing like mariokart? there are servers for that. want to act like a homeless person in a city? there are servers for that. do you want to play something like quake? you guessed right, more servers. the possibilities with garrys mod in the future is great. admitingly, the source engine is starting to lose some of its luster as far as graphics go. still, garrys mod is a solid buy.",1427.0
"i can spawn watermelons and i was killed by a cash register. yep. 10/10",43.4
"to simply put this, completely un-simple and simple game, it is a huge and amazing game, that still has yet to get better, but then after addons, things will get interesting... -ly fun! you can build beautiful trains, cars, building, cannons, lazers, et cetera, etc, etc. servers and mechanics can be horrible for most, including lag, lerp, and a few severe losses of fps, but overall better than a game. 9.5/10",1115.3

"its a sandbox editor..so you can pretty much do anything you want with the source engine, even go online and play many different game modes that the community has made, like zombie survival, racing, even a quake 3 arena mod<<< now that mode took me back to the hardcore days. theres even a cinema game mode or some sort where players can get together and watch a bunch of random youtube or other video sharing site at the same time, and that was a very interesting experience in my point of view. you can pretty much do anything with the source engine nowadays. so yea, buy this game and have fun. theres really no rules here.",189.4

"clearly another game that wasnt made for me! garrys mod may be a fun game along you use the addons made by the community, because the sandbox single player is tedious. from what i have played didnt enjoyed too much, and there is 2 main factors: the community and the time you take too download the addons on each server. the community are very immature - bit like call of duty - if you dont know how to play the ban you, the laugh at you argh... and the time we take too download all the addons is tedious. it has a lot of games mode like, trouble terrorist town (ttt), survival but still i did not like it. we all have our opinions, and mine is this game is bad. ps: bring all the hate you want! ~ 5/10",2.8
"a great game with a lot of game modes ranging from sandbox, trouble in terrorist town (ttt), prop hunt and many more !!! sandbox is mainly where one uses creativity to build and goof around for entertainment. ttt is where one uses deception and detective skills to win the game. then theres prop hunt where the hunters must find and eliminate the props who are hiding, taking hide and seek to the next level. and so much more game modes to explore! this game is better off with a friend or two to witness all your funny moments. this game will certainly make you spend hours of gameplay and not get bored of it.",592.5

"i highly recommend this game, due to its great multiplayer, hilarious physics, and decent graphics. it is fun to play singleplayer, but even more fun to play multiplayer. the only downside to multiplayer is the server restrictions. some servers have huge restrictions that make the server boring and no fun to play on, while other servers allow you to do whatever you please. another reason i recommend this game is the mods. mods dont ruin the fun like mods in some other games. but instead, the mods enhance the singleplayer, and multiplayer if the server owner is running them. overall, if i were to give this game a rating, it would be an 8.5/10. the game is really enjoyable.",305.2

"this is my revised review for garrys mod. in my opinion, garrys mod is the best bang for your buck game on all of steam. for 10 usd you get a game with great gamemodes, community support, and hundreds of hours of fun. i myself have hundreds of hours and have never gotten bored.here are some pros and cons. pros -dozens of fun gamemodes -very cheap (10 usd) -best workshop on steam, there are new cars, tools, maps, etc... -pretty good graphics cons -not free -doesnt come wrapped in gold",459.3

"honestly there is not a good reason to not own this game. the only problem is cs:s textures and you can download the textures, or just buy the game. the game lives with mods ranging from the humor and fun of darkrp to the suspenceful and shocking moments of ttt to haning out with friends in the theather mode watching funny memes on youtube beacuse you are afraid to leave your home to the endless possibilities of sandbox mode. this game has something for everybody. its like a wholesome family movie 10/10 a must have title",548.8

"i like it, but theyre still trying to sham you by making you have to buy cs:source or one of the other games to get the game fully suited up for textures. a lot of the mechanics are also buggy and odd, and at most times it feels as if ive been assigned to build the white house when im trying to make a vehicle.",24.7

"much better than minecraft 10/10 gmod is basically a sandbox game,fortunatly it isnt only sandbox. there are a lot of gamemodes to play for example darkrp,ttt (trouble in terrorist town),zombie gamemodes and a lot more. this game uses the half life 2 engine so it will basically be a mod for half life 2. this game is a really fun one i recommend this to all peeps who have steam.",442.0

"i bought this game to play prop hunt, but i became addicted to trouble in terrorist town. the communities are fantastic, on the whole, and they make you feel welcome. all in all, a great online multiplayer experience. counter strike source is recommended too, for extra textures and content. i have yet to play with the actual sandbox properly, but i will leave that to the pros. i am having too much fun with whats already out there.",179.4

"no more blood plz but i like the awesome mods you can get and i like the fact that you can blow heads up!!!",39.0
"my favourate game on steam. you cant make much ingame due to sandbox being extremely limited and you can only load the saves you made inside of sandbox mode taking the point away. but make stuff for this game in source sdk and lua and the possibilities become litterally endless, can be played in steam offline mode which is an absolute necessity. only wish garry would stop breaking the game every new update",503.1
"garrys mod. whats not to like about it? it is literally a game in which you play games and do whatever the hell you want! i have nothing bad to say about this game at all. im writing this review to tell you that if you dont have it get it and if you were to only get one game i would totally recommend garrys mod. im not going to list the pros because it would take forever. but for those of you who do have it i know you agree with me when i say this game is totally worth the ten dollars spent on the game. i rate this game 11/10",50.0

"great game and i would even say its the ultimate sandbox game. great content and awsome gameplay.",113.9
"there was a time when garrys mod reigned supreme, but thanks to the gmod 13 update it has been thoroughly ruined. the inventory, maps, physics, community, addon system, and virtually every aspect you can think of has been made worse by an order of magnitude. only one thing which garry succeeded in was attracting the tf2 crowds in mass numbers. once there were building communities which would build together in unison, now most are disbanded and replaced by deathrun servers and other lame gamemodes because the art of building has been stifled.",2008.0
"gmod is one of the most fun that i have ever had with a game. the last time i had this much fun is when i bought half life. in gmod there is community created maps, weapons, tools, npcs, and vehicles that you can download and put in your game. here is some things that i have done,  rockets, giant robots, port a potties, ridable bicycles, a dismemberment map for ragdolls, and my favorite, murder gamemode and zombie/combine invasion. you may need half life 2, half life 2 episodes 1 and 2 and counter strike source for most of the stuff to work. but like i said, i love gmod and you should all try it.",984.1
"overall, this is an excellent game. a great choice for anyone who loves source games and trying something different. the game modes are fantastic and ttt is by far the best ive played. there is also great downloadable content and there is always something new to look forward to everytime you play this game. this game should be nominated for a joystiq award for 2014 and all props definitely go to garry newman for the great idea and game that more than a million people absolutely enjoy playing including myself!",28.9
"the game is great! i wish it had never switched over to gmod 13 though. gmod12 and older were more stable and way more fun to expirience things with. but the game is not bad at all! sandbox is where its all at!",1768.3

"i bought this game for $2.50 when it was on sale (im a bit of a liberal spender...), and its been great! the game is mostly community content and borrowed items from other games, which is cool for a good while. but thats just if youre using single player sandbox... when you start playing on servers, the amazing amount of official server mods, such as melon bomber, jailbreak, ttt, fireart, its even better. its a good game. a lot of the community content and servers require you to own games, mostly counter-strike: source (hence the gamepack on sale here.), but if you look around the internet, you can get the gamefiles easily without having to buy the game. note: you dont get the game for having the gamefiles, just the gmod content.",22.0

"yes! get this game asap. if your mind imagines it in the g-mod world, its definately possible.",152.7

"garrys mod is a fun game. not only is it a game, but it includes many fun gamemodes in it. my favorite are prophunt and ttt(trouble in terrorist town). or you can go with the classic garrys mod and build random creations. in game, there are textures that may be missing or unloadable because you need other games for it to function 100% correctly. one of these games is counter strike: souce needed for ttt. other than this, it is a game that gives you a lot of bang for your buck.",126.7
"garrys mod is one of those games that never gets boring! every month it seems someone makes an interesting concept to this game. all with custom gamemodes being always made, classic sandbox and fun online experience! i would strongly recommend buying this game as soon as possible! you wont regret it!",442.9

"youve seen the silly animations on youtube, youve seen the lets plays by famous online gamers and you probably have no interest in any other aspect of this game other than trouble in terrorist town, but its garrys mod and its popular, i like it, its a great sandbox shooter for the sorts of things i like doing on video games 9.9/10 its gmod",545.7

"this is just tremendously fun. at the mere price of $10 (and an accompanying source game, but if youre on steam, you probably have one of them already), this is probably the most value ive ever gotten from a game. the core game is great for faffing about, but the add-ons (all free!) are where it really gets fun. want to race a lamborghini around dustbowl? go ahead! want to have a giant hatsune miku beat up godzilla with a crowbar? make it happen! and if theres some crazy idea you have that somebody else hasnt had already, you can make your own creations in lua script and import them into the game with ease. all i have to say is just buy it already.",116.5

"what can i say about garrys mod? umm.. nothing. the game is a mixture of epic, weird and funny! garrys mod sandbox is not a pretty girl to look at on its own, but the servers.. oh the servers. coming from gamemodes such as trouble in terrorist town, zmod, murder and every gmod tower gamemode... i just can not come without recommending this game. but if the workshop conetent and the ability to mod this game was to be cut from it, this would not be appealing at all. what drew people to this game is its simple and yet genious lua code. it can be modified but you cant live without seeing some pointers first! even i was a server host during time.. long long ago, and even tho i was new to the thing, lua drew me deeper and deeper in! so overall, garrys mod is a 10/10",471.1

"you build stuff out of static props of various shapes, boring. you spawn npcs that cant act on their own, boring. all the custom gamemodes you can play online are inferior versions of other games. i feel more meaningful creativity from customizable character/class builds in action games since what im doing has an actual effect. sitting back and seeing some useless creation i wasted hours to build seems horrible to me.",62.5

"when i first saw garrys mod and tested it a little, i was critical of it. but when i took it upon myself to buy the thing, i was in love. you could spend hours upon hours of sandbox alone, making a group of police fight a horde of zombies for your enjoyment. but then you get to multiplayer. prop hunt, murder, trouble in terrorist town, etc. this game is by far best with friends, but theres no shame in playing alone. still a butt load of fun to be found. 10/10.",16.5

"the game itself is great and addicting 10/10 but the main-reason, why i wont recommend gmod anymore, is, that youll find more than 90% kiddies and idiots on the public available gameservers, which just kills all the fun. for example, when you want to play a speciefic gamemode, like ttt, you would first google it. most of them just created an account (id 85 xxx xxx and higher), and join random servers, kill everyone and yell sorry i dont know how to play if most of the players, who play it, would behave like they should for the age needed to be allowed to buy it, i would recommend gmod again",1023.0
