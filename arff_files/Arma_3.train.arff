"yes totally reccomending this game the campaign may suck but the online! love the vitual reality with customizable charcters with 1000s of combinations and a great selection of guns! what i didnt like: de-sync in online (de-sync is where a character glitches or objects in game causes lag usually items disappear or you will die) great mechanics. if you really want a simulator (military) this is the best youll find nothing better then what you see here. pros virtual arsenal training grounds great mechanics cons de-sync minor lag by far one of the best fps games ever cod is stupid now you will never go back",31.8
"a game where walls are just for show and you can walk right through em,a game where ifrits are unbreakable no matter the height, a game where you can fuken get thrown out of a c130 and ram into the ground and live great game",168.1
"good game, very good realistic military simulator game. 10/10 would arma again.",140.1
"the game mwas fun to p[lay it runs perfict on ultra or low grapichs and i think everyone should get it when you have a chance",2.9
"okay, this is the thing here, the game is actually good. the graphics are the , the game is nice and fun, but there is just one thing, so tremendously horrible that it ruins the whole entire game, and thats how it runs. it is not well polished, and if you have an amd processor you can just throw it out of the window. my computer is a very good computer. it has no problems with lagging, fps, and crashes. this is the first game that i had a very low fps on. now they did promise to somehow patch this huge issue, but the thing about that promise, is we might as well cut off the developers pinkie finger now if you catch my drift. that promise was made a long time ago! an extremely long time ago! not only that, but if your looking for action, this is most definitely not the game for you. play something from battlefield, that will give you some aldrenaline rushes. take your 60 dollars, and buy titanfall. i played that game and you can really get into it! but, when you look at it like a simulator, it is a bit fun. i would give this game a 6 out of 10, but since its 60 ing dollars, i have to put this down to 4/10. if the game were to patch it, and fix the lag, i would give it an 8/10 and recommend it, if they lowered the price to atleast $45, i would recommend it and give it a higher rate.",53.2
"sandbox? yes feels amazing? yes get in an unit,or play gamemodes and you will enjoy this game a lot. just buy it already",648.2
"true military simulator. it includes nearly everything that would be in an amazing military sim. there are so many things that i cant list them all, but ill do my best: pros -open world -realistic fatigue & gun movement (can be a con) -coriolis effect -realistic flight -realistic driving -realistic damage -realistic exposions & radious - if someone dies in your squad it can impact the game greatly -unlike many other military games, if something goes wrong in arma, you have to improvise, and you usually have to improvise fast, instead of going back to a checkpoint -no checkpoints -moddable -world/map editor to make your own levels or to just expirement and have fun cons -figuring everything out can be a hassle, and ive played over 70 hours and still havent figure out everything -the world can look untexturized and people are sometimes halfway in the ground when looking through a sniper rifle scope -can be a bit clunky at times while working in the world editor so overall, arma 3 is amazing and you should stop reading this review & buy it immediaty like, right now immediatly",73.4
"well let our modders add content - this game is the most realistic mod making simulator to date.",221.6
"im haten on spacewaffle right now cause he got arma 3 and im siting just eating my own cho cho train here and im like bruh shout out to ya boi.",2.0
"i bought the game and a few weeks with out playing becuase my pc broke it wants me to buy it agian and all my games that i bought are like this but it was a good game",1.7
"get it. the modding capablilities and gamemodes are the best in the business.",240.8
"love this game.. enjoyed many hours so far hopeful many more in the future",89.5
"recommend it because its a good game, very good fps game, big variety of mods, some bugs (bohemia interactive likes to create games with more bugs than normal, dayz is an example) but overall worth the money.",4.7
"really nice game.. beautiful aswell. just the campaign made me rage xd",233.6
"arma 3 is a great advancement from arma 2, it still holds the fun aspects of gameplay but comes with bigger, better more modern equipment and rifles. also it comes with a wide range of aircraft including remote control drones, i would recommend this game to anyone wanting to have fun for a good price as there is many different types of severs.",283.7
"i would recommend this game to the people that enjoy the arma series and as so if you enjoy a real experience and simulation to a real war and battle then you should buy this game.",19.4
"i would recommend it to someone who is new to the series...however..if you are a hardcore arma ii player like myself then do not buy this...unless you want to play altis life or some other crap.. this game was one of the biggest let downs",6.8
"very realistic and has verstaile module options. a very realistic military fps/3rd person simulation game.",285.6
"with the new zeus dlc, i honestly think that the future of rts is with this game. if you have the hardware to run the game its a must-buy, its the only pc game out there thats actually a full military simulator rather than run and gun fps.",9.5
"i got in an altis life server and was arrested for stealing a police truck",5.6
"its a great improvement compared to its predecessor arma ii. i mean, you used to die when opening a door while standing in front of it in arma ii ... new graphics and physics are looking really good. i actually get more fps with higher settings than in arma ii gameplay is alot smoother and saver now 9/10",20.6
"the thinking mans shooter. also hilarious physics glitches and one of the most active and diverse modding communities out there. if you like shooting things, but dont have the reflexes for cs anymore, get this. its amazing!",201.0
"in the beginning the controls were so frustrating that i quited several times until i was determined to continue and learn the game i payed for with my hard earned bucks. once i knew everything, i had an absolute blast. from flying choppers, to taking a 20 minute trip to the main ao. the map is extremely huge! i like everything about the game except for the standard bugs (what a f shame) and the dlc. not enough content. looks like a rip off. anyway, i highly recommend this game for anyone who likes dedicated communities and team work. be determined to learn and i guarantee you that you will have a blast. you will enjoy the game and its community.",166.7
"another great adition to the arma collection! arma 3 is closer to the most perfect action simulation i have tryed lots of new additions are included in this one. a nice touch with scuba diving and mine disarming, ai are realy on the ball, too die is very easy too :-( nice touch of wiled things around the map including the odd snake or too. bound to bite if close enough so stay clear. anouther darn head ach to tend too he he. just a thought.. ..maybe some hard core bomb disposal & disarming in the next mod or too please? 10/10 for this arma 3 thanks!",40.0
"best game ever. you can play wasteland or battle royal. if you prefer more relaxing gameplay then try altis life role play.",404.1
"an infinite playground. feel like some competition play? boot up multiplayer and hop on wasteland or tdm matches. scenario play? join one of the massive missions kicking around online. extremely cool and unique singleplayer experiences? hop on steam workshop and get one of the top rated missions. want to goof around with your friends? fire up a co-op mission. theres no game that offers you this much flexibility and this much room to stretch out in. if youre an arma vet, you know this already. unlike the previous arma games though, despite some bugs, its not completely inaccessible to the public. the server system is incredibly easy to use. steam integration is fantastic. the player models and controls dont feel like operating heavy machinery (except when youre operating heavy machinery). infantry controls are fluid. helicopters take time to master but are a joy once you do. tanks and armored vehicles are appropriately weighty (if a little low on torque and climbing power at times... i often wish i had manual gearboxes). play arma iii. youll have a lot of fun.",990.8
"i recommend this game to all modern day shooters and arma lovers.",6.3
"pretty dissapointed. to me, it doesnt live up to arma or arma 2. the campaign so far hasnt done anything for me, very repetitive, not much variety & i dont understand why theres been a month between each part of it. id rather much go back to a/a2 campaigns and replay them. i feel theyve been lazy in the lack of content for the single player side of things, not introducing any single player missions themselves like in arma or a2 & relying purely on the community for that aspect. for me, as much as i like playing online (through 2 very barren wastelands) i do like a good campaign to work through first and single player missions. id much rather play through the operation flashpoint franchise (bar red river & dragon rising because they were terrible.) as in my point of view for a war simulator they are still very much un-beatable",25.3
"military simulator which achieves so much, whether it be the single player modes or one of the extensive multiplayer modes, this game will keep you hooked.",133.0
"this game is awesome! people actually play online, a personal favourite gamemode of mine is capture the island. this is pretty much domonation on a bigger scale. if anyone gets this game-please let me know so we can play it at some point. also, the graphics are incredible, especially when on ultra!",252.6
"arma 3 is an improvement over the previous ones. for an arma fan like myself, though, it is the best arma so far.",21.6
"arma 3 so far is basically arma 2 except buggier, prettier, worse, ran better, and with less mods. its... a confusing cocktail of less 2 steps back 1 step forward, and more 2 steps to the left, 4 forward, and then a crip walk in a circle. it has all of the makings of an excellent game i just hope that the success of dayz has left them with enough staff to worry about fixing this game up like they did with arma 2.",12.1
"my team died. i was all alone. i had managed to kill many of the enemy. when the path to the objective seemed safe and clear, i made a run for it. *boom* a grenade launcher shot blew up right next to me. i fell out of my chair in fear and had to take off my headset to make sure i was still alive. 10/10 would cry again",61.4
"if arma 4 does not come out, i will slit your mother.",136.3
"pretty awesome! loads of mods and sweet singleplayer plus battle royale or dayz, this game is easily worth the 60 you pay. with the immersive gameplay and treating it like real life you will feel and act like it is war and thats what sold me on this unique game. now if they could have put it on sale before i bought it that would have been nice!",10.7
"this game is amazing, lots of great new features and genrally a good game overall",486.4
"i think this might be the most realistic war game i have ever played :)",349.4
"seemed pretty fun, but i think it would be much better if it was actually optimised and able to get more than 25 frames. its way to arcadey, and took arma 2s barebone flight mechanics and somehow made it worse. barely anyone online (probably playing their $30 mod) too. playing this game makes me want to be a ing terrorist, so i could do the world a favor and kill the team at bi who made this. 9.999999999/10 its alright",8.4
"great game, some good missions on the steam workshop to keep this playing.",107.4
"this game should be for the mac osx operating system!",91.8
"a lllllllot better than arma and arma 2 the game play and performance has improved, but still kind of a rage game especially when ai on normal can headshot you from 500 meters away with an assult rifle with red dot sights(ultra realism huh?) also you still die in like 3 shots",30.6
"this game is awesome, i got it back in 2014 right after the free weekend was over, i recommend this game to everyone!",182.4
"i will buy this the next time theres a sale where the games under 20. i sampled it for the free trial and it was very good.",6.9
"for me personally arma 3 is the game i love to play te most, weather im attacking a squad and battling in wasteland or fighting for kavala in king of the hill or my personal favorite role playing in altis life theres a community for everyone and this makes arma 3 the game it is. its more than just a war simulator its been made into a game where you can play with friends and still have a relexed fun and enjoyable experience for everyone and for the hardcore shooters out there there is still the intnsity of battle for you guys too! to conclude id strongly reccomend this game and it is seriously worth checking out!",920.5
"i absolutely love this game. there is so much to do and explore, the sky is the limit! i wish my computer ran the game enough, but i definately got my use out of it. it is very easy to set up scenarios with friends, such as rading a town or completeing a close air support mission. all in all, an absolutely amazing game.",191.0
"if you like beating people to death with dragon  then this is your game",641.9
"its a great game. to bad i cant afford to put even 5 dollars towards it.",501.1
"arma 3 + 0 mods = good game arma 3 + steam workshop mods = better arma 3 + armaholic mods = the best 12/10, must buy. best game ever buyyyyy it",282.0
"awesome sim. many servers are still under development but it feels very real to play the game.",23.2
"desync is real, get swallowed by metal fences and brick walls and rocks resulting in death .......",912.9
"extremely good game great single player better multiplayer and tons of mods/addons/maps/custom missions and alot more. must buy.",59.6
"its nice game becuse the graphics is fantastic! and the game for free !!!!..",0.5
"this is gonna be est game ever i see you dont make dayz mode for arma 3 but its not gonna happen u create new game for day z u published videos for u are working on arma 3 for dayz you guys said you are going to publish it soon u tricked people",343.5
"its a playground if you put your mind to it. lasing targets, flying jets, piloting a sumbmarine, or just firing tracers into a dark stormy night is only a grain of sand in a desert. jump in feet first and enjoy!",400.7
"why buy h1z1 when you can play battle royale on this puppy without having to pay $7/month later?",5.1
"if you play cod dont buy it , u may suicide :d , 10/10 must own!",17.0
"i recommend playing dayz first, as the community taught me all the tips and tricks about playing arma or an arma based mod. when i first picked up arma 3, even after staring at the config screen, i was still confused and got stuck repeatedly. with dayz it kinda progresses you from how to change from first person to third, shooting, then figuring out how far your target is away so you can compensate for it. arma doesnt really teach you that right away, thats way i was lost. also, the campaign in arma (what ive played of it) is pretty cool, aswell as the multiplayer, but its big hitter is definetly the mods. battle royal, atlas life, theyre all great and super fun, as well as the community. i definetly recommend you get this game as there are endless posibilities.",21.2
"like the boss once told me: what about you, jack? whats it going to be? loyalty to your country, or loyalty to me? your country, or your old mentor? the mission, or your beliefs? your duty to your unit, or your personal feelings? you dont know the truth yet. but sooner or later youll have to choose. in choosing my country over my old mentor, and having to kill her... i choose to not fight for any flags, i choose not to kill for the sake freedom. there is no freedom, in this day and age, there is no peace; freedom and peace are all lies conjured up by the warlocks of the goverment, the heads of states... war... war has changed and so has our methods. join us, join the diamond dogs. let us beride of these liars, these cheap salesmen, let us change the world; one goverment at a time. let opperation altis & stratis begin.",45.3
"i completely stand behind this game. this is a military simulator so right off the bat you know that this is not the typical call of duty, or newest battlefield game. it takes strategy and teamwork to complete the missions when playing co-op. when speaking of multiplayer, you have so many options. i have not even gotten to the story yet because i have played so much multiplayer. you can choose to play some of the core missions that are included with the game, but you can also play mods that other people create, this is where i feel that the game excells. i have played many of the most popular mods to date on this game such as arma life, altis life, breaking point, epoch, and many more. i can confidently say that even if you do not like the core missions of the game you can sink countless hours into most of the multiplayer mods/servers that this game has. now for the only downfall i have come across when playing the game, you cannot play this on a low end pc, this game is very un-optimised and you need some powerful hardware to run the game smoothly. i have a gtx 970, and a i7-4790k and i still experience some bad framerates on certain servers and mods, so be warned you wont get 1000 fps, but that aside it is a amazing game. solid 10/10.",136.7
"great game, great mods. i still feel like it needs work, but its still tons of fun!",43.5
"very fun game for people who like military simulator style games. got some bugs, but still worth it.",225.7
"online multiplayer: me: under fire friend: where from!? me:i dont know....ummm (checking compass bearing)....oh doesnt matter im dead friend: oh ok awesome game with huge diversity, play as a team for best experience, only probelm with this game is that the online servers can sometimes have really terrible fps with your pc, even if you have a good rig.",146.1
"great game, different server have different mission and you can play ho ever you want be it the lone wolf to hit squad",133.6
"a better looking version of arma 2 with little about that game fixed. steep learning curve. better tutorial this time. ai has aim hacks. you will watch as your team cant hit the broad side of a barn while the enemy ai can nail you with one bullet from 1500 yards. too frustrating to really continue with campaign.",3.3
"this game is amazing. i know that it is by no means finished, but at least bis has been giving us updates on its progress fairly often. if you get the right mods right now, such as voice activated commands and tmr, this game can be insanely fun today! hopefully bis will get around to getting some of these great mods implemented into the vanilla arma 3, but until then the modding community has us covered. i would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in some tactical, realistic, teamwork oriented, and some crazy fun gameplay.",373.3
"this game is for real bros who like to play a realistic, no kiddie, true to life battle simulator. this game can be anything you want it to be. i was playing with a clan but it was too involved. if you are sick of battlefield 3.1 or cod50,000 then play this game. this game is going to get better and better as time goes along. just think about it; arma2:oa came out in 2010 and people were still modding and improving it summer 2013. farcry 3 is allegedly skyrim with guns but this game truly is. look for weather fx, 25 km squared maps; everything. definitely a must buy.",88.5
"awesome game, major improvements, especially the voice acting because in arma 2, it was horrible to listen to. although there is plenty of random crashes, this is afterall alpha so it has time to be improved, but just from the alpha ive had a great time.",466.6
"great game, very fun gameplay, however i only played it free for the weekend. if i had the money, i would have bought it.",33.2
"it took forever to download and was a complete waste of seven hours of my life",0.9
"worst fps ever... battle field is far better than this trash...",2.2
"very fun game that is worth every pennny. make sure you have a good rig! it will help immensly!",146.6
"ing hate this game. makes my internet constantly drop out and the mods/server browser is extremely glitchy.  you bohmeia",20.1
"best game in my mind. started playing arma 2 back when it came out and the amount of mods you can get for both is amazing but this game takes it a bit further. i can spend hours playing dress up and making meth in my underwear, nothing else compares. and if you want to play with milsim groups there are plenty out there. you can go diving with the female mod so you can have your babe with you, go sky diving then watch the sunset together. 11/10 will try to hit on that chick again.",740.5
"sometimes when i fly in a chopper, i like to look into the eyes of my copilot while i purposely fly into a mountain.",20.4
"really great game! much realistic, very deaths. but seriously! this game is the most realistic fps! it only takes a few shot to die. you definitely are not arnold schwarzneger (terminator), sylvester (rambo) or daniel craig (james bond). it has very hard singleplayer missions. maybe its because i usually act like terminator and try to run in everyones face with my assault rifle... dunno.. feels realistic.",22.6
"this game is just so mutch u can do in :d its epic for my, base building, rp, fps, it got everything",391.3
"very cool game, love the campaign and the mods avaialble are limitless.",7.3
"pls update for more fps :c my pc is good i play 30 fps ( medium) but more is better :c",25.2
"i hit a tree with a tank then it became a flying projectile 11/10 best tank simulation",105.5
"awesome game! i dont play arma though, i play the mod breaking point! its great!",30.9
"as good as it get for tactical simulation. hours of gameplay, so much fun!",56.0
"an awesome game to enjoy with friends. makes you feel like youre in the actual battle.",92.7
"ran over a hill. got shot by a tank. got called a noob. 10/10 would noob again",0.5
"first off, let me say that arma 3 is a pretty amazing game with a great community... if you can run it smoothly. i run a pretty nice rig with a gtx 770 (wayyyy above the recommended) and get around 40-55 fps on ultra in singleplayer, but somehow run 20-25 max fps in multiplayer. this fps occurs on all the settings in multiplayer, including low. if bohemia fixed the fps problem id gladly tell them shut up and take my money please help us help you!",4.1
"well , i bought this game on the first alpha days , when it was 32.99$. i really like strategy (hope i wrote it right) and simulator games & fps games. this game contains many objects and many ways to play , the vanilla has no many weapons nor cars and aircrafts , but , there is a big but , you can use the workshop on steam to use maps  missions  other mods to make your playing much more funny and realistic. if you consider spend around 40 - 50$ when its on sale , do that , on this game of course.",123.6
"this game is full of bugs. the ai is either thicker than door posts and couldnt hit the side of a barn with a shotgun, or supersnipers with laser xray vision. glitches abound, gameplay is like wading through liquid latex. optimization will leave you thinking microsoft, intel, amd, and bohemia interactive are all conspiring to make you buy the latest liquid cooled 10 000thz cpu, nvidia/radeon gtx 9999 in crossli with ram up the ying yang. buy it. seriously. it will disappoint so badly, but give you so much satisfaction, that you will overlook all of the above and become addicted. i know i did. and then....karts. seriously?! from a dev who listens to its supporters a milsim dev. that creates absolutely peurile sidesteps. instead of working on fixing stuff that is actually wrong? karts?!! w.t.f? i am so disappointed i want my dragon rising to cry me a red river. codemasters...dirt....i see you on the horizon.",447.5
"played it for some time when it was free best game eva if ya have the muneyz buy this! :) it has allot of mods to so :*",17.3
"pros: -realistic -intense -fun -never gets boring, can make countless scenerios cons: very graphics demanding",51.0
"looking pretty amazing; absolutely can not wait for the final product. this game is going to be intense.",946.5
"this game is fun to play with friends on a server or download the communitys games and try them out. loads of different modes online you can play. but i recommend playing with friends its way more fun to screw around that way",72.5
"this is not your typical fps, if you played the earlier rainbow six titles, swat series, operation flashpoint or other simulation based tactical shooters, this is the game for you.",401.1
"tried to do a backflip in a helicopter, didnt press z whilst upside down... i died. 99/11",20.7
"after playing in a few ops with my team. i can, honestly, say that arma 3 was worth the $59.99. it is so realitic that it adds so much immersion that it makes you feel like you are there fighting the good fight. 10/10 will buy arma 4 if they make one.",11.8
"buggy as hell. they never fixed weird issues like being able to walk through walls. hard to tell when youve actually shot someone. no real visual indicator that youve shot someone, so you end up shooting them 5 times out of confusion. single player campaign seems badly thought out. i basically had to save scum to get off of the first island. ai is awful. no armory mode or quick mission mode. i regret buying this in alpha.",27.3
"if you ever wanted an army game simulator, you should look after arma series. caution: cod players wont survive !",324.2
"just wow! there is so muuuch to discover in this game! unlimited potential to rpg gaming! i really enjoy altis life ! hope there will be much more added, so i dont need to go outside anymore and can do all my stuff inside my second life in altis.",108.2
"a definite upgrade from arma ii, the controls act more like pc controls of the 21st century (not feeling like your wading through pudding when trying to look, strafe, etc.) and the graphics of course are much improved. there have been some issues with physx crashes, but only from those with amd cards in my experience. sa-matra wasteland alone is reason enough to pick this up! the only gripe i really have is that they still have not made the client/server multi-threaded. one of the most idiotic things to overlook when the ai calculations and such really make this game/engine heavily cpu-intensive. if you love realistic shooters without all the kill-streak b.s. and handicapping, pick this game up.",547.3
"great game! nice graphics and much better fps than arma2.",89.2
"just buy arma 2, its performs better and doesnt have the bulk of its content locked behind dlc. also it doesnt crash nearly as much.",5.6
"do you enjoy constant ctd? get this. its all it does. get a good desktop wallpaper, because youre going to be seeing it alot.",831.0
"pretty fun i run around for 17 hours, and then i found someone and they were elite solider irl and pwned me. good game.",89.9
"really great game, or simulator i should say despite the many bugs this game has (which eventually will be worked out), its really fun(if you have a high quality pc if you have a low-end pc you might want to think about upgrading before you purchase it, its a real cpu eater.). one dislike i have is the over-rated, over-played game modes wasteland and altis life but it really isint the game more like the community itself, its sometimes hard to find a good realism game mode with a decent amount of players or decent ping, and more guns could be added too (which are) its quite annoying to have to download a mod for a specific firearm. overall its a great buy, well worth the money",73.2
"arma 3 offen used as a combat sim for clans can be boring and demanding but the game itself is great the game looks and feals like an open world combat game, with that being said the community behind it are very much the weakist link in the game modders clans and servers all think they own the game they like to play i am higher ranked then you! moders dont code in the best way they can and then lie about what the games engine can and cant do, there are fine pepole out there playing this game but mp is as with every other game full of pepole you would like to punch in real life. is it worth the money? for single player alone this game is worth it and mp/mods are the 2th best thing in the game if you liked arma 2 you will also like arma 3. arma 3 is only an upgrade to the already great arma 2 new maps and content leave this game fealing freash and new. the one thing i hate the most about the game is the fact that it is based on prototype tanks planes atc they are not real! and this leaves the game fealing like a peace of the future not what i like imo",183.7
"the game is really awesome, love the near future feel of all the vehicles and the ability to fully customize your weapons. the only things that bother me is that the amout of weapons and vehicles (really the fixed wings, but heard there are more coming) are nowhere near the amout thats in arma ii. also my hardware isnt being used for 100%, only get 30 fps max on low and ultra preset and at both settings my hardware is only being used for 50-60%. if they add more vehicles and optimize the game further then im in again! i still recommand the game, its a lot of fun!",80.8
"love this game. love it how it is set and everything!",78.1
"children play call of duty, boys play battlefield, men play arma.",329.6
"got called a  and got shoot down from the cop 10/10 real life.",346.7
"nothing beats popping a tire on a road sign and having to walk 10km to the nearest repair kit 10/10 i only really play this when i have a whole afternoon of nothing to do",323.0
"fly a chopper land on tower get blown up die 10/10 game would buy again :steven mcdowall",829.6
"its arma. if youve played arma 2 you know what your getting.",49.8
"amazing game, does need good computer to run, but, that not a prob for me ;d minor bugs, very funny when playing with different stances. campaign is well written and well created, i give this game 8 tacos out of 10 babes.",635.5
"so complicated cant understand but is fun if you want this game i would recommend insurgency because it is simpler unless you love arma series",0.7
"what more to say? coming back to this from a few years away and its great to see how its developed. being a fan from arma, arma 2 and even vbs 2, you cant go wrong with checking this out. but there are conditions: you have to love the milsim side of life, you can do anything. you have to persevere also. you will die. again and again... this game will suck you in. big time....",219.1
"buggy and not even worth the discounted price. i wish i could get a refund.",1.0
"good game more of a simulator though overall worth buying for 20",148.2

"must have... it has many mods and unlimited potential. dayz standalone is a mod from this engine. tries to be most realistic looking army based game. supposedly used in different forms to train troops is something ive heard in the past. head swivel look is something more games should have... also leaning and prone, crouch, standing fire... ect.... buy it for $30-$35 usd.",61.6
"one of the most realistic games i have ever played. this is very challenging, but a little hard to learn. there are tutorials, and i would greatly recommend playing through them all. the helicopter expansion is just the , the helicopter is a beast in this game, and i had a lot of fun learning how to fly it. i have yet to learn how to actually get one in gameplay, but again, i imagine this game takes a really long time to get used to. the controls are a little wonky sometimes though. i am not sure if it is because i havent learned all of them yet, but i find myself in menu that i dont know how to get out of, or not being able to quickly take aim and fire. the game does support my xbox360 controller though, however, by using it i lose some functionality. some vehicles/equipment require more manipulation than my controller has buttons. i dont have any doubts that i will eventually figure it out, but if you have friends that are already in the game, i would recommend teaming up with them to learn about it. great game if you are a fan of realistic and difficult combat.",15.7
"bad game. horrible game engine. system requirements for what? nope company. few models. multiplayer always glitches. waste of money.",31.5
"crazy good game. im temted to buy it but its a bit too expencive in my opinion (and does not fit in my buget). i was however able to get hold of it for an hour (free download event) and it was good fun and enjoyd every second of that hour.",0.8

"spend 3 days hiding in a bush, get shot by someone you cant see. 10/10",420.1
"an old soldier, in a new outfit. a lot has changed in the game, the first improvement i would mention is the ai. npcs became more responsive of their surroundings and situations, making them a challenging foe or a good friend. i find it harder to eliminate enemies as they give supportive fire to each other and moving up to you, never leaving you space to attack. the commanding system is just as how i thought it is going to be. not much have improved, if i send a group into a building to set up a defensive posture, they still have no idea what to do and start to move around the building. yet again, i have to place them in the building one-by-one which is time consuming and especially bad in a combat situation. i like the new movement system and bullet ballistics. i have a more reliable control over my character, yet i find it difficult to hit a target and the enemy gets the same thing. now i wont get shot in the head from 100m with a pistol. ais are actually missing their shots, when shooting at me. the graphics are amazing, even in standard quality and i still get my average 50 fps. hell yeah! :d so far im liking this game, i just find it difficult to get used to the new movement and weapon system, but as it was with arma 2... ill get used to it slowly. :)",51.8

"what has made this series so popular is the ability to mod it. the game by itself (talking about arma 2 and arma oa) are terrible games, but i have 100s of hours playing the modded versions of them, particularly the ace mod. since ace is not out for arma 3, and no sign of when it may come out, i cannot in good conscious recommend this game to anyone. the arsenal available in vanilla arma 3 is miniscule, and they have recycled a lot of graphical stuff from arma 2, making this worthy of the $20 shelf, not the current $60 price point. in summary, with ace out i would pay $60 for arma 3 today. without ace, only 2 maps, 2/3 of a campaign out, and no real game improvements coming from bohemian i would wait until this game gets to $19.99. update 22 july 2014. i can finally recommend this game again, since there are enough mods out there to once again make this game great. bi makes a poor game, the modding community makes it into a great game. while ace is still not out, there are other mods coming forward such as agm that make this game great. the weapon sway is completely broken without mods. as of this writing it is still $60, which is more than i would pay. pick this up on a steam sale for $30 or less.",323.0

"i had a go at this game at a friends after he introduced it to me and then yesterday in the free weekend. it is an easy game to get to grips with the basic movements but takes time to learn and master some of the extra functions you have. grpaphics and game play are superb and smooth. i never notice any lag. the open style field of operations is huge. there are many weapons and vehicles to use. it is more akin to battlefield than cod. you are in squads with soldiers of different skills. you have pilots, medics, marksmen, engineers and infantry. you need a pilot to fly the choppers - you cant all do everything. so it is a true co-op. what i prefered with this game over battlefield is the co-op elelment of the game is humans against ai. this meant i did not take 15 mins to arrive at a battle with my level 1 peashooter only to be oblitorated by a soldier with a personal nuclear warhead! i believe there are humans v human servers too but i never tried these. this gives the novice time to experiment with the game and equipment. there is also an effective boot camp to train you before combat. i have only scratched the surface of what there is to learn. i will buy the game based on the co-op missions alone. you need time to play the game. it is not a 30 min game to play before bed!",217.8

"amazingly fun, amazingly hard. this is for real, folks. forget about running and gunning. forget about killing soldiers who see you first. youre dead. annoying? yes. but so much fun, still! i love the feel to the game. the graphics are amazing, and its incredibly immersive. especially coupled with a good head tracking system like the trackir!",70.0
"this game is awesome !!! gameplay is so good. play tactical !!",529.0
"this game is amazing. straight up no ifs ands or buts about it. it does fall short in some areas compared to previous titles, for example the vehicle selection is tiny compared to arma2 but this will likely change over the course of the games life as bi is releasing new content in sections like the campaign. then of course there are the myriad of mods to tide you over :). if youre at all into milsim or hardcore fps games youre probably going to love this. the games biggest strength is simply that you can do almost anything you want to in it. you want to drive into the target area with a sub, swim to shore and rise out of the water like a navy s.e.a.l? you can do that. want to fly in in an ah-6 loaded for bear? you can do that, want to fly a jet? drive a tank? skydive? attack at night? use a mortar? be a sniper? fly an attack heli? or just go in as a footsoldier? arma 3s got you covered. its as it is advertised...the ultimate military sandbox. probably going to be my favourite or one of my favourite games of 2013 and 2014 especially in terms of longevity.",196.6
"i do recommend this game from all the gameplay ive seen (i dont currently own the game) however, it is the only game i know that strategically promotes military warfare very very accuraretly. i love the stimulation of the game and i love every single thing about it even the bugs. if i had the opportunity to play it i would 100% give my full review about the game and my experiences. i can not afford it at the time however, even after i would fully support the game.",38.6
"amazing. now with more fps the game is running smoothly and is actually playable now. in the past.. you need a hell of a computer. i recommend it now.",748.6
"best fps game ive played in awhile. fan of the realism and roleplay including the moded servers which make it way better. playing with a group or alone you will enjoy this game. give this game a 9/10 ; optimization is very good , downfall is the high pinged servers.",100.0

"i remember getting arma 2 on special back in the day, played it once then put it on the shelf. then i seen this mod called dayz and i have been sucked into the arma world ever since. more to the point, arma 3. a vast improvement on its predecessor but still a game that takes a lot of trial and error before you really get the hang of it and can appreciate the engine. the single player campaign was slowly worked on and released over time, with fixes and improvements over a period of time to end up with a really nice and although linear storyline, they really add elements that allow you to verge away from the main storyline and engage in heaps of other tasks and activities ( i had to play the main campaign twice to appreciate it) the main reason to get arma 3 though is the mods. from breaking point, epoch to a heap of mission maps and game modes, arma really throws a lot of diversity at you and is great bang for your buck.",593.4

"i absolutly love this game though i have a bad pc and this game is very demanding (my pc runs at 10-30 fps with low settings) it is still very fun",143.8
"really fun game. but apparently when you dont play the game for about 3 months it bans you. stopped playing it just to randomly come back on one day and was banned for some reason unknown to me. i dont know how to cheat in any video game let alone a game as confusing to deal with downloads and gamemodes than arma.. anyone know what i can do?",16.9
"so far, the downside will be the fatigue system. the upside is great gameplay, decent online community, immersive story, and should the game seem thin or lacking, mod support! mods that can be activated in the arma 3 launcher, which means you can activate which mods you want and leave a few idle. i highly recommend this game, it is a must have for military gamers!",469.4
"seriously a great game. amazing for modding. its definitely worth the $60.",74.2
"its a must buy. love the graphics. love all the mods. i enjoy modding in this game, best game i like thats mod friendly. you must buy this game, you are missing out on all those cool multiplayer gamemodes like arma 3 life, wasteland, altis life, king of the hill, breaking point and epoch mod. buy now!",258.8

"this combines the fps that every serious fps military gamer would want to play, it has great customization for your apparel, the guns are also easily customizable and it looks great on ultra high, even better is the fact that it has a very active gaming community and workshop items are constantly being added. also, when you kill people you can rob their pants. 11/10",0.3

"this is a review coming from a hardcore cod player. dont get me wrong i love playing cod but its the same thing every match with the same game types. i wanted something i could play it smart and be very tacticle. no running and gunning. if you are looking for a game where multiplayer matches would be short and crazy, this is not it. multiplayer is a whole other monster in arma. single player is fun, the campaign is cool and dlc is awesome. playing missions online is soo fun and communication is pretty much required. special gamemodes online add a garrys mod element to it allowing for something different. though i havent had much time to play it it hasnt felt like i have even scratched the surface. its a different shotter, you really are the soldier.",57.1
"features one of the worst aiming systems ever made in a video game (if you manage to kill someone it will be by sheer luck). combine that with piss poor ai, an unnecessarily complicated inventory system, random deaths to invisible landmines and voice acting which is at the level of x-rebirth and you get arma 3. one of the single most unfun experiences of my life and ive seen razorlight live.",2.9

"arma 3 continues on the merits of the original operation flashpoint and while many additions imply much welcomed improvements throughout, the core of the issues remain unresolved, leaving complexity rather than depth. it is the best version of the sandbox/editor/experiment, but as a game, it is still the flawed mess that the original flashpoint introduced back in the days. atleast flashpoint had the excuse of originality being it was the first of its kind when released, which leaves arma 3 to nothing more than minor improvements in an environment that requires massive enhancements. buy if the previous titles meant something to you to the extent of wanting to experience them in a slightly newer engine. avoid if you expected them to actually make a game of quality.",50.8
"holy, what can i say? bohemia you did it again, there is never a dull moment with this game, one moment i was walking through a forest with my men, being stealthy (i took my pants off to be super sneaky) and one guy set off a mine, killed 2 of my men, we had to fight a whole squad of the enemys my heart was racing. think you have had enough of this game? your wrong, there is tons of modders out there creating mods for our entertainment, from zombie killing to diving contests, there is a mod for you. dont feel like playing a mod? go to the steam workshop and find a mission that others made, for you to play!!! all in all 12/10",40.9

"ghostieproductions arma 3 review overview: a simply amazing game. including an editor, a manual covering the game, its engine, and also tips and tricks, you come prepared when purchasing this game. if you are a fan of singleplayer, then you can be sure to be happy when purchasing this game. it includes a 3-part campaign, along with showcases of each of the aspects of the game. the multiplayer is a massive amount of gamemodes, with small gangs of players trying to escape from overwhelming amounts of enemies, to massive amounts of players fighting each other, or cooperating to exterminate the other ai presence. pros: -great graphics, visually stunning, well drawn -audio feedback is pleasing to the ears -well designed weapons -realistic ballistic system -accurate vehicular controls -accurate damage system -overall fun to play -customizable hud cons: -not a very good story (you can make your own, though.) -hard to tell the health of your player, meaning that its hard to differentiate from you being just fatigued, and about to bleed out. mods can fix this issue. -selection system is flunky, using a mouse wheel is not ideal in combat situations. verdict: i am happy to give this great sandbox shooter a 9/10. the dlcs are not required to experience the hours of fun available from this game. enjoy.",276.5

(un?)fortunately theres another (none) game out there that can do the same; rocksmith 2014 and i cant put that one down either so at tqeh moment rs2014 is winning out, but i have no doubt i will return to arma 3 and loose a whole other chunk of my life!!!",92.0

"despite its flaws, the infantry combat is two steps up above arma 2, adding much needed fluidity to once an extremely clunky interface. that coupled with the inclusion of play withsix granting users an easy way to access the hundreds of user-generated content (a requirement), makes arma 3 worth getting at full price.",484.7

"not for me. i regretfully spent $60 on this game because i like the dayz mod. i know some people will say its a simulator, but at the same time its a game, and its not fun at all. you randomly spawn, always in a town by your lonesome. you trek lightyears ahead to find any action or objective thats randomly changing but the moment you step out of your vehicle you get sniped from an army of dudes in the mountains. rinse and repeat. im normally a multiplayer first, kind of guy but the campaign/bootcamp is entertaining. the game is also an insane rig to run without any framerate. i shouldnt need to watch youtube videos to learn how to make the game run decent.",5.2

"my initial review said that arma 3 would be a great game by late 2014 when more mods and content were released. i am glad to say that this became true several months before i expected. between the incredible zeus game mode (an on-the-fly mission creator) and excellent mods like advanced gameplay mod, task force radio and alive this is one of the best co-op games available. you will need at least 4-5 people to really have fun in multiplayer, but theres really no other game that offers what arma does.",231.6
"this game is really fun, and has so much mods you can play. i really reccommend this game. but there is one down part to it... its addicting!",27.1
"if you see me playing this, im probably having the time of my life, so dont bug me.",293.4
"its fairly rare for me to write recommendations in general, and its even rarer for me to find a game that ill keep coming back to after the 100 hour mark. arma 3 is definitely one of those games. im in no way saying its finished mind you. there are some occasional bugs, and sometimes the ai is really  or has laser rifles that pistol kill you from 1000m away (not so frequent anymore) but for what it offers, and what can be added via mods, this is one of my all time favorite games. if you have even one friend playing with you, youll have hours of fun. its really unbelievable how much you can do, and how much you keep coming back for even after frustrating encounters or missions. theres something for everybody in arma 3 (theres even a fishing mod for all you nonviolent pansies.) and it really provides a framework for you to do what you want with it. in all honesty, i am hard pressed to name a game that allows you the ease of introduction and ramps up to advanced techniques so smoothly. the more you play, the better you get (obviously) and ultimately, you decide how and what you want to play. the game goes on sale occasionally, so id wait til then, although i bought it full price and never looked back. its one of the very few unfinished games that i dont regret buying.",386.0
"not the game for me, it has very good graphical detail but that is about it. multiplayer is very laggy and borderline unplayable, controller support is listed as a feature however only a select few controls can be mapped to it - making playing with it extremely difficult. i bought into it when it was 20 in early alpha, i would not pay 40 for it now, and im glad i didnt.",8.9
"its buggy, unoptimized, has very little content out of the box, and is fun when playing with a group.",383.4
"awesome graphics and plot but games playability is very low. controls are very hard to use. you can not change them in the way you choose. it is the worst game i ever played for 4-5 years. really annoying just because of controls. there are universal keys like t for chat or y for team chat, they are totally different. and another problem is that bohemia uses the same strategy for their other products like dayz. another not recommended game for me.",3.0
"fun game but i only get a max fps of 50 and under when playing this online..... 3 stars",83.6
"i have always been a fan of the arma series because its really different than the other shooters. there are so many different ways to play this game, i spend hours scripting and fooling around in the editor for my own enjoyment. i dont play multiplayer that much but its still a great experience when i get to it. this game is very heavily gpu and cpu dependant so i wouldnt reccomend this to people who have a low-mid range gaming pc. mid ranges might still be able to run it but you will get lots of fps drops below 30 fps. this game is really fun and easy to get into. i am proud of the work that bohemia interactive is doing and continue to be a fan of their titles. i rate this game a 9.5/10.",203.2
"this game is extremly good. i recomend it to anyone that like roleplaying games.",597.6
"still some of the most bug infested games ive seen. texture and ground control is a joke, turn around to fast in a building and you might get killed. hide behind a rock? bad idea, as rocks have a tendancy to swollow you whole and spit you out somewere else to fall to your death. its a little strange really, seing that these things worked stably in games developed over two decades ago, like doom and wolfenstein 3d. is arma 3 still in early alpha?",531.7
"one of the better games i have played in a long time and the reason i will probably never play planetside 2 again. with massive and beautifully detailed maps, an impressive array of vehicles and just about any weapon and gadget you can think of its a war geeks dream. there is a stack of great community content available in the workshop too which gives the game unlimited playability and due to the sandbox nature of the game it can literally be anything! cannot recommend highly enough.",852.6
"this game is action-packed, but filled with humorous moments. great for anyone who likes simulations, fps, and strategy.",265.1
"whats better than opening a door and instantly dying? 10/10",228.6
"with the right mods and people, this is about as close as you want to get to actual combat [at least for the ground warfare] armas best feature is the dedicated modding community, you can find a mod for just about anything for arma. the game simulates fatigue, breathing and pain effect, as well as weapon weight, meaning that there wont be anybody out shooting a sub machine gun with a long rifle after being shot in the chest at near point blank range. there is a pretty good balistic simulation for vanilla arma but you can find mods for very realistic ballistics. i love pretty much everything about arma except these two things, of course, nothing is perfect. the game requires a pretty powerful computer setup to run effectively, even with my nvidia 770 graphics card, larger battles decrease frames quite a bit. and finally, armas controls can be rather clunky at times, the stance/lean controls specificly. it can be a problem at close range where a real human could move much faster. overall- 9.5/10 definetly worth the price if you can run it and enjoy teamwork and tactical combat.",135.0
"buyed arma because of my friends. never thought itll be so good. now i have 560h in not even a year. im addicted to it now :p i just started to work on my own map. the possibiltes of this game are insane. koth, epoch, altis life, battleroyal, coop, wasteland. in team we started to create our own little modes, the game is to insane. buy battlefield for 50$ or buy arma for 25$, i can just say arma is better :d",579.6
"great game, stunning graphics, and zombies....yes....zombies",42.2
"i have now played this game for over 30 hours and i do recommend it if you are fine with getting disconnected and losing all the items on you. if you dont mind that or find a server without battleye required it is a good game, all in all its worth buying",142.3

"so much more for your dollar compared to the big gaming system games. endless gaming options with tons of mini games inside the game popping up all the time. i highly recommend this game to almost everyone, seems to have something to offer for all types (not just first person shooters). gather your friends and dont expect to leave your computer for quite awhile. the only thing i would suggest is getting all the altis life servers updated with vehicles, jobs and weapons.",199.2
"complex but fun especially if you have friends to play with. - i didnt like it in the beginning i found it rigid and complex, mainly because i was comparing it to the other fps games in the market + very good gameplay + fancy graphics and physics are good + huge community contribution - you will walk a lot and you will be lost in the beginning i recommend it :)",174.3
"arma 3 in short! the good: - nice graphics - good sound (guns etc.- but some problems with 5.1 ss) - large map - lots of gear - mp - coop the bad: - the ai (it sucks aaaasssss, like no other i have ever seen - really, both your team mates and the enemy) - animations and the movements of soldiers are robotic* (with ai) - (mp) server lags with large no. of players",83.7

"the game is outstanding, the most realistic on foot, on air, and on sea combat simulation. the pace is intense, it rapidly changes through out each course of action you make.",242.5
"do not purchase this game if you are looking for something akin to cod or battlefield. however, if you want something slower-paced that actually makes you feel important without being an invincible juggernaut who slaughters his way through the forces of evil, then this game is likely a good choice. approach it tactically, learn your keybindings, play as a team, and this game is bar-none the most satisfying military shooter around. arma 2 is another competitor, but with the improvements to character movement, vehicle handling, and sheer non-gloomy atmospherics, i would have to say this iteration of the franchise ekes it out to be the one i would play first. but yeah, its a great way to meet people and a hell of a lot of fun with friends! but for the love of everything, if you dont know how to fly, dont try on a server where people can!",130.3

"to sum up arma 3. amazing workshop community, and creations. the singleplayer scenarios are great and well put together. on the other multiplayer can be a little spotty at times, fps could be much, much better. your fps is somewhat dependant on the server your playing on, which is kind of unfortunate. with that being said, it is an amazing game or milsim which ever one you like to call it. i would recommend it to anyone with a decent enough computer and a knack for hardcore military gameplay. -the only god",459.1

"hopped in a rhib and went to the airfield during the night, took a fuel truck from enemys then went and took a tank and blew up a new spawn in a sports car 10/10 this game is only really good if you have friends, and willing to download mods, and be able to put up with home made servers, and spawn kill in wasteland, and jets in wasteland etc",300.2
"while i cant say i played a lot of this game, i must say that i can tell it isnt my cup of tea. i wanted to see if my love for complex war simulators like the paradox game translated well into fpses but i find i prefer faster-pace and unrealistic fpses like counter-strike.",1.0

"the graphics and lighting on this game are amazingly well done. car headlights actually shine off things like real life, and the sunsets are beautiful. unfortunately, the physics are little more than ragdoll, and the vehicle handling feels like your wheels are actually ice skates and the road is an ice rink. the campaign is pretty boring - the storyline isnt anything special (but to be completely honest, i didnt play much more than 15 minutes since the first level is so damn dull). multiplayer is decent, with life rpg servers dominating the server list. altis life is fun for 4-5 hours, until you realise that theres 5 cars and 10 guns, and money takes the piss to earn because you always get arrested or shot by police/terrorists/annoying  civilians. if you try to join any other servers, especially the ones that have a mission which requires teamwork, you will be very disappointed. the majority of the arma 3 playerbase is now <13 years old (and none of them know how to play as a team - they all want the glory of a kill) thanks to the attention dayz drew to this series of games. overall though, i have to say its an ok game. i dont think the game is worth 35. i also think that the battleye anticheat is . other than that, you will probably enjoy it for a few days at least.",84.1

(idk if thats possible but it sounds cool) (ok it was just my key running over my keyboard) my helicopter was about to crash. i used an emergency exit. i flew out of the heli. landed infront of 4 guys. we became friends. then i shot at them. because i wanted their stuff. this was a bad idea. the shot back. then after 5 minutes of firefight. my friend joined. he came in a jet. he shot them down. i got their loot. me and my friend had a party. we shot guns. this was a bad idea. the 4 guys found us. they were not happy. they shot my friend. i shot their friend. (r.i.p steve) they threw a grenade at me. i died. i joined another server. i found a guy. i shot him. he survived. he killed me. i died. 11/10 friendly badguys. this took 10 minutes. i think. its christmas in 3 days. im happy. oh i just realised i wrote key instead of cat. oops. i hope ill get a new computer for christmas. i want to run this game on max settings. potato",15.2

"arma 3: arma the almighty miletary sim, which may catch your eye with the immersive feel and the futuristic feel which i will get to later. i feel that this is a good arma but not on the same par as arma 2 which can i tell you can be either a bag of piss or alot of fun to play with bugs and  ai to some of the most action packed immersive combat you will experience to date. arma 3 delivers what it sets out to do an invasion of a made up map and you need to help secure it (sorry if you would class that as a spoiler). there are few if any bugs and beautifull graphics great multiplayer improvement from arma 2 but as a fan of the series i am a bit dissapointed in bohemia with their choice of a futeristic feel which i dont personally like compared to modern combat. if you are a laid back gamer you will still enjoy this title due to the community, multiplayer, beauty, editor. the editor is my favourite part of the game as it lets you be creative and put what you would want in a campaign mission into your own. overall i would reccomend this game but if you are looking for an army sim go for arma 2 by far.",49.6

"arma 3 is a game like no other that i have ever played. the fact that this game supports the community workshop will only increase the value and fun that you can have in this game. there are an amplitude of scenarios and missions that can be done and will have you pulling all nighters quite a bit. probably one of the most popular missions files that are available is alits life which is an rpg gamemode where you can either be a cop,rebel or normal civ. there are hundreds more missions to be played and this game has gone above and beyond my hopes and expectations of what this game would be. 20/10.",398.4

"as a fan of the arma series, its no surprise that i would love this entry in the series. combat is intense, with bullets and missiles whizzing past my head every living minute. as for the campaign, it is pretty well made, as you struggle to survive the onslaught of csat forces on altis. multiplayer is beautiful, whether it be competitive or cooperative. and finally, the huge modding community you can find on armaholic or the steam workship. if you have the money, buy the game. it is very much worth it!",615.8

"this is by far the worst campaign i have ever played. the only fun mission is the first one, the second one is absolutly horrible. you have to get to a camp in 10 mintues but there are 50 ai that are pro shots that will kill you instantly. oh yea i forgot to mention, there are ied/ landmines everywhere. the multiplayer is alright, i can only get in about maby 3 servers out of 200 update: i really like this game after playing it bunch. still the campaign sucks but the senarios are pretty cool. multiplayer can be fun if you get a good server. i like playing on patrol ops. anyways i give campaign 3/10, multiplayer, 8/10",38.1

"when i got arma 3 i was a little worried that this game would not be for me. but after putting over 200 hours into the game, i can safely say this game is an amazing video game and highly recommened it to any call of duty players as my self looking for a new way of looking at war games. arma 3 provides so much along the line of the base story, super fun multiplayer games, and also an awesome editor system. some things i suggest doing if you buy this game is finding a group of people to play with. because although this game is great by its self, it is much more fun with freinds. i have met alot of great people on this game that i play with constanly. another thing i suggest you do in arma 3 is try out the editor. you can make some really cool stuff with it. i have made around 6 missions that i can play with my freinds whenever i want to. now i am not going to lie there are some bad things about this game as well. for one multiplayer can get a little stupid sometimes along the lines of, well other players. there is also the glitches that pop up now and again. and if you really want to have fun in this game you better have some good internet connection and a decent computer. but all in all this game is pretty darn good and i highly recommend this game to war game gamers.",264.5
"unique game. this doesnt count as a shooter, its a military simulator, but with good reason. the term shooter is used loosely to designate any game with guns. in this game, understanding military language, logistics, and tactics is just as important as having enough ammo and good aim. i rate this game highly, but dont walk into this expecting guns ablazing and being an insane tank able to take down platoons of dudes. its for its own crowd, its up to you to figure out if you are/want to be part of that crowd.",544.5

"awesome war simulator!! multiplayer is the best when you are on a server with a group of people that want to play seriously, if not it can be a bummer. single player is fun as well as it can become more of a fps than a simulator. i call this game a simulator over fps because if you try to play it as a point and shoot game you will die in the first 10 minutes. highly recomend!!!",21.1

"ive been a fan of the arma series back before it was the arma series. starting with operation flashpoint: cold war crisis i was sold on this series and have been a die hard fan ever since. the arma series has always been more than the sum of its parts. the ability to create through the robust editor virtually any sort of engagement scenario you want and then play that scenario against other players or with them in coop is not anything you can find in any other milsim out there. -and make no mistake arma is a milsim. if you havent tried out this series but like the idea of being able to immerse yourself in a combat experience without long nights of firewatch while hotboxing a pack and a half of malboros then give it a go.",17.0

(you can only save once when on a patrol or mission and you will have to replay parts of missions over and over again) the wide variety of guns and vehicles is great, however the game engine in its current stake is far from complete and needs a overhall, very dissapointing. the game could be a lot better. mods help the game flourish and so does the community and server game modes. overall rating 6/10 needs a lot of improvement.",132.0

"sad to see how far bohemia interactive has fallen. dont buy this b$#@ s%$@ or the dlc, all dlc should have been in the game in the first place! arma 2 had chinooks in the game, for free, they released cart racing dlc before helicopter dlc.... if you do own arma 3 already dont waste your money on dlc, the community will mod more helicopters/islands into the game for free then bis ever will. just wait dont waste your money. stay far away",266.5

"i have owned this game for about 3 months now and i have almost no complaints about the game. you need real skill in the battle field to do good and you need good planning for an operation. 9/10 only because you cant go prone on stairs, this is a free world bohmia and if i want to go prone on on the stair then i should be able to.",123.4
"best game ever! needs some minor tweaks and i could recommend a few additional things that would make the game even better but if youre reading this section to find out whether it is worth buying --- i can honestly confirm that if you have a beaty enough pc this game is great!",287.3
"king of the hill is life... invade & annex is life... atlis life, is life... arma 3 is life 10/10 would recommend.",108.7
"im not going to say, buy this game!! because its not for everyone, if you like arma 2 or military, fps shooters (not cod, thats more like an arcade game) then yeah this game is awesome and is a leader in that market. if you think this game is full on, arcade style action packs bullets,bombs and metal flying all over the place, its not, but its just as fun as one of those games.",774.2
"the best shooter,tactic game i ever played i also love the editor to",369.3

"11/10 it may have bugs it may have  requirments but its got more mods like altis life, a3l and battle royale it goes on sale for like 17.99 you cant really get bored of it. played all of the arma series this one is optimised and graphics are beautiful. eleven out of f***ing ten",47.0

"best game i have ever played. the arma series is realy improving from arma2 to arma3. the graphics are superb, frame rate is good, overall it still needs some work on campaign and map design. i recently read a post from the mayor of altis and he said that it turend their peaceful little island into a battleground and that it showed a local buisness factory that is private and secret. overall i rate this game a 4 out of 5.",661.5
"dlc has gotten worse, the game wasnt even complete when they launched it. i do not recommend this game to anyone anymore, if you want what you thought you saw, please purchuse arma 2 and her expansion operation arrowhead, i saw the arma 3: karts dlc and i knew it was time before more people get scammed!",116.7
"got tazed and fined for driving 2km over the speed limit. 11/10 would play again.",197.5
"campaign is stupid hard. no coop. zeus is fun but only one person at a time. workshop content ranges from wtf ew no to that was really fun with a tendency towards the latter. dont get the game for a fun fps. get it as a military simulater: you take a bullet, youre dead.",68.4
"hey all, firstly game is awesome, but that one thing that has me pulling my hair off is the constant crash to desktop that this game does. it almost kind of feels like it is a extra feature. altis life rules!, (if i dont dc) still play though :) 7/10 (being generous)",160.2
"if you take arma 2 and remove the third-world setting charm (balkans, middle east, africa, etc.), solid background of already existing mods (ace, various total conversions, well playtested islands), and dedicated community of milsimmers and replaced all of that with pseudo-operator lolmagpul multicam pmc greek futuristic garbage you get arma 3. you should buy it if and only if these things in arma 2 were of gamebreaking value to you: lack of ragdolls horrible vehicle physics (though a3 is not much better) having multiple guns to handle attachments as opposed to simply attaching items to the gun the gear system in general minimal amount of physical positions (prone, crouched, standing) other than that, stick to a2. theres just more to do.",25.9
"very fun game, i will be looking forward to the full release",83.8
"awesome game if you like arma 2 you will love arma 3 despite the amazing graphics it plays pretty well and there is a ton to do. id say buy this game but at a risk of you may not be able to run it considering its such a cpu intensive game i hope you enjoy it like i have though have fun!",57.9

"bohemia interactive once more successfully improved its flagship military simulatior / tactical fps. software is still in beta but shows smooth performance and steady content creation by the community and also by developers themselves. this is an improoved and worthy successor to arma series, recommended to arma veterans as well as novice arma soldiers. enjoy!",171.8
"full of bugs, this is glitches galore, what little content there is seems unfinished and rough. its hard to call this a game and it doesnt completely qualify as a simulator yet. there are no collision mechanics vehicles colliding with each other or some objects usually ends with one of them flying off into the distance. i wouldnt recommend this game for 60$ not even for 40$ this was released as a full game months before it should be and were still waiting on a real full release, in the mean time they havent even added any of the old vehicles or equipment there is very little hope and id say the only salvagable content is the modding community which so far has kept arma 3 alive for as long as it is though most of the people who purchased it have given up. i want my money back.",366.0
"this game can appeal to every type of player due to its verstility and ability to be changed. if someone wants action they can make a map restricting players ar a.i. to that town for close quarter engagements. if someone wants to play a realsim server and wait for hq to get a mission, and assign it to squads after the recon team has gone to a nearby hill and marked enemy locations, you can. arma 3 is the most versatile game where anyone can find what they want to play. armas engine can handle a lot of people per server and still runs the game really well despite there being 40+ people shooting at each other.",4.3
"arma lll bores me :| idk. i thought id enjoy it more than i did. i actually uninstalled it. i wont go into details why i dont like it because no two gamers are the same. i hope whoever pays for this overly priced game, enjoys it.",9.0

"great sandbox shooter with vehicles and mod support. you can swim and dive. you can play it as a shooter or a tactical game. and you can play a lightning shooting god with mind control. whats not to like?",96.6
"spent 60 dollars for this game played it alot played the alpha and beta to test the game then today got battle eye banned for no reason and cant play one of my favorite games ever, it seems like bohemia interactive is so cheap they have to use battle eye, a screwed up hacker security setup that bans people who do nothing i was on yesterday play altis life then today i get on to go play with a friend i get a ban message, they are too cheap to use vac that actually works and doesnt ban people that do nothing it bans people that do hack and break the game i have also been banned on arma 2 oa and i sent a support message to battle eye, and bohemia interactive, and then i got a bot that messaged me back saying that i need to go to steam and i did i went to steam and i got a message from one of theyre support consultants an actual person not a freaking bot i commemerate steam for this and i scould bohemia interactive and battle eye. i will be missing out on arma 3 life, city life, battle royale, and many other fun game modes because i get banned for no reason by battle eye.",312.1
"arma 3 is a game changer. going from call of duty, to battlefield, to this and its on another level. started it up, joined a server and met up with my squad. we rushed and invaded a small town where we were ambushed by tanks and snipers. one of my teammates was screaming through his mic as if this game was real life. after 20 minutes of trying to figure a way around the ambush we all got killed by a helicopter and respawned. two thumbs up.",33.8
"you think you gonna shoot  in this game? you dont. you walk, you run. this is running simulator.",185.4
"definitely buy this game! 1. the amazing campaign 2. battle royale! battle royale is a game mode where you and a bunch of other players are pinned against each other in a battle to the death. everyone parachutes out of a plane and has to land on ground safely and find weapons to use. 3.altis life! altis life is a game mode where you have to basically have to survive on your own or with friends you can rob banks, kill people, be the po-po , or sell drugs what ever it takes to survive and get money!",49.0
"its still working on its multiplayer synchronizing but has a fun system to play at. for those who dont know its based on the future not the modern military today so if you wondering where your m4 is at, it aint here. overall a fun experience for those who enjoy military-based games (or rp).",256.3
"one of the best games i have played related to the military,there is so much you can do. the team work that goes on here in arma is awesome.",72.4
"this game is one of the best games i ever played but i highly suggest get a high end computer for playing multiplayer. but if you like tactical shooter games with 1st person/ 3rd person this is the one to get.",55.5
"anti-tank simulator. fences are the main weakness to every vehicle in the game. remember this. also trying to jump over a trash can will instantly kill you. 10/10",205.0
"its a really good game but i wish it was a bit cheaper",99.5
"there is really no way of explaining this game to anyone who hasnt played it. its awesome. its fun. its total freedom. its a community. its dedication. its tons of bugs and glitches. its the thing you want to do with your friends on a friday night. its blowing  up, cruising with technicals and flying in helos. its at the same time realism and make-believe. its frustratingly hard at times. its long intervals of doing nothing. its modding, modding and more modding. its fps drops. its only limited by your imagination. its even more awesomeness. hell, enough talk! buy the the godd*mn game!",459.6
"its really good i love it the community is great :d",116.8
"tis a beautiful game. except when i get killed by a tank from 3 miles away on a hill at camp rogain or something along those lines. many different game-modes to play, and a thriving community.",112.8
"best game for multiple reasons: the singleplayer is actually good which i did not imagine. the variety of multiplayer servers and game mode is amazing and can do so much, like role playing, taking over an objective and some other stuff. the differences between this and arma 3 is so different, like scuba diving gear and . anyway, overall, i think you should get this game if you are debating it but you may need a good rig to run it.",877.6
"recommend to anyone who likes any sort of combat game. has great balance of first person combat and vehicle (sea, land and air) combat. the weapons dont customise very much, but that doesnt matter so much as there is a very wide range of weapons and attachments. very well optimised and runs smoothly on all occasions. the only problem is if you are playing online with a computer running at low settings, as you cannot see enemys as clear or as far away as those with higher grade computers can, and sometimes becomes annoying. but the game is worth the purchase just for the campain.",86.9
"great game id pay $100 for this! its a must buy if you like real life type shooters.",491.2
"great game. it starts of boring at first (well for me as i havent played arma 1 or 2) but then you get used to it and you start meeting people and coming up with tactical plans to take out an enemy base. you begin to build your own squad with your friends. there are differet game modes such as altis life where you can choose to be a cop, rebel or a civillian. you can then start a gang with your friends and start making drugs (create your own empire like heisenburg). you can basically do anything. arma 3 is such an amazing game and you will have problems with it at first but you will grasp it. you will always find something new to do with your friends. all in all i would give this game 10/10. great tactical play with realism and really throws you into the action. this is nothing like the  call of duty franchise or any other shooter this is unique.",23.6
"if youre looking to implement tactics, this is the game by far. i highly reccomend this game to anyone wanting to escape the mundane fps genre.",959.1
"a realistic army sim, not for the kids that enjoy call of duty. bloody amazing though.",92.3
"very good game all the dynamics are amazing and the graphics, wow phenominal!! thumbs up!",671.3
"i love the game but sadly my computer doesnt have the right specs to just play it for as long as i want ive only played for 13 hours/ 45 minute rounds because thats how long it lasts hopefully i can get a new computer and play this game as long as i want but other then that the game is great and really fun with friends!",21.9
"this game comes with tons of mods you can play like alits life, wasteland, breakingpoint(dayz) and epoch! awesome graphic awesome gameplay awesome realistic! 11/10 tire would blowout with net fence again!",638.2

"could easily have an 1000 hours if i didnt work and have a job.",511.5
"bohemia interactive made their debut with operation flashpoint and then changed to arma series afterwards. since the first installment it has been downhill up to third one. the engine is heavy, unoptimised, clunky for smooth gameplay no matter what setup you may find for your pc. the menu and ui interface is also archaeic and still as slow as it was in ofp days. i cant see justification for this game unless it would be around 4,90 and even then its not worth your time. the map is boring and unimaginative compared to that of chernarus, sahrani and the multiple locations of ofp. as for gameplay the shooting is well done and the many ways of controlling your character is definitely the best of the industry has to offer. its unfortunate that the teamplay and coordination falls down to its own clunkiness. finally the modding is still there which offers replayability and whatever people come up with to use but still i find the engine and other problems within the core too deep to actually be worth of ones time.",11.4
"this is an awesome game to play. the developer team is really caring about the community. the workshop and map editor helps you to do a lot of things that no other games can. the hardward requirement is pretty high and you will not get the best experience if you can only run on low or medium. plus, if you one of those people who play cod or battlefield a lot, you may need a few hours to l2p this game. arma 3 is seriously an simulation game, any gun can pretty much 2 shot or 1 shot you at any distance(and the ai is pretty good at aiming). stay in cover, move quick and you will enjoy this war on the island.",18.3
"i found this game to be very fun and i really recommend it for people who have the time and patientce. couple things i dont like though... 1. its in the future. (i dont like futuristic games) 2. you have to pay for more snipers and helis. 3. its really hard to kill people unless they have fatigues or civi clothes on. 4. no instant death on headshots i really recommend this game and i also recommend for anyone who buys this game to get the karts dlc.",286.4
"from what i played of it i had a ton of fun especially in the multiplayer, it was all out chaos and i couldnt stop laughing i had a cop strip down and run into the ocean while firing his gun in the air and then someone drove their truck into the water and killed him. 1510 -ign",1.8
"its a very realistic simulator one of the best and with pretty grapics but with its price i would only recommend this game to people who will play it often",391.1
"very buggy, but beautiful, tactical, realistic, adrenaline intense action, many weapons, cars, helicopters, boats, airplanes. one of the best simulators with big landscapes (open world) with many places to hide and plan advanced ambushes. enjoy!",1008.3
"so many different games to play.. buy for a great time and endless nights of fun",157.9

"an excellent military simulator, has a large learning curve and requires patience inorder to to become skilled at. like most multiplayer games, arma 3 works alot better with friends becuase it allos for you to have more coordination, which is a very important factor in arma 3. its fairly system intensive , but has gone through alot of optimiztion patches, but you should still look into the system requirements before purchasing. i would highly reccomend it, especially if you have friends to play it with.",13.5
"the game is fine the only problem for it is that its server dependent meaning,.. you need to find a good server in order to have a good game... it lacks offical game servers.",55.0

"one of the best games out if you ask me. if you love military shooter games and love to actually play as team and not just play some type bf or call of duty where you just run around shoot  you will enjoy this game. campiagn is a decent lenght(if you play on the hardest settings it will take you weeks lol) but the mp is where the game shines. i personallly play on co-op servers that run invade and annex or patrol ops and its almost like playing a real war(i highly recommend the 7thcavalry co-op servers). you do get the mp servers that run stupid  like wasteland(dayz rip off but worse) or atlis life( sims ripoff) but thats not what this game is about. do you love the thrill of hearing the bullets fly past your head or want to pilot a transport helio or attack helio giving the ground forces some cover and take out the armor or maybe you want to jump in a tank to lighten up the enemies forces or a artillery vehicle and use the viop to have the forces closer to the fight mark or even use there laser guided scope to spot targets and light them up. this game has finally fillled the hole in my heart for a real war shooter that i have been begging and praying for the last 20 years. this is the closeest game you will get to the real thing! i highly recommend getting this game.",181.8

"this game is a must have if you like milsim. it is very realistic, and has a great community. wasteland is for those who enjoy killing everyone in sight even if they are wearing the same camo. deathmatch is meh. coop missions are some of the best game modes. if you are new to the series, check this out, the controls are a little strange at first, but you will grow to love them.",570.2
"i have to admit i was hating this game in the beginning. i couldnt understand why i kept dying. i couldnt get the controls down and everything felt way to complicated. then a few weeks ago i decided to sit down and learn the game. as other reviewers stated this game is not call of duty or battlefield. you have to be patient. you have to learn the weapons and vehicles. this game is worth every penny as long as you invest a few days to learn the controls. add in steam workshop and other mods (breaking point is my favorite) and you have a fantastic war simulator.",43.8
"arma 3 is a good game. that if you havent played arma 2. this game doesnt have the same feel or the same look as arma 2. arma 2 is a better game in almost every way. this game feel likes it was cut short. it doesnt feel done. anyway, if you want a good arma game, go ahead and get arma 2 and operations arrow head. not a bad game, but arma 2 is much better. oh, and my i add this game is an fps hell. it doesnt play well at all, and its looks awful doing so",70.7

"bohemia have really stepped up their game. i got this while it was still in alpha. felt like arma 2.5 at that point. come now to the release of survive i cant wait for more. imagine that, the story of a bloody arma game has me engaged as . i am only talking about survive, not multiplayer. this is so much better paced than arma 2 was. graphics (minus far terrain) are brilliant. also of all things, pacing is amazing. when choppers start flying over, it has impact. when a mortar hits nearby, it actually has impact because they are not being spammed. there is an idea of scarcity, and it makes you feel like such an underdog. and that is ing brilliant. the feel of control of your guns fells so much better. the sights are also very nice. many improvements over arma 2. overall so far, this is a massive improvement over arma 2, keep this up bohemia, i am really starting to like you guys",32.3

"incredible co-op. good community. best fps game i ever owned.",279.5
"in my opinion, much better than any of the previous arma games. first and foremost where do i start? the animations, the graphics and the physics are all improved perfectly and it just feels like you are at war! the optimization gives you much more freedom to tweak graphical settings. the co-op just has to be the best feature, knowing that everyone depends on you and you depend on everyone as a team.",67.9

"if your stuck with csc and battle field then your missing out on great millitary games go right across you deadly cross hairs because arma is a more realistic simulater of battle so if you here a single pop or crackle you may experince the real army feeling of fear. arma 3 contans great single player and multiplayer action with multible modes to choose from my personal favoret altis life which is and rpg mode. arma 3 also has realistic shooting (as in not so easy to hit someone) with out being careful. i suggest arma 3 to any 1.",261.1
"this will probably be the only arma review i will ever write considering my opinion on these games remains largely the same across all iterations. bohemia interactive relies on their   licking modding community to make these games playable. everything in this game feels lazy, unpolished, and mexican made. the servers lag all over the place and the playerbase consist of 12 year old children and autistic 400 pound mouth breathing neckbeards. this game is a #dontgiveyourmoneytoincompitentlazydevelopers out of 10.",33.3
"amazing game it is very realistic and very awesome i recommend it",584.6

"i know there are a lot of nerds out there that seem to think that pressing 187 buttons just to take aim, is realistic. this is your game, not mine. cos this sucks so much balls, i think the devs would have no problem sucking a golfball through a gardenhose. it sucks more than a vietnamese  on xtc. it even sucks more than my dual stage vacuumpump. the flight model is appalling (im a pilot, try this  in anything that resembles a helicopter and they will be scraping your guts of the tarmac. the interface feels like a failed half life mod and reminds me of the days when i still had a 386 pc with 4mb of ram you have been warned. this is yet another game screwed up, most likely because of steampressure (get it?)",0.7

"dont get me wrong. i love arma 3. but the bootcamp update crippled the game for infantry. i know its supposed to be a milsim but honestly, i dont see how a trained soldier with a mainly plastic rifle, a few mags and the standard military garb cant run for more than 10 seconds without nearly dying of exhaustion. the ai apparently gains sustenance from the bullets you fire into their flesh and now take more than 6 shots to the chest to down, whereas your character will move like hes soiled himself if a bullet hits the wall 10m away. tl;dr: the editors good, the vehicles are responsive and fluid, but the stamina system is the worst one i have ever seen in a videogame. id recommend, but only if you prefer vehicle combat over infantry.",130.0
"the quintessential first person military sim for the seasoned military shooter fan or first-person shooter players looking for a bit of depth and substance in a game. this aint arcadey casual rambo cod or battlefield rubbish folks. this is the real-world modelled experience every fps player *should* be looking for. and if you havent been... you need to take a long hard look in the mirror and tell yourself to lay off the drugs.",112.1
"in the tiny amount of time i played (it was a free weekend) i had a lot of fun. it started i was commanding a squad of 2 not including me. we were driving in a submarine to get acroos enemy lines undetected. we got out of the sub with scuba gear then swam on shore and the mission was going fine. we were supposed to rescue a hostage that we knew was in the building about 500 meters away and as we were getting closer, my medic got shot... i had my other rifleman get into a house while i dragged my dying medic into the same house. i got inside to see my medic bleed out before i could patch him up. that filled me with rage... i sent my rifleman to go cover me from the hill when i found a lav. it was perfect. i hopped in drove picked up my rifleman and we drove into the town straight to the hostage running over and shooting past death every single enemy that was in sight. 11/10 would kill whole village for medic again.",2.4
"endless replayability. pretty much requires that you have friends to play with though.",97.0
"this game, it might sometimes be glitchy and bugs might arise everywhere and you might look dead when your really not, but it really does come down to how epic this game can get, full scale tank battles with air support and noobies everywhere with overpowered rocket launchers... thats my vision how of epic this game can get. but thats how i like it, you make it what ever you want. being a sandbox only limit is no nukes, ;d but that would be way overpowered, just imagine n00bies setting off like 100 nukes.. i dont think anybody would enjoy that. :l 10/10",218.0
"this is by far the worst campaign i have ever played. the only fun mission is the first one, the second one is absolutly horrible. you have to get to a camp in 10 mintues but there are 50 ai that are pro shots that will kill you instantly. oh yea i forgot to mention, there are ied/ landmines everywhere. the multiplayer is alright, i can only get in about maby 3 servers out of 200 update: i really like this game after playing it bunch. still the campaign sucks but the senarios are pretty cool. multiplayer can be fun if you get a good server. i like playing on patrol ops. anyways i give campaign 3/10, multiplayer, 8/10",38.1

"if youre looking for a great game to give you some adrenaline, then arma 3 is the right choice for you. warning: this game involves massive team work on a large scale, if you like playing alone then this game may be too awesome for you. but other than that, work together to succeed! ( it is singleplayer, but i dont recommend playing alone ). war has never been accurate in a video game like it is in arma 3. instead of run & gun combat, you experience patient and heart pounding moments knowing the fact that if you die in a mission, its a game over. work with your friends to find advantage points to your enemys and call air support if a tank has you under fire. and if you get it in maybe the leg or arm, you can always bandage yourself to avoid bleeding to death. many missions usually last many hours so be sure to have nothing to do during the day and time in your hands. and if arma still feels like its missing something, visit",101.1

"this game is amazing. i tell all my friends about and they ask what kind of game it is and i tell them, a combat simulator. you dont go in to this game with a mini gun and kill everyone with one shot. the damage is realistic. if you shoot someone with a pistol to the head they will die. i was playing on a role playing server trying to cause a ruckas and i shot someone to the upper chest area with an assault rifle and they died. this is the game to play! massive maps. role playing, team death match modes, capture the hill modes, coop missions, seperate zombie mods (breaking point). this game should be a pc gamers bible. always on their side and preach it to others.",168.6

"at first it was not like any war game. it was one of the worst. then i played it a bit more. i do not believe love on first sight, so i built it up. now i love this game more than any other game! you just need to find your favourite game modes (that players have scripted) like king of the hill or altis life. everyone can find their own! just make sure you do not play alone. fighting alone in war is not fun! also, i strongly recommend using your brain to come out from difficult situations. 360 noscope will not help you in arma.",680.0
"very fun game, and gets better with higher graphics. if your computer can run games with really high graphics, and you enjoy playing games like arma, then definately go for this game. my pc has decent specs with minor touch-ups here and there, and it ran fine for me during the one weekend it was free to play.",14.3

"this game is very intertaining. you can have lots of fun by playing the campaign or online. i find the best thing to playis the mod breaking point. this is a dayz like game that has a lot less problems. you can pick a faction each time you die and respawn.",21.9
"you can kill someone by dropping an airlifted ammo crate on their head. nuff said. 11/10",290.6

"cool game , but at the same time need powerfull pc and some mods are weird !",20.1

"even though i only get 15 fps in a city/town and 30 fps in the countryside on this game, i still think it is one of the best games i have played. it still has some work to be done to it but thats just what the series is like, a bit glitchy. some of the good points are 290km map with no limits, its a sandbox so you can do whatever the hell you want and a quite good campaign (well, thats what i think). some of the bad points are that it is quite boring for some people. it can run pretty well on pcs without having a very good graphics card. (i have a amd radeon 7730m 2gb graphics card and a i7 core in a laptop and i can run the game!) this is one of my favorite games from one of my favorite series and i am glad i brought it. 9/10 if you like sort-of realistic first person shooters, then i would recomend you get this game.",253.9

"arma. no questions. just arma. real review is down there arma 3. in a nutshell, imagine being in a wide open area with lots of grass just before sunrise. now, a helicopter flies over your head, and ground troops march past you, guns drwan and pointed at a town futher down the hill, along the coast line. gunfire breaks out. now your running through the streets with shots from friendlies and enemies ringing out all around you as you try not to hyperventalate. you spot an enemy. he has a lmg and is suppressing some of your guys on the other side of the bridge. you pick up your gun, steady your breath, and... bam! one shot. also lots of explosions. and fun.",345.1
"i like this game, a lot...but im very concerned of why bohemia wants to keep adding stuff in this game instead of working on the optimization for multiplayer, i get about 40 fps in campaign on very high settings, but when i go into multiplayer...the fps bomb drops. ive tried working on the coding to boost the game but nothing works. i hope its fixed",18.4

"a2 but with all bugs fixed, well most, but im very upset that i bought it at the beginning of the week and wasnt thinking of steam summer sale, and now its $20 less. grrrr. but yeah this arma is way more realistic, way improved, weapon customization, smoother gameplay, and if you are really looking for some tactical realism, this game is home to the most serious gaming clans. but hey its $40!! buy it!",16.4

"quite an amazing game. definitely one of the most realistic milsims out there that isnt marketed towards people that are actually in the military.

"easily the most intense and realistic first person shooter ive ever played. the multiplayer is tactical, intense, and gives you reason to play smart and avoid death. not for the average call of duty or battlefield player! this game requires much more patience and is for a more serious/tactical gaming mind. its worth the money!",62.6

"first thing first, friendlies; i play a majority of epoch at the time of the review and i have trouble finding people who want to be friendlies, even if im hollaring at them telling them that i am a fresh spawn and not to be scared they just stare.... then shoot. first game i ever played though was of wasteland and i met up with on guy who quickly made a group with me and we went driving around in a boat trying to get to a heli crash, opposed by a sniper on a hill about 1km out, and in the dead of night... that was quite fun. now i spend my time playing battle royale and building a base in epoch, which is still great fun but i still recommend getting a group of guys or girls together to get the most out of this. walking simulator? definitely, but if you ask anyone they will probably say that it is offset by the overwelming sense of adrenaline when you come across an enemy. i should add that this game isnt meant to be fun, if anything its exhilerating as its a war simulator not a game and makes you feel as if its your own life instead.",90.6

"its o.k and all but i really think some things need improvment. the sprinting animation is really unrealistic for me and when you play the game on minumin graphics, you get these weird light glitches across the sky. also for $60, i think is too overpriced. i got the arma 2 complete collection for $40 and thats better value. the gunplay in arma 2 is somewhat realistic and the running animation is a whole lot better plus you can get dayz free of charge. overall im a little dissapointed with arma 3, i wouldve thought it would of been better. 5/10",13.0

"arma 3, successor of arma 2 and arma 2 : oa, is in my opinion the best arma game yet released. arma was always known for its moddabillity and the users freedom to create their own missions, since bohemia interactive released arma 3 tools modding became even more easy. there are many really good mods out there, some are as good and big as a whole dlc! the game without mods is also good of course, the campaign was well designed and there are many fun multiplayer missions, which you dont need mods for (only few actually need mods).everyone who played arma 2 or any other arma game, and liked it for its tactical depth, its moddabillity, all the multiplayer missions or for whatever reason this game is defenitely worth its money. a note to all dayz fans : dayz epoch (the most popular dayzmod version since somewhere in 2013 i think) is comming out for arma 3 somewhen, at least they announced it, only closed alpha when i last checked. tl;dr ? a good game !",198.9

"best military experience game ever made, graphics are way too perfect.",77.0
"although it has a few issues with netcode, like its predecessor, arma 2, it is a well structured game with modding in mind. this game also possesses quite an arsenal of weapons accurate to their real life counter parts; furthering immersion. what does take away from this is the aformentioned issues with lag that can lead to some rather frustrating moments. i would recommend this to anyone who has quite a lot of patience and those who want to see what real life gun play is all about, short of joining the military or buying your own. 7/10 game",106.2
"ok first off holy crap this game is sweet. if you cant pay the normal 60 bucks wait till it goes for les( i got mine for 30 i think) i would call it a military simulation with a shooter twist. a great game thats lots of fun. you can be seriouse and treat it like its real life or just  around like i do most of the time and blow stuff up. if you liked dayz in arma 2 there is breaking point wich i play and that is pretty good but can get a little frustrating. but over all 10/10 would buy again. seriously if your pc can handle it get it.",362.7
"the game does have some pretty minor glitches but other than that arma 3 is a great game for community development. devs out there create some pretty fantastic mods and addons for the games because of the huge open world maps and functions bohemia interactive provides in arma 3. many people buy this game just for the amazing addons to the game which allow very unpredictable scenarios to happen. arma is intriguing to me because the game is unpredictable. games that are unpredictable are more of a way for players to choose how they play and gives a slight immersion. there can be scenarios where you see a heli crash onto a building which is 100 meters away and that building had one of your best soldiers now knocked out waiting to ambush the enemy who is surrounded with opfor. what do you do? arma is fantastic because its your choice of how you want to play the game where other games have straight up orders to do stuff, why would you want to do that? i would give this game a 9/10",493.7

"if ur buying this just for the campaign specifically dont get it, its impossible and i only play on regular i play most campaigns on veteren or hard im not bragging but im an alright player,however, the multiplayer and mods are amazing the world is absolutely huge and there is two islands, also it is the most authentic military simulator i have ever seen and the graphics are just stunning if your pc is up to the task",4.9

"arma iii is a combat simulator. it creates an envioroment where you can perform and learn the basics of the movement of a military soldier. the campaign is really good, there is nothing wrong with it at all except from where i find it hard at some cases. but overall it holds a realistic simulation of how its like. i also love multiplayer on arma iii. people can transform co-op gamemodes to a realistic enviroment in multiplayer, like some people can form squads and they like to make it look like a real squad which contains planning, tatical, commands, things like that. it makes the game look real. arma iii was released 7 months ago but grows a better game each time. there are certain amount of bugs and glitches in it but its very rare the bugs or glitches occur.... the game is quite expensive i know, its 35.99 but its good to spend money on a brilliant game like this. if you want to spend more on it you can buy digital deluxe upgrade for 8.99. i recommend buying the deluxe edition for 39.99, make sure you like what you are buying of the deluxe edition. when you buy this game i hope you have alot of fun. thanks!",384.4

"the game is a beautiful piece of art many times the size of the skyrim province. arma 3 has a few genres incorporated for our entertainmentbut the two main are military simulator and flight simulator, personally, since finishing the campaign i have been playing the dead nation mod and im totally immersed. more so than skyrim. more so than any game ive played. its worth its money and even better if you get it when its on sale. if you cant wait then look around for a cheaper new sealed hard copy on amazon. its hard to be good at this game so bad losers beware :-)",209.9

"bought it in alpha for wasteland after enjoying it so much in arma 2. not too much was added when it went through beta and final release. now with zeus, battle royale and a lot of other addons and mods coming it, there is too many reasons to list to buy and play this game. ive easily sunken another good day off from work just playing zeus with my clan.",370.6

"the best massively open world first and third person shooter i have every played. arma 3 makes call of duty advanced warfare and battle field 4 look likes child play. the amount of detail in all there helicopters, tanks, troop transports, characters, weapons, maps, lighting, effects, go-carts is overwhelming! sometimes when im flying over a city getting ready to para-drop into a hell fire of tanks and jets, i feel like im watching a hd action movie of the year! i dont what i love most about this game the most, might be laying in the grass on a hill a mile away from any conflict staring down my scope of my rifle calculating the wind and the bullet drop, then taking the shot. no game has every made me feel so rewarded when i complete a mission. amra 3 missions are not these 5 minute deathmatches there long fought out high action battles. also there map is so big its insane, and its not just one island, theres others that are insanely big, i cant even imagine how long it would take to go from one side of the main island to the other flying in a helicopter going over 200+ miles per hour. lastly very unique complex non-repetitive terrain. love it, care for it, buy it!",281.9

"i would reccomend, i mostly play altis, king of the hill and i tired to play battle royale (royale with cheese) with no luck. i will try to do so again. its fun, much better than arma 2 in my opinion, some would disagree... each to their own. cars would be better if you could control them better, as well as them not breaking if you tap something. would buy, but only if 50% off like i did in the summertime sale. this game is not worth the full current price of 35.99 or the deluxe version of 39.99. so i suggest waiting for the winter or summer sales. but non the less still a good fun game, even if you are playing alone, if you have friends to play with, im sure its much more fun!",15.7

"i know most people say this is for only really hardcore gamers and while that may be, im not the most hardcore gamer, but ive had loads of fun playing altis life and several of the other game modes like battle royale. 8/10 would reccomend to most people but the game is pretty unoptimised (atleast in multiplayer)",20.2

"seriously, its not your average battlefield or call of duty shooter... far from! this is real war simulation what all possible factors included! if you want to wage war like a real soldier in life-like situations, this is a game for you. this game however has many different controls and doesnt exactly have a user-friendly control because you need to press multiple buttons mostly to even execute one action, apart from basic movement and such, but if youve ever played any other bohemia interactive game, you should already know that. other than these hard-to-master controls, this game is truely amazing, breathtaking, and even lets you use an editor for putting together your own missions. i personally like it for combat flight simulation.",19.5
"scouted the map as a seagull. 10/10, would scout again.",571.7
"i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone cause its a multiplayers worst nightmare. the engine is old as , the fps on my new alienware pc is 20fps in multiplayer. un optimized piece of crap people, i bought it in beta and it still sucks. if there were a demo i could of saved 44 dollars but got screwed in the ! save your money maybe take a date to a nice resteraunt, who knows maybe youll get laid. anyways im saving you from a bad decision!",21.5
"totally great fps concept. it just does not seem to flow perfectly yet when interacting... also, online there is a lack of south african servers. so playing online isnt an option for me yet. the ballistics is super realistic, so i am loving that. few things like throwing grenades that dont quite look right.",61.3
"as an arma veteran, i personally recommend this game to anyone who likes the arma series.",220.7

"i love this game. its got the realism, heart pounding action, and community that i love. however, it does have its faults. its main one is its multiplayer fps. in single player i get between 80 and 60 fps depending on how heavy the action is, but the moment i join a multiplayer server (even one i host myself on a blank map) it struggles to stay over 20 with the same settings in the same areas. i have a pretty beefy rig as well, so unless you have a true monster, be warned. my specs cpu: intel i7-4770k @ 3.50ghz ram: 32 gb gpu: nvidia titan z os: windows 7 ultimate 64-bit",84.7

"arma iii is a game you cant just casusally play, you have to experience its rich graphics and amazing detailed simulation of battle. when you have a gun in your hand you seem to take better care of it and use the minimum amount of bullets to save ammo. they is so much to explore as there is a vast multiplayer experience filled with battle royale and team deathmatches. it really is a great and fun game!",3.4

"arma 3 is a good game, but it is still a work in progress. there are many bugs and glitches that will be punched out as time goes by, but that shouldnt keep you from buying the game. look at arma 2, it has become a huge success, mostly tahnks to dayz but its rp aspect. arma 3 is a truly next-gen game which is capable of doing so much. buy it, dont ask any questions, just do it.",2.1

"amazing, it is everything you wish they fix in arma 2 !!",40.4
"its an alright game not as good as the past installments but it does bring some new stuff to the table; improved graphics , more stances and better running animations. dont think that they should have set it further into the future just wrecks the immersive factor. also contains loads of bugs and frame rate issues. i would recommend buying arma 2 and arma 2 oa first before buying this becuase the modding community has not backed this game enough and as far as i know they have not added ace/acre mod and a propper vietnam usung mod yet.",107.0

"cant tell you if you should buy it or not, but i can tell you this. you will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have. but when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, its something magical you just cant find in any other game. arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. you buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. arma is a game which you can never called finished. there will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! ill give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back. read: i will not accept random friend requests! if you have a question, please post it in the comments.",919.3
"pros: -lots of vehicles -very very realistic -downloadable senarios -lots of controls (theres one to even salute and sit down) -a variety of weapons, it just so happens that 95% of the time i have a scar of some sort cons: -ai is terrible and dumb and slow! -shooting someone makes them to some kind of limbo back bending motion, looks really weird (whats up with that) -takes forever to get in the action on multiplayer co-op modes and i mean forever (really frustrating when you finially get on the ground then die or have a dumb pilot that crashes) -cant walk and switch weapons, like really? overall 50/50 but im going to recommend it beacuse a lot of people like it a lot more than i do so maybe youre one of those people",129.7
"i have fallin in love with this game. altis life is the best mod on this game. the roleplay and every situation is diffrent every time i long on. the flying, driving, diving, selling drugs, taking kindnies, robbing , minning and much more. the single player is alright but all the mods and the community make up for it.",284.9
"least user-friendly game i have ever played (or attempted to play). if you are an online gamer, good luck figuring out how to join a server. after spending over an hour trying and failing to play multiplayer, then searching google for a tutorial, its very obvious why this game will never succeed: its impossible to join any multiplayer server. stick with games made by professional developers and avoid this wanna-be bs crap",1.3
"pros: great graphics lots of stuff to use (clothing, weapons, vehicles, etc) huge improvement over character control from previous games ballistic system cons: terrible ai lack of standard game modes (most servers are either altis/stratis life or invade and annex againts bots) bad netcode can cause sync problems poor distance display handling (why is this overlooked in a game that relays on such a huge playground baffles me) should: decrease gameplay area (80% of the terrain is never used) include gameplay similar to that of battlefield 2: project reality. that kind of gameplay plus these graphics and contents = insta win all in all, a recommended game. could get some more pvp focused developing, but still plenty of fun flying, driving, shooting, etc.",260.0

"this game is amazing for the most part. the map is huge, and the combat is usually fun, but you will most likely have  fps. i would recomend this game, but even with a high end pc you will be at sub 30 fps in cities, making shooting people hard at this point, and can cause you to crash when driving at high speeds. this will most likely make you very frustrated. so until they fix the fps issues dont buy it.",67.6
"the best arma game iv played, it has beutiful graphics, great gameplay, and good addon. if you are looking for a game like battlefield or call of duty this game is not for you it a lot more realistic than those two, so you actually have to plan how to carry on a mission and watch what you carry, sound not fun but once figure out how to play its really fun i totally recomend it.",49.5
"fun gameplay, although the game isnt as expansive as i hoped it to be. story is nothing special, but i enjoyed most of it. if you are into realistic war simulators this game is a must, although $60 is a bit steep at the moment. if it were on sale anytime, itd be a good grab.",12.0

"ill admit, i was super excited to try this game out solely because of the depth of graphics and immersion portayed for itself. unfortunately, even with a high-end graphics card, the game averages itself around 15-35 fps on everything ultra; which barely seems fair seeing as how a gtx 560 is recommended, yet i have a 970 ftw! i know this is a big game, but it really sucks having to turn down the graphics just for a smoother experience but not having the edgy visuals that looked really awesome for this game.. i guess ill have to be more careful on how i spend $60 next time.. tl:dr my standards may be a little high, but if youre someone who can enjoy 30-35 fps for a pc game with lower graphics settings applied, then go ahead and see if this game tailors itself well to you!",6.2

"completely worthless game. textures dont load more that 100 feet infromt of you. controls are so unresponsive it is not worth playing. not even worth playing for free. this game missed its mark. all the nice landscapes and footage you saw in the video was cutscenes. total marketing lie",0.4
"i personally love this game would be better if more modes became available but it is basically a great game overall well woth the money",250.3

"the game seems ambandoned to be from the developers... has bugs and i cant find a multiplayer season with serious players to play. also a hell of the lag",15.3
"arma 3 is an absolutely fantastic game. the world feels natural and the situations you face in the campaign modes make you feel helpless and more like a regular guy, then a call of duty bullet sponge. the only thing you should keep in mind however, (and by far the worst thing about this game) is its absolutely terrible optimization. to get a stable 30 fps average, you will need a beast of a computer. radeon 270s and their competitors wont be cutting it for this game.",10.0
"this game is fun, looks great, and is just straigh up awesome. pros: graphics new vehicles new weapons sounds gameplay large maps ability to customize your weapons attachments ways to store more gear other than a backpack. ability to move fast while prone/ do other things while prone (inventory, heal yourself etc.) cons: it may seems like it is laking content, but there are a lot of things to do not as big of a population in players that there was in arma 2 the npcs dont seem to notice you as often so you can really just shoot them a lot w/out being shot at unless youre really close. this game still has more to come and i would recommend it.",53.6
"fix your game crashing on multiplayer. i would like to be able to play a game i paid for that worked perfectly before the last update. i have sent numerous reports to support, feedback, and havent heard anything. i know im not the only one having this issue, if your company would just read the forums.",413.6
"[do not read negative posts, they are extremely misleading] i went ahead and just bought it with the 50% off sale, and i wouldnt be angry if i had paid 60 dollars for it. it is a top game indeed with so much to do, it is more than a warsim, it is much more than what is advertised...dont think twice, just go get it! its definitely worth it. yes your pc needs to be somewhat good for this to run well but i was scared about this very same issue and turns out it runs amazing in ultra settings for me.",135.5
"felt like it could have been a very good simulator, but it turned out to be poor. played through the first part of the campaign and it was laggy in parts (which i have researched is down to poor optimization of the game) and i managed to get the vehicle stuck in a barrier and had to reload from an autosave. clearly, not well made. i also found the way markers really hard to see. either dont bother with them, or make them more vivid. i also found it hard to see the enemy, but thats just something i would need to get used to. to top it all off, the landscape is so boring. nothing but open areas and very little variation or cover. overall, great potential and if you like spending hours learning to play a more difficult game than cod/battlefield, then ive read that arma 2 is a much better choice. with that being the case, i cannot recommend this game to anyone.",1.1
"a (mostly) ground combat platform, widely open to modding fully customizable, not working in 3d vision, track ir greatly raises the experience",213.3
"arma 3 is the most realistic military sim ive seen. you can find no other game that goes in such detail with weapons than arma 3. though there is a huge lack of weapons and the maps are dull, empty, and boring, it is a good all-around game. what you cant find in the game you can find in mods although it can be inconvient since the since the arma 3 steam workshop only can allow 1 pbo and only 200 mbs of space. anyway its a great simulator that needs few improvements and steam compatibility but a great game.",745.8
"arma 3 gives me a hard on whenever i open it.just the smell of the cover makes me want to murder a puppy and piss on a newborn baby with cancer like cause iam just so indie like that. its like the love of my life i dont need a girlfriend because i have my arma 3 by my side. my non indie friend rory evans hates this game cause he is not indie like me. it gives me more to do around the house other than thinking bout ways to kill myself or how to make the news with the next big mass school killing.",2.7

"loved it! its a nice, opened world, and great graphic game. bohemia has yet again, blew my mind. when arma 2 came, i didnt like it due to lack of graphics and its complaintcy with the loot system, but they have helped it with arma 3. i cant wait till the people who made dayz start an arma 3 version of it :3. for anyone who wants to play it, its fun with friends, and by yourself, so have a whack at it and see what happens xd.",36.5
"after recently playing a lot of arma ii, mainly on the game modes island life and wasteland i decided that i absolutly must have this game, and when it went on sale this summer sale (2014) i snatched it up right away; and i can tell you i do not regret it a single bit! wasteland is a little different to what i was used to on arma ii after only playing it for a short while but fun nethertheless, zeus is where the game has really caught my attention! read up on zeus and give it a shot, you wont regret it if you want more depth to a shooter.",38.2
"its amazing, only problem is still, it lags unless you have an alienware computer, but on the positive note, it is a much appreciated game, with many cool missions, and tutorials for new players.",195.2
"at first this game was a lot of fun to play. but with the time it rather got worse than good. - the game does not go above 29 fps for me (on i7 4770k, gtx 770, ssd) - it easily drops under 20 fps when there is a bit of vehicle movement around the map - the ai is programmed really bad. not finding paths. not moving at all when told to. the game is just as good without ai as it is with them. maybe some dummy targets for your enemies. which again are overly op compared to your ai... - since the shutdown of gamespy it is completely unavailable for coop missions with friends. hosting steam servers was not working since the games release and last but not least the price is way too high for a game said to be still under development i regret every cent of the 45 euros which i payed for this game.",128.9

"this game runs well, plays well, and allows me to feel immersed in a realistic military survival scenario. did not get to play it long during the free period so to speak, but at the same time i still enjoyed my experience. i definitely plan on purchasing this game in the near future when i get the chance",7.3
"the best simulator and its called arma! literally the best game ive ever played",25.3
"i paid 30 pounds for a game that crashes every 5 minutes. i have checked forums and i have tried to fix this problem for the last month. i dont think the issue is with my computer. i dont mind any of the other countless bugs in this game but i draw the line when it crashes constantly. how am i supposed to imerse myself when this is constantly happening. i am gonna just stick with arma 2 which is a fantastic game and has already got a better community.this game is more then just a dissapointment, its unplayable.",77.2

"this game is an absolute must for anyone who enjoys tactical gameplay! on top of having amazing graphics it has a an amazing mission editor making it easy to make your own missions and keeps the game from getting dull. just like in arma 2 the relaism is still unsurpassed and truly amazing conpared to any other game out there. many co-op servers are full of serious tactical gamers keep the feel and realism alive in game as you play. a lot of the mods that were popular in arma 2 have carried over, minus dayz because of their new standalone being publicly available now. plenty of active servers to play on as well as endless amounts of tactical gaming communities or even just small groups of regulars that are friendly. just like on arma 2, communication still is a must in the co-ops also you just wont get the full experience this game has to offer if you don`t have a mic, nothing like using different, in game, radio channels to ask for help or ask for an evac. this is a great move forward for the arma series and will only continue to get better with possible add-ons as well as an ever growing and active community pouring in endless amounts of mods and missions.",54.1
"great game, tons of mods to choose from so ur sure to find something u like, wether its big battlefield style combat, or trying to run guns and drugs across the border, and of course zombies. great graphics, runs very well, nice and smooth, and brings a level of realism to shooters that is not seen elsewhere.",690.7

"normally i would say: arma 3 is not a good game. but that would not be fair. arma 3 has big problems. a netcode worse than the bf4 netcode, a poor framerate, at the very most an average campaign and more problems. but all that simply do not matter if it has one of the most active communities which is delivering extremely unique, exciting, funny, hard or just good modifications. and i like these kind of games. and there is the big strength of the game. unlike other developers bohemia interactive does not aim for the ultimate game. they deliver a sandbox where the players can decide what they want to do with it. you want a military simulation? well it is arma... but try other things: roleplaying in altis life, surviving in battle royale or driving a parcour up in the sky with skytrack - it is up to you. we have seen the success of dayz and i am looking forward to all the other mods which will be released in future. but: bohemia interactive! please solve the technical issues, especially the horrible desync and the poor framerates.",791.7

"arma 3. one of the games that is just so hard to review because of the many different ways you can go about it. lets just say, i recommend it if you like 30 fps even with a mid to high end pcs. very heavy on cpu and not very well optimised, but its arma. what you get is huge maps. love it.",293.2
"im going to be completely honest, i bought this game almost exculsively to play the battle royale game mod. as such, i have played very little of the actual campaign of vinilla experience. i can say though that if you like or enjoyed arma style games, you will appreciate the leve of detail and dedication to realism this series provides. the controls are responsive, and the guns handle amazingly. every time i died, it was 99% my fault and the other the lag i blame and curse over the microphone as i mourn my body. if you apprciate more realism to your games then straight up, over the top action, i would recomend giving this series a try. i did not mind spending the money and i bought this before the summer sale. i would highly recomend looking at the modding scene as well which is normally very active with arma series titles (look at the dayz mod)",7.8
"you like realistic military games? than this game is for you! arma series has impressed me yet again. steam workshop for this game pretty much adds a brand new game to arma 3. i use to play the deathmatch for arma or the coop for arma but now i find myself playing stratis life which is a life simulator. game gets updated a lot and adds new stuff every month. game is worth every penny pros open world military game everything is driveable small caves firefights are intense cons dlc are overpriced buggy",52.6
"this game has me feeling mixed emotions. you jump in to the singleplayer and find the game to be very tactical and have a lot, and i mean a lot, of controls. then you get into combat and see that its not as forgiving as other games. the challenge does make for some entertainment though. after you may want to check out multiplayer. youll find that there is tons of servers. most of them playing mods like altis life and wasteland. these are indeed fun. as soon as you jump in youll see tons of problems. none of which ive seen in singleplayer. the cars will be flying, animations crap up, and horrific frame rate drops. after all of this, i had a lot of fun. i did have friends to play this though. i would recommend this game, but it may not be as enjoyable without friends as with them. 8/10. all criticisms aside, its still a game that is worth your money.",56.8
"love altis life awesome for fps ppl and rp ppl your in for it too",152.2
"great for people who like realism, lots of realism groups for you to join to do this on a large scale, it has a nice community and with the addition on zeus mode the game is pretty much an open sandbox world for mission creators to play with. would definately reccomend picking this up.",223.5
"awesome game! wasnt too sure about it during the beta, but upon full release, this game is really awesome. there are lots of great planned (free) features coming out soon as well, which is great, as things will never get dull. the devs are activly updating and adding new content. if you are a fan of arma 2, you will love arma 3",17.6

"the overall experience you get from arma games is good. but bugs are to be expected. the game feels like an actual war simulator. one shot can either kill or hurt badly, medkits are must have and the missions are a fun experience. the game is reccomended when you have a couple of friends with you. it gets dull and boring if you are alone (like any other game) but with friends the whole satisfaction is improved.",58.6

"so i played this game when it was free for 3 days and i only played it for a little while. first of all the game was not very well optimized and i found it to be pretty laggy especially in multilipayer with around 50 people playing and bullets and missles going everywhere. i thought that this was a really releastic game becuase of just how many people there are in a game and how its like a big fire fight. i would have to say for people who have lots of money to spend on games, go ahead and buy it if you have a gaming machiene that can handle this game and get playable frame rates. (recommend an $1000 pc minimum) but if you play free games like me and dont have an extreme pc build i dont really recommend the game that much.",2.6

"this game is a great improvement on arma 2. first off the graphics on this game are amazing there are so many stunning sites to see as you battle across the islands of alits and stratis. secondly the voice acting has been greatly improved and it no longer feels like you are in command of robots on top of that squad command and high command has been improved making it easier to control large numbers of ai. the downside to this game over arma 2 is there is currently only one jet and there are no large helicopters for mass troop transport and the campaign is not coop which was a disappointment.",172.4
"military sandboxing at its best. i come from the very first operation flashpoint, aka arma: cold war assault. and from that one, to arma, to arma ii and now iii, all it has been are major improvements. combat, movement, vehicles, graphics, its just keeps getting better and better. game still lacks content compared to arma ii, but its community and potention do promise. this aint cod, battlefield or payday 2. god rambo and die.",137.7
"i do really recomend the game but the game is meant to be $50. i was looking at the arma website and converted it to usd and it said it was around $50. so would i say its a ripoff... no but i do think that steam should lower the amount. this game is worth it but steam just needs to look at that because i was playing the free weekend and it should have been like $25 dollars. i at that time had $20 so maybe we should ask steam to make a free full edition weekend where you could download it and keep it after the weekend finished...",33.3
"this game is great and i highly recommend it to players wanting a war sim or people wanting to shoot people. this game is massive and has tons of game modes to play online. the single player is more or less but still good.",3.9

"i pre-purchased this game before it even came out and here i am nearly two years later and this game is just terrible... arma 2: oa is much better. arma 3 is not terrible neccesarily becuase of the gameplay, i want to add its terrible becuase it just runs absolutly horrible on my computer for some reason i have no idea why... i can never get above 25 fps.... i have an amd fx cpu (8 cores @ 4.0 ghz) and an nvidia gtx 770 gpu... why does this game run so horribly bad?? dont tell me its cause i have an amd processor because that is not a valid excuse. even 2 years later this game is $60 and another $16 if you want two extra helicopters? its ridiculous! this game had potential to be a great successor to arma 2 but it just falls so short it isnt as fun, its runs terribly so i just cannot recomment it to anyone. another side note, i dont know if this is because of the low quality settings i have to use...but, the sky always seems like it is soo bright and washes out detials so bad arma 3 just look terrible. im so very disapointed in this game.",55.0

"i was never a big fan of simulators let alone military simulators, but the first time i played arma 2 i fell in love. although, i never bought arma 2 i did buy arma 3 and holy crap was it amazing. amazing graphics, an amazing aresnal, and an amazing game. there is many glitches and long waits to do a mission, but you can see through that and notice the beauty arma 3 gives. there is many fun game modes and even mods to spruce up the adventure. so, pick up a gun a helmet and get out there solider.",174.4

"probley the worst simulator ever made, full of bugs, really really bad optimization, op enemies even on recruit difficulty that can 1 shot you from the most ridiculous distances with no scope!, hidden mission timers that make the game feel rushed and unable to enjoy and to finish the game has the most  fatigue system ever! you can watch a film before your soldier gets up a hill. its a shame to see a game with great graphics & sound ruined by certain factors.......",9.7

"arma 3 is great!!!! let me just start by saying are you sick of the troll kiddies running around with the cheapest weapons and using an auto aim assist and killing you right away? i know i am. this game gives you an immense feel for war and keeps you thinking constantly. sometimes the action is spaced out quiet a bit but when the battle hits it is the gaming moments that stay with you forever. plus getting that mega kill is something to actually be proud of with your skill and not just stupid luck.",165.8

"i love this game so much. amazing graphics and the lighting is fantastic. the physics are still crappy just like arma 2 and arma 2 oas but whatever, i love them.",489.3
"so immersive when played in multiplayer with a proper team. map reading is just one of the real life skills you may need to use during battle, as well as using the radio and communicating with your team. also includes a great editor to make your own missions for multiplayer and singleplayer, and you can upload your own missions to the steam workshop",301.2

"disappointing on several levels. essentially youre paying $60+ for an engine that mods run off. the mods that currently exist are pretty underwhelming, and arent made by the studio. they have universally low production value, and there are only a couple that are played. the insulting part is the engine isnt even good. its pretty slow no matter what settings its on, and this is with pretty decent hardware. maybe if you can get this game on super sale it would be worth it, but the amount of content in this game in no way justifies the price",197.7

"this game is great, however you should get it with friends or join a clan right away.",901.8
"i loved arma2, sepnding endless hours building missions, and adding 3rd party content. initially arma3 was the same, although it could be a bit laggy.... and then out of the blue, the audio became very broken, stuttery and utterly disjointed, and the game itself started running at 7-9 fps, whilst complaining that bacause it was modded (its not) and that i may encounter problems (i am). ive uninstalled and re-installed, and can see zero improvement - despite all settings now put to low. sorry guys, not good enough. it makes me question the value of steam, as arma2 never had any such issues, and with steam, i no longer feel in control of whats going on, and what is, or had been, loaded. very unhappy.",37.4
"arma 3 is a very fun, open world game. it has an extremely large modding community, and is widely played by those throughout the world. it contains a scenario editor in which you can create your own missions for you and/or others to play together. it has a unique scripting lanuage, which is difficult to learn at the beginning, but is very flexible once you learn it. the community has much variation, from player age, experience, heritage, etc. and is a great game for those who really like combat/strategy.",336.3

"this is one game franchise ive stuck with since the start. back in the ofp days. the game has always deliverd with the best game play/simulation of any other like it. arma is worth its full price. sure it has some bugs, but the amount of fun this game can bring is well worth a few problems.",580.0

"arma 3 ... where do you start all the kinks of arma 2 have been cleared, the engine runs smooth... the animations even smoother and the optimisation is always on the up and up. throught out armas history it has been clearly building up to this. the arma game to end all arma games. if you are considering buying remember... this isnt a fast action shoot emup (but sometimes it can be) this is tactical and stealthy. also if you buy this game and need someone to play it with you ... hit me and the 45th up :d",206.7

"a pretty hard simulator to master for someone who is new to the series. it does, however, have an impressive world to explore and battle through but the game suffers from proper teaching (as it is multiplayer-based) so it is quite confusing for me and it has really dissapointing frame-rate performances; even if your rig is overkill. a tough game to recommend but it would be much more enjoyable if the game runs better and is more understandable. + immersive world + good teamwork + very enjoyable if understand - poor performance - somewhat hard to play, which links to low framerates a mixed thumbs up",16.6
"just like any other new release, it has some bugs, but they are being worked out. its a great game as far as im concerned. and as time goes on and devs tweak it as needed, along with the cool mods, this is my primary game to play of all time.",518.0

"hour after hour the game can be enjoyable to an extent but with the serious lack of software support from bi-studios the game is lackluster in how it performs compared to its previous game. they still since the launch of alpha have yet to create a patch for a simplistic bug and are lazy programmers in the least. it seems that the modding community has to pick up the slack of their terrible coding to fix not only simple coding issues but also the major areas just to be able to have good mods...... pretty horrible if you ask me, i would have expected alot more coming from bi-studios.........",493.3
"i personally like arma 3 for its mass potential. a lot of the people are great and the different gametypes create an immersive aura that you just cannot avoid. i plan on playing arma 3 for a long time, this game is extremely good. there is too much to talk about to really give you a firm grasp of what i am trying to say. the combat is more fun, movement is fluid, people are great. what else would you want?",629.9
"the best war simulator game that i have ever seen, arma 3 is a simulator game that has series and dlcs all around this game. i recommend buying this game when you have played the arma series. arma 3 has a mod that is comming out that is called day z where players have to survive in a world full of zombies and bandits. you can find loot, fight zombies, find vehicles and mostly. fighting bandits. you can trust anyone, but they cant trust you... - stevenisadork",55.3
"a nice simulator. unlike other games that try to give a warfare experience but instead give you a stupid cqc stage, in this game, it is do or die, you must team up, but you can give it a try to being solo, of course, it will not be like call of duty or medal of honor, it will be... an unique close-to-real warfare experience. the game has few guns, but they are unique and can make a difference. the variants are extended, making it a huge library of choices you can have. the bullets have an unique rendering, and you can have tracers (red, green.), which can be seen and can help to tell a nearby teammate where the enemy is. the vehicles are decent, most are sluggish and it does not really give you a civillian feeling, but it gives out most of the military feeling. many servers to play in, with different modes: altis life, co-op, zeus and so on. you can find a game mode you want, and with the huge quantity of modifications existing around steam and the internet, you will certainly never stop playing, unless tactics or marksmanship isnt your thing. 9.5/10",199.4

"11/10 realistic, immersive, amazing. desync and randomly exploding vehicles are still an issue though. overall fantastic work by bi!",464.1
"among many things my favorite thing about this game is that empty brass exits the weapon and makes a ping if it hits a metal floor, and that bullets are effected by spin drift/wind/ and gravity. tough to get it to run well at 5760 x 1080 but very emersive when it does. with all the bohemia content and user created content ported over from arma 2 its definatly worth the full price.",468.4
"with all the different multiplayer modes and missions, plus custom made scenario missions from the workshop, this game never gets old. it is a great game for hardcore players. the game is gorgeous. especially at night. i paid full price for this game and never regretted it. if you see it on sale, it is a must have for military fps fans.",110.8

"this game is fantastic if you enjoy games that require you to work as a team to complete objectives. grab some friends jump on a server and let the team building begin. prefer to go solo? well the campaign is absolutley spectacular. still not interested? you can always play with the mods that are always coming out and being updated. in short there is something for everyone.",33.5
"altis and stratis life are the best part about this game in my opinion. also the editor, spawning in jets or helis and flying them around. in altis life, my helicopter got stolen after i tried to say hello! to some guy in a ghillie. he asked for me keys so i just gave up there...",94.3

"the nato forces had us pushed back to our final two bases, i was stationed at the northern camp. our forces were beaten back hard, and we were scattered. i battled fatigue up the hill to get a vantage point looking down across the east from the beach to the mainland, i adopted the prone position and set up my lmg and scoped the area. thats when i saw it, a brown figure darting accross the fields below, performing evasive maneuvers the likes i had never seen. it was an intense 5 minutes, leading the target and squeezing the trigger to deliver a burst of rounds at my foe. finally my enemy took refuge (or so he thought) on a ridge nestled between two trees. i aimed precisely, meaning for this to end and took my final shots. i observed for several minutes when i decided to go and get a certain status on my enemy. as i walked up to the ridge i could not see my enemy in sight, so i looked around some more. it must have been 30 seconds until i looked down and saw his little b***** whiskers and his **** floppy a*** ears and noticed my god damned foe was a mother f******* bunny rabbit. 10.01/10 will definitely buy",130.4
"absolutely fantastic combined arms simulator. if you prefer realistic approach to military games, this one is for you. 2 beautiful open islands to fight on, many weapons and technical to use. what i liked over the older instalments is enhanced movement and stance system, where you have more stances to adapt to the enviroment.",106.7

"hell yeah i recommend this game. this game satisfies my thirst for fps games. the most detailed game ive ever played, in terms of actual in game mechanics. if you run too much you become tired, and aiming is much more difficult. if your hit in the leg, you might not be able to walk so you must crawl. the pain from being hit effects aiming aswell. most fps are very forgiving about death, which to me has always been a huge turn off about call of duty, getting shot in the back 24/7 and having a 1.0 kd is just fine, but they are not the only ones. killzone, halo, and battlefield (on team deathmatch mode at least) are just as guilty. this game is brutal, and dying on this game is inevitable, but when you do die you realize how important following procedure and knowing how to react towards a combat situation is. one wrong step and its over. instead of hitting respawn immidiatley after i die, i find myself just stopping and saying damn, maybe if i would of retreated or gone that way, or sent my unit over there, maybe i would still be alive. and then learning from those mistakes. very rewarding and educational experience. a+",232.2

"very good game ! a must for every gamer buy it now while it is on sale :)",81.4
"the* best military simulator on the market. its the only game where one or two bad guys at the right time, and in the right situation, will get your heart pumping. my go-to game. highly recomended to anybody who has played a military shooter and thought, i wish i could do x, and y. doesnt matter what x and y are, the majority of the time, you can do it in arma.",370.3
"best game ever! needs some minor tweaks and i could recommend a few additional things that would make the game even better but if youre reading this section to find out whether it is worth buying --- i can honestly confirm that if you have a beaty enough pc this game is great!",287.3
"the next generation military simulator (or how bohemia call it: sandbox game). i love the details and features like weapons attachments and the new clothing system. also the new helicopter flight system is just brilliant. although i never played take on helicopters before. its just a awesome moment when flying a littlebird with the new flight system and transporting troops. cant wait for the helicopter dlc. thanks for that masterpiece bohemia interactive!",881.4

"totaly worth the money there are many things u can do and even good things to do in single player i strongly recommend this game to people who like the realistic type of shooters",44.6
"best game ever, was on a rp server been playing for 40 hours on it and i got my first killed, he sent me a text mesage saying i should  my self i said to him you will be mine  and went to find him, after about an hour i found him and knocked him out and put him in my chopper, we flew off together and he asked what are you going to do with i said back there is lube in the back, get your self ready lets just say never to  with me",21.9
"literally sold everything in my inventory to buy this game. it was worth it 10/10",62.7
"while occasionally the game cna be frustrating and complicated, most of the time you can have all kinds of fun. warning: this is a sim not a game. expect realisim.",107.1
"this game is really good. i would give it a 9/10 and the reason i give it such a high rating is because there are endless things to do. such as altis life or maybe tactical missions but my favorite part of the game is flying. there is the standard flying which is sorta like a arcade flying but still has some realistic features then there is advanced flying. but besides that this game is just great before i had this game i was a lone wolf on arma 2 but on here i met a awesome group of people that i play arma 3 with every night we even have are own altis life server.",566.4
"it is a flat upgrade on all the things youve loved/hated about arma and arma 2. since theyre on the same engine, you could even import the arma 2 .pbos and have them work (sometimes buggily, of course). i cant wait to see how itll progress and how the campaign will go.",74.9
"very realistic and even my old pc from 2006 can run this! :) 10/10",120.1
"the minimum or recommended system requirements are totally fake, my graphics is nvidia geforce gtx 650ti, but i just get 20fps in all low settings...that is super super horrible, but the gameplay is excellent, hope i can back in one or two years to recommend this game!",112.1
"the game is so realistic that i have contracted ptsd.",111.6
"awesome game,and recommend it but only if you have a beefy computer or a gaming laptop.but other than that its a wonderful game and if u dont have a beefy computer like i have a normal laptop it kind of works but got to find a serer with low ping or with little people.",29.3

"at first i was like - (   ) but then - (   ) and then a bit after- (   )",204.3
"arma 3 and the rest of the arma series is best enjoyed with either a good organized and not so serious group or friends. since this game lives by its user created content there is an editor included that lets you create you own missions. let those be small or large, easy or tough, you are the creator. not to forget the steadily growing amount of user created mods. this game is a simulator (sometimes for walking long distances), so do not expect any arcadey gameplay, you get shot, you may live and treat your wounds or you may die instantly. tactical thinking is the key here and running head on is mostly the wrong thing to do.",506.4
"its a lot of fun how ever it needs a favorite server tab so you can find servers you like to play on easy but thats it",64.7
"do not buy this game unless you like to roleplay as a military dude or something. you will literally walk around for 8 hours trying to get to one place. if you really like that kind of stuff, why not just join the army ?",20.1
"i highly recomend this to any person that is smart and patient if ur use to cod and like it dont play this arma is way to realistic compard to any arcade game such as cod/bf3/bf4. one of my favorite games and alwats will be",55.1
"great game love the continued development of it also!",20.7
"so much fun. the multiplayer is so submersive, and the campaign is realistic as heck and not short either. if you love realism in shooters, then this game is for you",46.3
"arma 3 is a beautiful game it has realistic animations and much more! it is a open world combat simulater and you can move around the map by land, sea and air good luck on the batttlefield.",15.4
"the vast amount of game modes will keep me entertained for hundreds of hours and ive only played two of them! altis life is fun and wasteland mode is some of the most intense fps action ive ever played.",81.2
"from the outside looking in arma iii imitates the best and worst aspects of postmodern war. the vast majority of your time in this game will be frustration from shear amount of bordom, that is until a firefight breaks out & its the most intense game youve ever played. the juxtaposition between these two emotions is not unlike every headcam video of a soldier at war that are all over the internet, so if that at all interests you, id say buy arma iii.",35.7
"much better than call of duty and battlefield. this game does a very great job in immersing you into the environment. your team a.i. can get killed leaving you the only one left in the squad. the bullets snap and whiz around you. there are many choices of vehicles to choose from all with different roles and abilities. kinda wish there were more guns thats just my opinion but the fewer choices bring simplicity in the game. the underwater subs and scuba suits are also very awesome, totally wished they had sharks that would bring some thrills. also the graphics over all are sexy all over, pleasing your eyes with ic glee.",97.2
"this is the perfect military game and if you are into tactics and positions in a fight this is he game for you. with several thousand hours of multiplayer gameplay and dlc there is so much to do:)",26.9
"more like a grapical update for arma ii, not realy adding much else instead of adding what i thought bohimia would which was addign most of the features that the ace & acre did, (mods for arma ii)",46.1

"a big open wonderful military sandbox that is made even better by its active and passionate modding community.",412.7
"best played in first person for sure. the most realistic warfare game hands down. battfield and call of duty are awesome but just not nearly as realistic and the graphics on arma 3 are some of the best i have seen. amazing terrain detail that looks very real. the sounds are also some of the most realistic in a game ever. game is worth every penny.",276.3
"worth every penny, but theres still alot of improvement to be done like fixing the eject from moving vechile and stuff like that there just quite alot of little stupid bugs like that. but would recommend.",164.4
"heck say. dispite many bugs and some annoying things this game is just want i like. a tactical shooter without all the run and gun. single player missions are trash but mp and steam workshop makes up for it. the fans really make this game worth it.",197.1
"dont believe the neckbeards saying its a military simulator. its immersive to an extent, but a mid level cod player could drop in with no problem. you see guys you shoot guys. the difference being there 500 meters away in tanks with thermal vision.",189.9
"if you want ruin your life away aimlessly runn--err driving from place to place, hoping to god you dont get roadblocked by the cops with 4 people carrying as much herione as you body will allow, then this game is for you. if you like being those cops stopping those four people with as much cocaine as possible then this is for you too. or you if you like being clean and runnung salt, theres that too, for you. but really though, the mp is crazy, especially the altis (rpg) map, which is where these scenarios would happen. the campaign is really complex for you hardcore gamers who really get into and is very nice i might add. only gripe from me and its on my end is that my damn third person button wont work. so since its the free weekend and on a ridiculous sale (10/23-10/26) get it get it now asap and any other acronym you can think of for something speedy, its that good.",274.2
"off to a bit of a rough start, but all the core elements are sound and the engine has been done quite well. buy it not as a standalone game, but as a military sim platform - good things are on the way here.",138.4
"in my opinion, much better than any of the previous arma games. first and foremost where do i start? the animations, the graphics and the physics are all improved perfectly and it just feels like you are at war! the optimization gives you much more freedom to tweak graphical settings. the co-op just has to be the best feature, knowing that everyone depends on you and you depend on everyone as a team.",67.9

"comparing arma 2 to arma 3. arma 2 has more content, but arma 3 has more features. once it has all the content it will be fantastic",644.6
"this games engine is 10/10 in singleplayer, but once things go to multiplayer, everything goes to hell. after 417 hours im pretty much done with it. sick of the lag and desync issues on every server i play on. i have a fiber optic internet connection, and i7 4770k@4.6ghz, 2 r9 280xs in crossfire, and 16gb of ram. the game is also running off a ssd, that is solely dedicated to it. and yeah blah blah blah, its arma and its always ran bad online, but its only worth putting up with for so long. no weapons have been added to the base game since i bought it, there was one helicopters dlc that was okay. this games main selling point is mods, yet running mods on an already desyncing and laggy mess does nothing but make it worse and further the unplayability of it. so, until the multiplayer is at least being worked on to improve framerates, im out.",454.4
"its amazing, only problem is still, it lags unless you have an alienware computer, but on the positive note, it is a much appreciated game, with many cool missions, and tutorials for new players.",195.2

"fantastic gameplay multiple gamemodes to which you can edit them to your liking and personal interest..... great player base too",220.3
"this game is so much fun. dont buy if you have below a dual core though, you wont be able to run it well at all. i have a dual core and play it fine though, no lag or anything. this game is as close as it gets to real life and actually required skill, planning, and patience unlike any other fps on the market. if you are looking for the best fps/military simulator look no further. youve found it. its arma 3. 11/10 great game",222.2
"i love arma. but never in my life have i personally played it. i share my frustrations with you because i bought my very 1st arma computer game (arma 3), have had it for 2 days now, but still have yet to be able to play a single second of the gameplay.... it claims on steam that i have played for 72 minutes, but i have not gotten any further that then clicking play game. as it requests to make changes on my computer with microsoft directx and then crashes before the game itself pops up. i only hope that steam will be able to reply to my problems on steam support. although even from the gameplay, i recommend arma 3 to any and all computer gamers who wish to experience the closest thing to war. arma 3 is oneof the greatest games of our generation and i cant stress that enough. i cannot wait until i somehow get to play this game. i am so excited and will be playing fo 2+ hours a day guaranteed. kids play call of duty. boys play battlefield. men play arma.",6.8
"really enjoy playing this game. coming from cod and battlefield i love the realistic attributes to this game compare to the other two. battle royale is by far my favorite mode in this game",16.6

"this game is worth every cent. it is extremely realistic and has provided hours of fun for me and my friends.",10.1
"i dont know how to get in to severs it kicks me out all the time why ??",5.7
"the game does have some pretty minor glitches but other than that arma 3 is a great game for community development. devs out there create some pretty fantastic mods and addons for the games because of the huge open world maps and functions bohemia interactive provides in arma 3. many people buy this game just for the amazing addons to the game which allow very unpredictable scenarios to happen. arma is intriguing to me because the game is unpredictable. games that are unpredictable are more of a way for players to choose how they play and gives a slight immersion. there can be scenarios where you see a heli crash onto a building which is 100 meters away and that building had one of your best soldiers now knocked out waiting to ambush the enemy who is surrounded with opfor. what do you do? arma is fantastic because its your choice of how you want to play the game where other games have straight up orders to do stuff, why would you want to do that? i would give this game a 9/10",493.7
"for me this was in my list of one of those legendary releases of 2013, this is a perfect game for an open-sandbox reaslitic military shooter and has numerous gamemodes instead of just being the typical army type first-person shooter where you just do a mission shoot and its over. one thing is to make sure you have a great gaming rig because this is a very demanding game and is still going through some updates to increase optimization.",50.7
"not much i can say one of the best games i have played",18.3
"its a good game but it gets boaring after like a month or two... the basic game is pretty , but some mods like altis life or battleroyal keep it fun",478.4
"this is a great game and i wuld recomend this to anybody that likes a little more technical gameplay and not call of duty  mode. does not run like a charm but it runs ok with max settings (4670k 4.3ghz and msi 780 at 1180 mhz)",779.3
"arma 3 is one of my top 5 favourite games, it has 2 massives maps to play on. and millions of mod like breaking point, arma 3 life, battle royal and many more. overall this game is massively awesome so why not try it out?",159.8
"cant play it it keeps updating nothing im stressed out",49.8
"where are the crosshairs on this game? if there are any i must be getting unlucky and picking all the servers without them. i mean yeah ok graphics, but bad animation details, doesnt really feel like a shooter when you cant aim down the barrel of your gun, or even see your gun sometimes. the controls for this game are ridiculous, theres no need for all those controls, games not hard they just spent alot of their time putting useless stuff in it.",2.8
"this game was a bit frustrated after counter strike, but after a few hours of playing, i realised, it is not so bad. it is a totally different, and i must learn how to play this game. after a while, i understand, the flow of the game, so now i like it much better. i recommend this game, for those, who like open area combats, and slow gameplay compare to counter stike. it is more like real world.",7.8
"10/10 would sell csgo skins for this game side note : npcs have aimbot on lowest difficulty (on singleplayer) , but the end result is worth it",31.4

"an lovely game, my pc cant run it really good, but it is playable and i enjoy it a lot i already played since alpha and like wasteland in alpha nothing worked only the killing part and then weapons part but now its is so mutch better, the food and the drink works everything is fun, big map etc. sadly i got an really bad pc so it doesnt run withouth lag, but it is playable and a lot of fun :d",45.5

"i really enjoy this game. this game is different to other wargames. you can make your own missions, the graphics are epic and the maps are 200km big! you can play alone or with friends. either way you will enjoy this game. i suggest this game to anyone who is wanting good gameplay and epic battles.",692.9

"the best thing about arma 3 is the open ended content you can play on it, and you can get on a server with 10+ of your friends and play together against the computer or other people. the game has its glitches (network blips) that can be mitigated by going to a strong server host / game type and making sure you are close to it geographically. this is because the game world is huge, and you can see multiple kilometers away enemies running around and can snipe them from a distance or rocket their vehicle. i am glad that dayz got me interested in the arma series as i have had a blast with them so far.",296.1

"a fantastic military sandbox with many addons & mods to experiment with. it has its fair share of cons and pros, the cons laying mostly with the multiplayer aspect of the game. if you intend to buy this game, i recommend upgrading your cpu as well as your gpu pc specs (if yours dont already meet recommended specs). while singleplayer is a graphical  and is fantastic to play on maxed out settings, multiplayer youll find it the complete opposite. multiplayer i found is managable only if you can deal with the fact that you may have to play on low graphical settings. as a cpu intensive game for multiplayer, youll have to deal with lower fps and graphical settings if you intend to play on bigger servers. on smaller servers, higher fps is attainable as well as higher graphics. if you can deal with this con that arma3 bears in its mutiplayer system, then your time & money will be well spent on this game. away from the cons and on to the pros, this game is the best military sandbox out there. with arma3s many details and functions you can find yourself commanding a squadron of jet-fighters or leading a squad to capture a control point. the scenarios are limitless with arma3s steam workshop integration. all in all id give this game a 9/10.",805.5

"a very nice game alot of mods the altis life mode is the best. i give it 9/10 .",57.9
"i am really enjoying the altis life mod when myself and my friens are all online. king of the hill is a nice break for when you just want to enjoy a bit of fps game style other wise wasteland is also a nice mod that combines both the life and king of the hill but with no rules.",463.8
"this is the best game i have ever played. most of the people are very nice and will be glad to teach you the ropes.",15.2
"a well made military simulator with a great community. the game puts you right in the action during those tense moments when the bullets flying around you could kill you in one or two hits, making every battle decision worth thinking over. missions with a team could never be more realistic then when you are just a band of gamers who have never met before, hunched over your computers and just barely making a dent in the opfor forces. even when you are on the move to the action, the game still keeps your attention. the moments when you are completely oblivious, then suddenly ragdoll to the ground with the respawn screen popping up really teach you to be aware. overall, arma iii is an amazing game that made a lasting impression on me, considering im new to the series. originally buying it to play altis life, i soon found the rich treasure trove of content this game holds.",131.0
"if you like military shooters and realism, this is your game. only complaint is the mp as its not overly optimized at the moment.",145.1
"awesome. i loved arma 2, and this is like arma 2 but less clunky and lots of new mechanics and graphics. the only thing i think is holding this game back is the almost unimproved ai.",144.1
"first impressions with the game. download arma 3 check! play singleplayer passed.. go to multiplayer check! find a sandbox server check! spawn check! buy a vehicle che.... wait a minute... what am i hearing outside of this building? went to the door and as soon as i opened it i saw a frigging tank standing in front of me with rainbow colors!! didnt have time to close the door and i ran in the other side of the building. i was terrified. i heard that the tank was circling around the building and i had no where to go. finally i got out of the building and the thank started to chase me so i went back in. i bught uav and had no idea what to do with it. well apparently i didnt do right thing with it cause i launched a missile while i was on the ground and blow up my uav, my friends uav and 50k helicoper. after a while my friend came in the same building and he bought uav also. we hopped to the controls of that thing and my friend drove the uav right next to that tank and i launched the missile. went to see what happened and i saw this tank upside down on the ground. driver comes out shoots me in the back of my head and then i respawned. 10/10 would play again !",37.1
"i have been looking for a game like arma 3 since i started with shooters. i always thought call of duty, or battlefield 3/4 was the most simulated you could get without really going to war. this game is war. this simulator requires players to really try, it is not a run and gun game, you do that, you die. you need to be tactical, aware of your surrondings, and be prepared for anything, from a fireteam of men, to a sniper team, to tanks sitting on the hilll line. everything about this game is amazing. grapihc are awesome, if you can run them on normal or higher, the ai, and ragdolling could use some work. one con of this game is the ai, sometimes there smart, sometimes there dumb. they can get hit with a grenade at point blank range, break there legs, lay down and bandage, then get up and run away. over all, 20/10, would recommend to anyone who wants a good shooting simulator.",722.9
"like 2, except with equipment that would be too expensive to outfit all of todays modern infantry with. oh, and the swimming and underwater stuff is nice. it still suffers from frame rate issues, unfortunately.",57.0
"amazing game. truely unique and majorly realistic. 10 leagues above battlefield and about 500million leagues above any call of duty game. if a challenge is what youre looking for then the campaign on this game is such a challenge. even leading your own squad can be a challenege. almost everything is driveable. good array of weaponary. and if you play online, it only gets better with altis life and breakingpoint. even milsim. i recommend you buy this game and support the developers who actually make great games unlike the developers at activision and infinity ward who churn the same garbage out each year.",58.8
"very realistic, unlimited ways to play. i just spent 3 hrs driving a tank around the island just looking at the scenery. i havent even fired a shot yet and im hooked...lol!",5.8

"fun game, has a different feel to arma 2. just make sure you have a graphics card that will run it well.",68.8
"this is a great game and well worth the money spent. however, since ive been playing from the begining of the alpha, its not quite as fresh as id like. good on its own, but far better with friends, a dedicated server, and some decent co-op missions. the dlc is not worth mentioning, unfortunately.",700.3

"just yes! if you loved arma 2 youre going to love this!",104.4
"arma 3, contrary to popular belief, is a very good game. it really just depends on who you are, or who you play with. if you spend your entire time playing arma 3 hoping to have an experience similar to dayz, you wont have much fun. what you really need to do is join servers that are running gamemodes such as domination, and coordinate with your entire team. keep in mind that arma 3 is nothing like battlefield or call of duty because you have to pay attention to the global picture of the entire map rather than just what you are currently aiming at. you have to talk to your squad, even if it is people you dont even know very well, because everyone contributes to the well being of the squad. all in all, arma 3 is an extremely fun game as long as you play it correctly.",295.8
"i love this game, has great mods to it as well. you will need a good graphics card to play it.",17.1

"10/10 best game for players that love tema work!!!!!!!",692.3
"though not as realistic as its predecessors, arma 3 is still fun and has good replayability with zeus and the mods out there. a big part of this game is multiplayer though, so i wouldnt buy this (except for if its on sale) unless you have that option.",298.5
"one of the best games i have ever played. the realism is outstanding.",61.1
"arma 3 is in some aspects better than arma 2 but worse in other aspects. pros -smoother controls compared to arma 2 -editor is even more versatile now -vehicle handling is now more realistic -flying seems to be improved -you can change your guns attachments on the go -the new uavs are neat -you can change your clothes (aka play dress-up) -ai has been improved cons -the soldiers seem to be too durable now (you can survive a 40mm grenade direct hit or 3-4 shots to the chest from a rifle) -the public server list is full of altis life,dayz and wasteland (and i dont have any friends that play arma 3 so i cant play private matches) -the new futuristic theme is plain boring -a lot of guns appear under fake names -there are not a lot of vehicles",57.0
"its simple there is just nothing quite as rewarding as arma 3 in the video game industry. i mean sure its learning curb is hard to get around but the benifits much outweigh the negatives. great game 9.5 /10 must buy",25.5

"10 -10 full paced action packed real good graphics military simulation deffinatly would recommed for people to play :)",720.4
"this game is very fun and open and alot of things to do. the singleplayer is very amazing with the stunning graphics and visuals. the audio is somewhat clear, but i can understand people clearly in chat and i can hear gunshots and explosions from a long distances and it is very cool. the multiplayer side is amazing and playing from the combat simulation with others to the altis life rpg addon and to the epic zombie survival mod of dayz to surviving and fighting in the world of wasteland. last but not least, the editor for arma 3 is very good, but very advanced to understand right away, just get used to the basic things of editing until you can create large scale battles with the editor. this game is not for the regular fps players, this game is way more intense in my opinion than call of duty or battlefield. you actually have to plan and use tactics to get the job done and the maps are very large and you cant run forever. so at first it might be irritating for new players, but you will get used to it. very fun military simulator and it is very addicting. this game is a thumbs up! :d 12/10",192.8
"this game is overpriced for the content as compared to arma ii and expect to download mods to get the most out of this game. some problems still exist that were present in alpha. expect to pay for dlc (helicopters) that quite honestly i was expecting to be part of the game. with all the issues it is still pretty realistic and fun to play with friends; however i feel guilty having convinced them to buy the game after its initial release.",152.7
"amazing game. very realistic and perfect if youre a fan of the military and military tactics. the game offers limitless gameplay due to the fact that there are so many missions and scenarios created by the community. for some odd reason i get 90 fps on very high in singleplayer, but whenever i play multiplayer, even if nothings going on, it just drops to 30. also keep in mind that this is a huge game. i am fortunate to have built a gaming pc, but if your computer isnt that great, consider upgrading or just dont get this game.",55.7
"this game is fun to play with friends on a server or download the communitys games and try them out. loads of different modes online you can play. but i recommend playing with friends its way more fun to screw around that way",72.5
"supported the game in alpha. didnt even get a discount on dlc which is basically an update. dont support this business model. its a great game if you like milsims, try to find it on sale with the dlc included.",22.9
"arma iii has outstanding visuals and a intense set of game play mechanics. this game is not for the average fps player, its for players who want more from the average fps shooter. all in all it takes awhile to get into but once you find a good community to play with you have a  ton of fun!",22.0
"amazing game, you all need to pick this up if you like realistic combat. harsh for any new player to master but when you get the the feel of the game and master the controls its great fun!",379.4
"don not buy this game unless!!!!! you want to vanish into your computer for hours on end ignoring you wife, friends, and family....... the standalone game is amazing alone and then you have the mods.... altis life is the most fun you can have in rp. you can be anything, cop, criminal, fisherman, dope dealer, anything! they keep making it better and better.",887.5

"i was pilot and my friend was a copilot. gave him the controls because he havent flew in this game ever. he flew 20s and we died. 10/10 would never let him touch choppers again.",360.2
"i played this game in alpha, spawn - airstrike - die - repeat, very unenjoyable. since playing the official release it has been great! i am now able to aim my sights at someone else, pull the trigger and they die, the vehicles are very entertaining aswell. thus making it an enjoyable game now. the campaign or champaign as i like to call it has some delicious variety of cypriut, english and american voice actors who truly went balls deep with their vocal skills. perhaps i should mention what the actual gameplay is like? no, its truly an experience only your hard earned cash can understand, i strongly urge you to consider spending some of your birthday money or stripper money on this simulation (game) and experience the story of a lifetime. you cannot possible fathom the scale of the maps that are at hand, it will litterally take you hours to run from one side to the other in real time. i highly recommend this game if you wish to waste countless hours of your life pretending to be in the military.",74.3
"pretty fun game, i got sick of playing bf4 and other crappy fps games and wanted something different. this game is awesome, even though it runs like a crippled kangaroo on pretty much every pc. the gun mechanics are really interesting, flying helictopters is also a lot of fun. there is so much to do in arma you could play for thousands of hours and probably not get bored. i love doing missions and building loadouts. flying in on helecopters looking at tracer rounds go over is intense. 10/10 would buy again.",144.5
"its a fun game but they need to fix the ing arma 3 altis live. they need to make it so you dont loose all your gear when you die i hate ing spending thousands for gear then a min later i fall off a small lip in the street and its all ing gone...",86.1

"stole someones atv while he looted a body, and then ran on him and killed him. (battle royale) this game is awesome, it has an amazing single player (tough to beat), so much mods to play which is really really fun! like breaking point, wasteland, altis life or battle royale, though there will be bugs/errors, but just google it and solve it, its easy. i would defently recommend to buy this amazing game. 24/7 would play.",21.9

"the greatest military sandbox i have ever played, arma 3 is a lovingly crafted game, giving you an endless amount of scenerios to enjoy. singleplayer gives you the option to screw around with the editor and either create the insane or the epic. its a challenge to learn but well worth it. the main campaign can be frustrating at times, but overall is a very excellent experience. user-made content and scenerios add another layer of depth, and zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer. multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game, giving an in-depth experience in many a situation. you can play it as a roleplayer, joining life servers. you can be a survivor of the wastes in wasteland, or you can join in many user-made situations. the greatest of the options, however, is proper, team-based objective gameplay. with the right men, squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds. it gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team, and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling. if you want a very-well made military simulator, offering wonderful graphics, processor-melting situations, teamwork, tension and combined-warfare operation, arma 3 is for you.",763.8

"if i there was a thumbs up, thumbs down. id give it that, i sunk just about 8 hours into it. dont get me wrong, i quite like this game, the graphics, gameplay, control of the charecters are fantastic. but there are some things id like to go through: 1) ai: this is a major problem which will ruin the game, to kill an enemy, its about 4-5 shots the ai however (even on recruit, can kill you in 1-2 shots from distances at 500m from a standard assault rifle, it ruins the game completely. you cannot complete the game without dying 10+ times. this needs to be fixed, especially on the mission which are on your own. on multiplayer however,(co-op) ai is laggy and derpy at times, and are still op. 2) controls are hard to get used to, they are everywhere, num pad, f keys, behind your back etc. if you cant remember a binding, or get a control wrong, it could cost a mission faliure, there a bit clunky at times. 3) price: 35.99 (i got it for 17.99) in my opinion, a bit overpriced for what you get... but still is a very good game in conclusion, arma 3 is a great game but still needs work with ai overall i will give it 7/10",78.2
"if say you like call of duty, straight into some action, then probably not the game for you, however, forget this games campaign and clunky  controls and go to the multiplayer, give say an invade and annex server a try, trust me, if you are to just follow a group of players, you are bound to have some of the best moments in your gaming life so far.",264.7

"really good game. if youve played arma 2 then this is very similar, if you dont like arma 2 then you wont like this either. pretty much a complete upgrade from arma 2 with graphics ect. its hard to explaine what this game is and if you will like it. i just recommend you go watch a few videos on it.",6.8

"arma 3 is one of the best games i play; with its large maps and units. even after the singleplayer and senarios are finished you can do things such as: the editor, multiplayer or zeus. something to do in arma 3 that i would recomend is to go on a co-op server, such as ahoyworldss invade and annex servers, and play with other people against infantry ai. but even if you find the amount of equipment (e.g. tanks or guns) you can always mod the game. the arma modding comunity is huge, for example if you want to use less modern weapons, you can probably find it, even if you want to scrap the military aspect you can get things such as altislife. therefore i think that this game is a seriously good game and i would recommend it to others.",458.3

"as i love to see games that have the great feeling of realism, this game brings me the most joy. it has some great weapon physics, hit-boxes, ragdoll and all the other types of mechanics. the mods to arma 3 are great like altis life, breaking point, battle royale and others. like i said, this game is really nice if you like simulators of this kind, and if you dont, go back to call of duty ;) <3 ~sadguy",59.2

"after trying for about 5 hours in vain to just get past a small phase in a mission in the game, i can finally say i gave up. above the insanely hardcore combat system, i got killed countless times by mines that i cant understand how to tell their location, so its just a simple, annoying, random death. also the game has a lot of bugs, mainly graphic. id say the devs rushed too much. 5/10 game health, 3/10 gameplay, 8/10 graphics, -30/10 gameplay forgiveness. bought the game when it was 50% off and i regret spending every and each $ for this game which i just cant play.",5.3
"had the game since alpha. didnt really play much of it until my friend also got it. co-op mission is really fun, and since its all about custom mission, so its basically endless. the map is almost perfect, i love it! and the mods are great too. love the game really much. i think ill play it more often after i upgrade my pc though.",58.7
"this game is far too clunky to even be considered a full game in fact this should be in alpha. the controls are ok but the arma engine just makes it feel unnatural like everything is not smooth at all. the spotting system in this game is totall  by the way. you and your friend could be hiding in deep weeds but if an enemy gets within 50mt from you then you appear on their map, ripe for them to then kill you completing invalidating close up stealth. the game also has hit detection problems, i had the iron sights pointed directly at an enemy a bour 75 mt away and i could see the dust of the bullets hitting behind the enemy. overall i wouldnt get this game for full price, possibly 75% off if you want to play with friends because playing with friends does make the game a little better.",117.6

"its arma, no doubt about that, all the previous features you would ever want are there. it is just unfortunate that the issues that plagued arma ii have not even been improved upon, let alone fixed. *edited july 2014* the variety and quality of the mods compared to arma ii is absolute rubbish, but hopefully that changes. the game desperately needs the ace mod too. it is essentially the good old broken as hell game that we all love",87.3
"it is sick, represents real military and you can do coop missions",42.4
"first of all, the single player campaign is a complete and utter waste of disk space. this was a big disappointment to me because i generally hate multiplayer because of cheaters, whiners and knowitalls. fortunately, i let myself persuade to give multiplayer a chance anyway. the first three days i was just running around, getting shot and not scoring a single kill. it was extremely frustrating but deep down i always knew that it was my own fault. then i started figuring out how to move without getting spotted, hold my fire until the right moment and stay alive by aiding my team mates. there are tons of good mission servers out there, find one that suits your style. my favorite is king of the hill team deathmatch. me? im a very patient sniper. ill wait and see what youre up to, move to a good position, get the exact range and send a single projectile your way. other times ill grab a silenced assault rifle and sneak up on your favorite spot in the cover of darkness. either way, youll never know what hit you. some call me a camper. they are called targets :-)",141.5
"greatest military game i have ever played. realistic physics, vehicles, aeroplanes, jets, etc. it is extremely fun to play with friends, especially on custom gamemodes like altis life, epoch, wasteland and others. almost every building is enterable and detailed. the community make this game fun, and never ending. you can always do something new! 10/10",30.2
"great game. the best military simulator out there, even though there arent many servers with domination or missions, only custom gamemodes like altis life and wasteland. it has good performance on medium range laptops (around 800). this game is really worth the money, i have never regret buying this game.",45.7
"i have played the two dlc single player survive and adapt and i found them very interesting and enjoyable to play. the first part survive is more an entry level to arma 3, where you encounter the basic situation of enemy engagement, moving in the wide open territory. hide from enemies. etc. the second part adapt is amazing and brilliant. some missions have intense firefight and they need careful planning, choosing the right position where to engage enemies. is more a guerrilla style of mission, such as the ofp resistance ones. but the gameplay now has really evolved to something reliable, realistic feeling, but also funny to play. i liked it. in the end i suggest to play the dlc campaign to all tactical gamers, who liked ghost recon series, or arma series, or maybe also ofp dragon rising sp campaign. especially arma 3 adapt dlc contains some missions really epic to play! i liked them a lot. cheers !",91.8
"arma 3 is best with a group of people that will show you how to play it. arma can be played by anyone, if your fan of rpg there are game modes for you, if youre a action fast pace pvp player there is a place for you too. but lets not forget that arma is a simulation, no matter what gameplay youll pick, there are limitations made by game which you may not like. overall, its a great game with fantastic community.",487.5
"are you thinking about biuying this ?? keep reading!! i have been playing military simulators since operation flashpoint, and i`m really in love with the arma series and in my honest opinion there is nothing out there better. if you like a more arcadeish experience just get cod, however if you`re into your realism not kids games, get this!! did you like arma 2 ? then this game is that but better, you got rag doll physics and more life like animations, the modify shooting postions is groundbreaking imho and was a massive upgrade compared to previous installments. yes this game has bugs, but the game covers them up beautifully imho.",29.8

"graphics are great. realistic. now i just need all of my friends to buy it!!",17.0
"great game to play especially in multiplayer with friends. the combat system is top notch and the graphics are great if you have a good enough pc to run the game in multilayer. the game has its flaws at times with fps dips on some servers but if you can get past that, the game is amazing. the mods for this game is where it shines for me personally. mainly the wasteland mod and the life mod. on the right servers you will find yourself hundreds of hours of fun easily just by how tense the game can get. my recommendation is to only buy this game if you have a few friends who are willing to play with you. also, if you want to play wasteland only play on sa-matra servers, this way you can reach 60fps quite easily in ultra if your pc is good enough, otherwise you will have to play on the not so optimized regular wasteland servers with low fps (30-40 or less)",275.7
"this game is nothing but amazing.... i dont have a bad word to say about this game... this game is even better when being used to play dayz.... a must have for any arma fan",168.6
"i like this game for its realism and amazing at a militery simulator. the only bad thing about it is the physics........",66.1
"its hard to recommend this game. seeing how they are trying to make a combat sim type of game its not exactly action packed. you spend most of your time equipping yourself, and trying to get to whatever objective your going for. then once you get somewhere you might finally get into some action. now this whole process can be more fun if your in a group & communicating and having laughs along the way. the first few days i played i probably spent about 4 hours getting around and finding stuff and maybe only got into a few gun fights. it takes a special kind of person to really love this kind of game. for me it was more of a novelty. there is one game mode where you need to hold an objecitve, this was more action packed by getting everyone in one area which led to less travel time and more time running around and trying to hunt targets down. once this game can create some modes that streamlines action into the sim portion of it would make the game alot better. all in all the game is amazing, and done well once you get past learning how to do it. you can have a great time with it if you accept how much time your going to spend just trying to get somewhere.",87.5
"i bought this game expecting to have hours of fun... but the game devs thought differently. it has been a week since i got the game and i have not been able to play it because every time i launch it, i get error 81 and it wont launch. this has been happening to alot of people and there is no fix. the game devs are either lazy or just dont care because the problen should be fixed by now. im not reccomending this game untill the problem is fixed.",0.3

"great game! i love it! but that is only because of the mods you can play like dayz. the campaign is just boring and crap! but further top game!",90.0
"verdict: good reasons: on its own the game is a small disapointment from what we would come to expect from bohemia. stating this i would like to mention that the game is not even close to being a bad game the standards where just set very high. the game allows tons of mods about all kinds of things. this game is nothing near cod so you cod fanboys that do nothing else than cod please dont ruin this game for others. overall the anti hack system is prety good. this game requires a lot of team work so dont even think about being a stingy player it wouldnt benifit you. im not the best in reviews but i hope this helped someone",640.6
"one of the best shooters i have played, blows battlefield and cod out of the water.",236.4
"arma 3 is not quite a first person shooter, it really is more of a war simulator overall. it is highly detailed and looks great visually but there can be a bit of a learning curve. the games strong point, in my opinion is the way it tries to do multiplayer, where you make missions and what not. i find this single feature what makes arma stand out the best. more shooters should have the level of control arma 3 gives players. there were a few cons to all of its pros though, so i will list my biggest as follows. 1. multiplayer servers (if not set up properly and efficiently) can make the game squat down and take a huge dump on your fps (frames per second) 2. i feel the multiplayer user interface could use some work. making the game more accessible to new players. 3. better single player. arma may be best for its multiplayer but i think overall more work could be done making the single player experience more enjoyable. all in all i think arma 3 does the shooter/ war simulation best, it may not be as popular as games like cod or battlefield but thats not a bad thing. imagine if it was that popular, then we would be dealing with those guys...",16.3
"just bought it.. already have a good feeling before i even play it..",945.3
"while i love the game, i cant think for the life of me why people think this is the best military simulator out there on the market today. arma 3 just feels like pointing a shooting, but every time i get into a gun fight in arma 2 adrenaline starts pumping through my body in real life. to each his own i guess, its probably because i have played past games. for a newcomer to the series, arma 3 is great. also, i have a gtx 690 and 24 gigs and a very good processor, and the game barely runs at 30 fps. but thats to be expected with a bohemia game, cant really be suprised by that. (edit) i have played 78 hours of this game, just on another computer.",23.5
"arma 3 is a fantastic game and a great followup to arma 2. the game looks amazing, the animations are fluid, and the combat is exhilarating. oh and i saw people complaining about crashing and i can say that out of my 120 hours of gameplay i have crashed once and that was because of unstable mods. i dont even have a beast of a computer and i dont run into any problems. yes there is not as much content as arma 2 but that has to do with the fact that arma 2 had like 10 dlcs. overall its a great game to play whether alone or with friends and i totally recommend it to anyone.",313.1
"this game is like my life. its long, boring, nothing ever happens but i still for some reason cant end it.",244.5

"i really enjoy the multiplayer, especially the rpg servers, but the performance is not that good, for every player, no matter how good the hardware is. but i highly recommend for realistic combat and fun in general!",47.6
"awesome game. great amount of mods and mission types",321.3
"personally i would put this game as m game of the year if not my game of the decade, the fact is even with its flaws, bugs and the perhaps not as optimised as it could be engine...i would still recommend this to anyone who has gotten tired of the average shooter, because this isnt one. arma has alwasy been a miliary simulator and hopefully always will be and this makes the game into something that no other first person game can top. the realism is brilliant and the combat stance mechanic is something fresh offering different ways to take cover, adding new ways to be tactical. not a fan of realism and seriousness? check the workshop and armaholic. you are bound to find something that will have you laughing, crying and having a blast. after all whats not to like about racing go-karts with heavy machine guns mounted ontop? if there was one thing that does bug me its the fact that rocks...tend to eat you sometimes if you get too close so be careful with that tl;dr version: buy the game or i will make a rock swallow you 10/10",392.1
"this game is nothing like arma2, the guns shoot completely different, i dislike the way the character models react to being hit, but other then that i love the game.",227.2
"relatively realistic mil-sim. this iteration is geared more towards gamers than simmers, but its still great fun! note: if you have terrible fps/lag while in a server, make sure you are running the same mods as the server or your game will constantly be running into errors in attempt to locate the same mod files (or so ive gathered). i can run at 30fps at max settings in sp but when i join a server without the same mods i drop to 8fps. dont blame your system or the game!",325.8

"so, this is my review on arma 3, now if your looking for a game with a weak canpaign involving real military tactics but slow gameplay, this is what you get, but, this game is all about the multiplayer and the mods, the mods are out of this world, the only real gamemode i play is battle royal, you bassically get chucked out of a heli onto an island you then have to find a a gun and other things to keep yourself alive, danger every where, random carpet bombings, carepackages, and the other playes, it is a free for all, theres only one surviver, the game does not end till there is only one person alive. overall this game is one of my all time favourite games and i 100% recommened picking this up specially as its on sale, 9/10.",111.6
"amazing game, better with friends. even though bohemia has made the game unfinished so modders can expand on i. its still the best game possable without mods that is the closest ive ever been to being back in a warzone ~a ex-military friend 11/10 would arma again (ive already got 380 hours on this too!)",495.4
"if you have friends its a beautiful game if you dont have friends its beatuful game too.. dont compare this game with bf series or cod series its a war simultator. but its not just about war its kind of life simulator . it have s diffrent modes like altislife......",19.4

"this game is kinda scary because theres night time, and everything is dark. i am really scared of the night but wait! theres also support for realtime lights and night vision so night isnt really a issue anymore. while there are cool lights in this game, it offers a vast array of other features, such as: warfare war weapons war cars war planes war people war simulations war war horse war running realtime marching band i could continue listing other war features for hours on end, but i will stop here. the rest is for you to discover, since that is the essence of this game, discovery and exploration. that and shooting guns.",117.6

"pros: better graphics better controls better sound cons: same laggy multiplayer as arma 2 same terrible interaction system still using outdated arma 2 mod tools (all mods are just ports) most vehicles and weapons are the same between factions, just different textures still uses 2004 netcode its trying to be more casual as of right now, i do not feel as if this game is worth the $60, it still plays like its in alpha. unless they release proper mod tools, i would not buy until it drops atleast 50% in price.",291.7
"one of the best games out there wheter youre into survival modes, deathmatches or role play. theres a mod for everyones needs. would rate 9/10, the only thing that prevents it from being 10/10 is that you will spend a while downloading mods for certain popular gamemodes.",460.8

"this game is great the only thing tere is alot of controls but the graphics are amazing i really like the showcase mode. i play very often i got thegame in december and i love the game now. you should play a bunch of people play it you should to. (the game is like 60 dollars)",7.8

"great game nothign else to say, its really fun to play with friends",273.3
"such a great military simulator you cant turn your head around in a car to look around where are you supposed to go... a z-category shooter but you still have to use controls like if it would be starcraft. i dont play an fps to use my whole keyboard to issue broken commands. dont buy this game. for a strategy game theres only horribly-done strategy elements, and for an fps theres horribly done fps elements in it. for squads and commanders, buy battlefield or any other non-garbage tactical shooter, this game is just bad.",0.3

"its a really nice game if you are into realistic shooters, but somethings i personally dont like is the maps are horrible if you can compare it to chernorous or takistan, and the map is one of the most important things in this game(mp). the last thing thats negative is when you play on 60+ servers, it tends to have an awefoul dsync problem and kills all the fun you could have in the game. otherwise this game is exstreamly good and the stuff i mention is going to fade away over time. sorry about my english typoes.",46.9

"compared to its predecessor arma 2 this game is lacking in all fronts. the animations show less attention to detail, the future-esque models and textures fail to be very inspiring and and there is substantially less content (for example many of the vehicles uses the same weapon models). however, a lot of this could be forgivable if it werent for the truly atrocious optimization. seriously if my $450 radeon hd 7950 from 2012 cant pull above 20 fps on certain multiplier servers their isnt much hope for the average gamer. i am in no way an exception to this, and you should expect to face these issues upon buying the game.",46.7

"i officially declare this game to have one of the 3 worst single player campaigns i have ever experienced in my long gaming career. whyyyy?! why did these guys waste so much time on something that that they are not good at, instead of fixing the existing bugs and adding custom content? arma iii is unique, like a special needs kid whos messed up in the head but can also hack through the most advanced security system. it has a lot of potential but you have to have a monster pc and swim through a lake of cr*p to get to the good parts. disappointed i am very much so far, but i cant not recommend this game, even in its broken state. i am however probably going to revert to arma ii.",247.0
"arma 3 is a very realistic combat simulator. if you are looking for a game with a fast paced shooter and can take a few rounds whilst sprinting this is not the type for you. due to it being a simulator the pace is much slower and you should be much more tactical in your approach. the game looks amazing and the story line has not a heap of jam packed content but the available content is really good. as a simulator is still gives you many of hours of fun! the available units and arsenal are realistic as it gets. this game is not for the faint hearted, it takes some serious gettting used to but it worth every moment, as it states it truly is a simulator. the multiplayer scenarios are also good, many new updates and patches are quick to fix, with pvp wastleland and an rpg angle to the game also available. only thing i have as a con (is from personal choice) is there is no longer any servers playing co-op operations at this time.",129.9
"from the small campaign, to the multiplayer and editor, this game has something for those who mod, those who make maps and those who mess around on altis life. the campaigns are short but sweet, they leave you feeling so great, from the get go, you get to experience the great graphic qualitys that this game has to offer, once you finish a campaign, the next chapter starts where the last ended. in overview, the campaign isnt something that the purchaser of arma is after, its the multiplayer, the multiplayer has the realism of a modern simulator, and the great amounts of gamemodes and servers avalible leaves you with an amazing choice of things to do, from; wasteland, life servers, tdm, anex and invade, conquest, king of the hill, battle royal and so many more. another great thing with the steam community is the mods, with new mods daily your experience can be forever changing. yes sure this game still has some of the buggy gameplay that all the armas had, but you either love arma, or you hate it.",673.6

"quickly became one of my favorites. i didnt like arma ii much, because the infantry gameplay is kinda sucked. but arma iii has seem to pull it all off quite well with the new terrain, weapons and mechanics, while vehicle gameplay are still thoroughly enjoyable. the is definitely a must have for both military-enthusiasts and fps-genre gamers.",194.1
"a solid upgrade from its predecessor (arma 2), the new movement system is outstanding and a really great edition to the game, the new engine really brings the maps to life, espically at night time, more enterable buildings then ever before makes for better gameplay and more care taken when clearing towns/buildings, once the mods that made a2 so great come across and get upgraded this game will be complete, bis add a bipod for christ sake!",302.3
"so, another amazing game from bohemia. arma3 is very beautifull and well made game. from arma2 it got more into simulation part, but lacks some vehicles and weapons variety, but all of that is being add... with purchasable dlc (that sucks, but for this game- worth it).",122.0

"ahhh arma 3 the third expansion of the arma series. i love it and hate it at the same time at different moments. the increased modding capabilities really made me really interested. the main thing that really disappointed me was the lack of variety in the weapons and vehicle department. they werent really unique but the gear system helped add more variety to the cosmetics of the characters but, that doesnt really help due to the fact the weapons dont have much variety. i love the arma 3 campaign, not as personal and deep as the arma 2 campaign but still fun. there are still soo many bugs that need fixing and optimization for multiplayer fps wise is very bad at the moment too. i still give this game a 7/10 since it has many abilities from arma 2 and is still fun. expect a lot of bugs though and a few random fps drops but, that doesnt really effect the gameplay as much.",94.6
"imagine a game that was completed by the developers. who routinely worked to upkeep, maintain and fix any lingering issues. this is not that game. 2 years in the making and it feels just like dayz alpha. incomplete, bug filled and constant dlcs that you can buy but dont expect anything to be fixed or working in any of it. waste of money and time.",86.3
"your team is moving in a complex and strategic formation into enemy territory to neutralize hostile troops&infantry and seize the area. as a vulnerable and mortal soldier, you really feel how teamwork and cooperation is the essential key to survival and success. call in airstrikes, mobilize the approach. people yelling and screaming commands, explosions and gunfire. this game has the best movement mechanics and combat mechanics i have ever experienced. the single-player story is good so far, and the multiplayer coop gameplay is absolutely amazingly astonishingly beautifully magnificent! watching realistic movies like black hawk down and the hurt locker really makes me want to play some more arma3. aside from that, the new map is so incredibly beautiful that i enjoy every single moment spent on it. i can just drive across the map without any action at all without being bored because of the challenging terrain and vehicle-movement, and watching the beautiful landscape.",313.8

"this game is great. this game get alot of critisizm over the lack of content, and i dont think thats justified. the lack of vehicles and whatnot is just a redirection of effort into animations, phyics, customizable loadouts, attachments for weapons, improved ai, smoother controls, a much larger map, and of course, how pretty the game is. if people whine about the lack of weapons, you can just point out just how many weapon attachment combonations there are and so forth. bohemia is a great company that cares about its fan base, and they try to get as much content out there as they can. some people talk about how expensive the new dlc that just came out is, when i reality, you get most of the content from it for free, the $15 is more of a donation then anything else. whenever bohemia add a feature into the game that the fan cry out for, the fan immediately start to whine about somthing else, most recently, bipods and such. another thing that the fan whine over is poor optimization of the game. the game runs fine, and if it doesnt, you could always tone down the graphic options a tad, it wont hurt the gameplay. tl;dr its a good game and it really doesnt deserve the critisizm it gets.",701.5

"summary: tensions rise as nato peacekeeping forces begin to leave the republic of altis: a strategic fault-line between crumbling european influence and a powerful, resurgent east. but when a key radar facility drops off the grid, a mediterranean flashpoint risks escalating into global conflict. also gameplay: the engine is a big step up over arma 2. things like the adjustable stances, dynamic fog, physics and underwater terrain add tons of possibilities in the game. setting: this is one of my major problems with the game. sci-fi and simulation dont mix well. while i know that everything in the game is possible, the fact remains that most vehicles and weapons are pure speculation. the equipment not being used in present day armed forces partly kills the immersion for me. hopefully ace mod will fix this. sp content: the campaign (so far) is awesome. bi managed to improve the storytelling and the gameplay as well as the realism. mp: performance in mp can be horrible, depending on the gametype and server. i dont often find populated servers with interesting gametypes, as there only seem to be 2 popular gametypes on public servers. collapse",88.0

"this game is addictive. yet it has tons of bugs, its fun. if you are concerned that you wont like it, try watching some altis life videos on youtube, and buy the game when it is on summer or christmas sale on steam. now, lets get to what really matters. there are two sides to this game. there are the rp servers, and then there are the milsims. the rp (roleplay) servers are easy to get, it deals with altis and turns your gaming experience into a life, which then you have to develop your character and become friends (or enemies) with others. you can mug, kidnap, and  (if youre experienced) other people. this gamemode is for if you want to have some laughs, and a  ton of fun. if you are wanting the military simulator part of this gamemode, then go check the millitary simulation servers. there are fewer of them, but they can be still be fun. this gamemode provides a damn good simulation of war on altis. ranging from hardcore strategies to commanding your troops, this gamemode emits a real life enviroment for you to practice your gaming skills in. thats all, hope it helped!

"i do reccomend this game, as far as military sims go there is none finer. the mod support is wonderfull essentially turning one game into several possabilities.( altis life, breaking point, epoch, and the regular wasteland) not to mention the hundreds upon hundreds of single player mods. the graphics are stunning when compared to arma 2 as the improvemts to the ui and over all controll of character and game elements make it much smoother than its predicessor. on the negative side are bohemias ugly dlc content. the karts are cool and for the now price of 1.99$ sure why not. however the newest installment of arma3 choppers is a cash grab ripoff, allow me to explain. this dlc offers 2 choppers that were already in game, that just couldnt be piloted. essentially they added a little scripting tweak to allow players to use them some other supportive bells and whistles to go along with them and stuck it with a 16$ price tag....i cringe to see what the upcoming marksman dlc offers compared to the price. buy the game, well worth the money...however i would hold off on purchasing dlc untill the price drops, which it will inevitably do.",281.4
"pros: -sick graphics -sick physics -sick control capabilities -awesome dialogue between npcs and player -alot of realism in the camp setups and mission stories -multiplayer is alot of fun if you have 20+ friends cons: -enemies that can magically see you in full camo while u prone behind bushes at 3-400 meters distance with no zoomed sights or binoculars -appearance of a difficult campaign based on designed circumstances requiring you to corpse run your way through it or be chuck norris and one man army groups of 30 enemies at a time at 300 meters with nothing but an unsighted crap rifle and no ammo -fatigue system that forces you to walk slowly and stop to rest while your npc partners can sprint 1000 meters in front of you and get killed, leaving you to once again chuck norris your way through missions. -over 100 silly keybinds that are not even good as far as default keybinds go and will require at least an hour configuring them so you can use about 20 of them. (changing from a laptop to a desktop requires you to reconfigure all of them again) -multiplayer requires 20+ friends i recommend this game if you want to hate a game while spending hours afk in a bush because despite what the story requires your character is not chuck norris and you cant do anything.",45.9
"i`ve been playing this game for over a month and i`m pleased with it.if you want to buy it i strongly encourage you to buy it if you have a friends that bought the game.this game is made for multiplayer.you can play the campaign and workshop missions.i`ve been playing 3 modes:altis life,wastleland and battle royal.i enjoy them and i don`t get bored by them.i play with my friends with amplifies the experience. pros: a alot of mods to choose from enjoyable if you have friends..... you don`t get bored easily/ cons:you need a good pc to run this game on 30-60 fps i don`t really liek the singleplayer missions(personal opinnion.) it`s kinda expensive.",117.4

"great game, i wont say this is the best game but the best thing of the game is modification. even though the sound is bad, not that much vehicles and the functions is not enough, still you could use mods like jsrs, vehicles addons and scripts to increase your gaming experience. single-player gameplay isnt the best but multiplayer is the main point of the game. play around with friends or even build your own clan, it has great features to enrich the multiplayer game experience. every game has great points but also bad points, it does on arma 3 too. for much modifications and these beautiful graphic, 32bits game engine is clearly not enough. its sad that even you have a well built computer, it still have a  fps and much lags. biohemia has said that 64bit game engine will be avilable someday later, hope it does happen before arma 4 release. game rate: 7/10 (minecraft: 9.5/10)",513.0

"i did not enjoy arma ii. it was buggy and didnt run well and the gameplay was very clunky. but arma iii improved so much over arma ii. although there is the steep learning curve, once you wrap your head around it, it can be very fun. movement is much better now, interface has improved but could still use a bit of work and the graphics are gorgeous and the game runs nicely. one of the things that this game has over tradional fps games is intensity. gun fights are intense, you can feel bullets fly past you and if you miss a shot, it can cost your your life.",67.6

"one steam review for this game was as follows: cod = kids battlefield = big boiiz arma = men if, like that reviewer, you feel that your manhood is at stake, you might be willing to convince yourselves (and vociferously attempt to convince others) that this game is great. the tedious gameplay would be tolerable if not for the truly awful ui. maybe it makes you a man to want a game in which you crawl through grass for 20 minutes before being shot by a sniper from 1km away, so you can start the mission over. or maybe its the experience of trying to navigate poorly designed context menus when someone is getting ready to shoot you in the face, or being set back an hour of gameplay because of an invisible toggle that was on the wrong setting. this is a game for people with egos that need stroking, who think bad interface is the same as challenging gameplay, and dealing with it makes you manly. and i suppose that is a lot of men. but not this one.",4.4

"this games interface is horrible it is not intuitive or natural by any means. would have loved it if the interface was more like battle field 4. also the game feels very choppy and i am not referring to frame rate. i guess you either love this or hate it do not think this is anything like any other shooter game. i am sure the game will appeal to fans of the previous releases but at this stage i feel like i wasted my money",11.6

"i like shooter games, and i always saw my brother playing them and they looked very fun. when i was old enough, i got call of duty and had a blast. i kind of expected that kind of fun from this game, but i was dissapointed. even on beginner difficulty the soldiers take 30 minutes to kill, and you take 2 shots to the foot and you are dead whereas you can shoot them in the chest five times and they ill crouch and order their whole squad to fire on you with their unrealistically impeckable accuracy. if you like pulling out your hair and the feeling of overwhelming rage, this is the game for you. if not, you are wasting your money.",7.2

"takes some practice to be good at this, and a lot more practice to work tactically as a team, but nothing is more rewarding than moving fluidly as a unit and getting things done without losing a single teammate. once you get the tactics down you will then be able to fully enjoy this game. 8/10",32.2
"singleplayer: + smart a.i + can be hard + lots of missions and scenarios - story is not anything special or interesting multiplayer: + lots of servers + lots of players - server browser is slow -some servers need extra add ons to play -sometimes no servers come up in browser - can be laggy community: +can be helpful to new players + mods improve the game - alot of trolls - lots of hackers/ scripters gameplay: + can change attachments & clothes during a fight to help + driving is fun +/- controls for just about everything - very demanding game for hardware - can be buggy - guns sound the same - not enough guns (without mods) -cars flip too easily overall: 8.5/10 best if you play arma 3 with mods, vanilla game can get boring.",131.4

"i officially declare this game to have one of the 3 worst single player campaigns i have ever experienced in my long gaming career. whyyyy?! why did these guys waste so much time on something that that they are not good at, instead of fixing the existing bugs and adding custom content? arma iii is unique, like a special needs kid whos messed up in the head but can also hack through the most advanced security system. it has a lot of potential but you have to have a monster pc and swim through a lake of cr*p to get to the good parts. disappointed i am very much so far, but i cant not recommend this game, even in its broken state. i am however probably going to revert to arma ii.",247.0

"this is the most realistic war game in existence at the moment. do not buy this game if you enjoy call of duty or other similar shooting galleries. this game is hardcore with its precise controls, realistic damage model, and complicated battles. the singleplayer campaign is something to be marveled. it blends realistic war with an intriguing story. this game is for those who want more from the everyday shooter. you must be dedicated if you want to play this game. i will easily reccomend this game but only if you know what you are getting into.",25.8
"waited a long time before i decided to get this game but have to say now i have got into it im glad i did. the content is a bit thin but there is lots of great stuff on steamworks and the internet. if your looking for a realistic combat game this is it recommended.",31.6

"great game, hate that the dlc comes up in my game, i would buy for the right price, purchased carts, maybe if helicopers was priced around $5.00 that would be exceptable, since at this time i dont have it, i would like to see the dlc ads in my game gone, mods and dlc are great dont get me wrong, just no need for it in game.",270.6

"i must say this is simply the best shooter out there with so many user created contents like sandbox environment, persistent player stats apart from the normal pvp and co-op game mode. arma 3 is much more optimised than the prior version. best immersive gaming experience like you felt when first time played ops flashpoint: cold war crisis.",55.9
"continuing a fine tradition arma iii brings realism in combat to the greatest level. maps that are miles across with dynamic weather and day/night cycles (you can even navigate by the stars!), the best ballistics in the shooter gaming world, and every type of vehicle you can think of from tanks and helicopters to jet aircraft and small submarines, plus a powerful mission editor and decent ai gives you an unparalleled amount of content and replayability for your hard earned dollars!",807.5

"immediately upon entering a rp server, i was asked to enter a strange vehicle (held at gunpoint of course). i hopped into the back of a black pick up truck and an invisible force prevented me from leaving. i was then driven halfway across the island. it was a long trip, the strange man in the front seat told me a few stories, some very touching others not as much. by the end of the journey, i felt much closer to the not-so-strange-anymore man. our brief 15 minutes together had me believing i had found a new friend. a companion in this bleak world. that belief was soon torn apart as the man in the front seat let out a guttural scream and drove us both into a lake. your experience in arma 3 could be similar. 10/10",23.1
"the next generation arma awed reviewers with promising graphics and an intense single player campaign. what seemed like a would be goty quickly has faded away. as people slowly, possibly dreadfully make the switch to arma 3 they will see it is a myriad of misfortune. with very little solid content to speak of compared to its predecessor it has left people in want. the game has been an overall disappointment for me, with a lowered sense of viable large scale combat, and very little aircraft to be talked of i was sorely disappointed at bohemia interactives next generation game in the arma series. the only thing that has made it playable is the limitless community made mods to add things that the developers seemingly forgot from arma 2. this causes me to not recommend this game.",226.6
"this is arma 3. the game we have been waiting for forever to improve our arma experience for along time coming. the game does add lots of cool new features to arma but the vanilla version of arma 3 lacks content. if you are planning to mod it and play with a group of people then i highly recommend arma for you, but in the long run without mods this game lacks content. 7/10",434.7
"amazing. so much to do. so much content. whoever likes sim-style games/the arma series. this is (after some patching and content adding by the devs ;) ) definitely a must have! edit: too bad they add all these (expansive) addons, but now after the game and campaigns are finished its for me like an amazing sandbox/sim/fps game, that only the kerbal space program can reach in terms of replayability. very well done bohemia.",80.3
"i do recommend. what is needed for the game is fair enough of a free time. especially have on mind, that setting up a good multiplayer experience is a matter of many hours. animation were greatly improved and ai as well. only negativum for me is not using all the game very promising mechanic in the sp part of the game and very weird ending (all options) which was done under a rush i believe. if youve grown up on flashpoint, this is a must have",45.7
"i really only play breaking point mod. but this game is amazing! even on the lowest graphic settings this game is beautiful! unlike arma ii(2) the inventory management is super easy to use! if you like dayz then youll love breaking point! so much more to offer!",71.4
"this a very good game great graphics gamelay and everything the only bad thing is the price.",21.7
"personally love the arma series, 3 started off good but has since got unplayable for me after each update. gone from 60fps to sometimes under 30 regardless of server or game type. nothing has changed at my end, so given up for now. edit: ok, on my new pc this gaming is truely awesome. just one of those games that needs a nearly insane amount of hardware to run best",180.1
"better combat than arma 2. now are the guns better? yeh, attachments make them better. do they handle better? well, id argue that the damage system and how bullets flyed was better in arma 2, and that people move too fast when jogging in arma 3. but then again, people still play battle royal and koth in arma 3 so yeah, arma 3 is better.",114.2
"arma 3 is perfect !!! my only complain is about the game is not 100% optimized i still drop frames altho i have i7 4790 oc and 970 gtx oc 4 gb , i hope they will optimize it soon as we know there wont be arma 4 soon",139.8
"quite possibly the best fps experience out there, multiplayer wise, story i wasnt to fond of. for me there isnt a game that comes close to the real deal  as this one does. very very fun. cod and even battlefield players be warned this game isnt a run and gun in multiplayer, it requires teamwork so long as your teammates are not shooting you in the head just to steal your startup cash, it is a very communication teamwork based. yes you can go it alone but your chances of being surviving and objective or mission in multiplayer dwindle without someone making sure your not gonna get sniped as you go in assuming you dont get killed by the npcs at that objective. i like how you have to set your range on most medium to long ranged rifle scopes and damn near all vehicle guns/cannons etc. im telling you now i cant explain this game all in one review just buy it theres nothing more to say other than your crazy if you dont. it is a bit demanding for hardware but if you have nvidia card 660ti or above and have the geforce experince and let it optimize the game for you i find that i can get 45-55 fps. correct me if im wrong others in the community but im pretty sure this game will support 4k.",1009.2
"arma 3 is a top game, i highly recommend this to anyone who likes tactical fpss. the graphics, and gameplay are awesome, plus theres a whole lot more, like the editor where the only limitations is your imagination. play in other peoples creations what they have published on steam workshop. play through the newly added campaigns in single player. multiplay, coop, single play is up to you.",182.4
"this is one of the best military simulations i have ever played. the campaign is not bad, but you can download scenario missions which are user created missions. theyre incredibly easy to down load; you simply browse for a new scenario, subscribe to it, and you can play. its also easy to remove if youve completed it. this game has a huge replay value and youll never get bored. great job arma 3 devs!",197.7
"such a great military simulator you cant turn your head around in a car to look around where are you supposed to go... a z-category shooter but you still have to use controls like if it would be starcraft. i dont play an fps to use my whole keyboard to issue broken commands. dont buy this game. for a strategy game theres only horribly-done strategy elements, and for an fps theres horribly done fps elements in it. for squads and commanders, buy battlefield or any other non-garbage tactical shooter, this game is just bad.",0.3

"a very hard but rewarding game. not like cod where you run and gun,you must play the game carefully and strategically. also this game is very realistic. this includes: bullet drop,fatigue,heavy weapon sway,penetration,and so much more. this game is truly the king of war simulators.",564.6

"hmm, i dont wanna say this but your dlc so f***ing expensive. 14 dollar for 2 helicopters? are you f***ing serious? i cant use mini gun in helicopter cause dont have dlc, what the f*** is this? but gameplay not so bad. i got a sniper i see bipod when ill use it. buy dlc marksman are you f***ing serious? i bought it 59.99 dollar. ill buy this helicopters? 14 dollar? its in your dream bohemia.",43.5
"7/10 single player is fine. mods can make sp a fun experience. but once you try mp, thats a solid no unless you play wasteland or on a private server. the fps on any server running a custom game mode is terrible. it is higly unlikely you will get above 30 fps on a public server. i cant speak for private servers but if you want to play mp, play wasteland or find a group that has their own not-bad private server. only recommended because of sp",92.2

"i cant even find the right words to emphasise how huge this game is. i hate myself for not buying it when it was $32, and i definitely didnt want to miss it at $45. even for the full price ($60) this is a great purchase. yes, it is that good.",49.2
"great game! but the problem is that it is too expensive. make it cost less and peoples will have more fun playing it with there friends, because right now arma 3 is forgotten cuz of day z. this game is without doubt the greatest war-sim ever, but yet it is way too expensive.",18.1
"the most realistic military experience short of being dropped into a live warzone just got more intense with the go kart addon.",65.6
"arma 3 is really fun and there`s lots of different ame modes to play. there`s really super tactical military simulation servers, then there`s things like altis life where you have your own life on the island. the free updates are really good and the dlc is really worth it for what you get. it`s a bit hard to get used to but it does get easier if you practice. 9/10, really good game but a bit confusing for beginners.",77.6

"arma 3 is possibly one of the best military simulation games i have ever experienced. pros: - wide variety of gamemodes - friendly and (mostly) mature communities - multiplayer allows some crazy fun times with as many friends as you can get together - performance is quite good for most instances (see cons for exceptions) cons: - performance in big cities with a lot of players suffers heavily - physics can be a bit derpy in some instances, and result in death - desync! do some research on it, however it is an arma thing - your social life will slowly fade away when you play this game overall: i would easily recommend this game to sandbox/shooter game lovers.",245.6
"i played it sometime... just a little... its great i guess... to be more precise the game is an awesome game for you and your friends. theres alot of servers just for you.. if its a zombie game your looking for? join epoch or some other mod about zombies. if its a realistic team playing server? go ahead join one of the great communities out there if you just want to kick some  online? join king of the hill and the game is even moddable theres 100s of possibilities theres alot of opportunities i reccomend this game for the guys who likes the realistic, team play and maybe guys who like competetive",739.6
"best game i have played so far. everything is so realistic that immerses you in the game that some times i think i am in real combat. i totally recommend it. 9/10 just because of the weird controls.",7.0
"bought this game for the breaking point (dayz) mod,but i decided to give epoch and altis life a try.it was a blast i had a great time playing with friends,so i tought i should play the campaign,im sorry to say that it was horrible,the ai was dumb as f*ck even at the hightest level of difficulty,and sometimes game would crash at the end of a cutscene(although this might be an issue on my end).so overall i think that arma 3 is a great choice for those who want to play online,if you are looking for a good singleplayer campaign you might wanna avoid arma 3.",123.3

"everything you wanted a combat based shooter-sim to be. fly a helicopter and do strafing runs? sure. lead your squad to do breaching parties? why the hell not? scuba dive with friends and clear our enemy positions? very fun. this is probably the best shooter i have played. and i am looking forward to the full development of it. arma 3, you have my respect also, iits visually stunning, and its either 3rd person and 1st. 10/10",97.2
"great game. it starts of boring at first (well for me as i havent played arma 1 or 2) but then you get used to it and you start meeting people and coming up with tactical plans to take out an enemy base. you begin to build your own squad with your friends. there are differet game modes such as altis life where you can choose to be a cop, rebel or a civillian. you can then start a gang with your friends and start making drugs (create your own empire like heisenburg). you can basically do anything. arma 3 is such an amazing game and you will have problems with it at first but you will grasp it. you will always find something new to do with your friends. all in all i would give this game 10/10. great tactical play with realism and really throws you into the action. this is nothing like the  call of duty franchise or any other shooter this is unique.",23.6

"so i cant join hardly any servers. i can join some wasteland and altis life but when i try joining battleroyale it will not let me join. i have the arma 3 kart dlc. most servers also have a yellow question mark on them, not sure what it means. i bought arma for the multiplayer. really upset it costed $60 and i cant even enjoy the best part about the game. the campaign only lasted a couple hours. the ai will sometimes insant headshot you from across the entire island randomly, ruining the experience of the game. commanding your squad is so frustrating at times too. alot of things in this game are just not worth the money. very dissapointed. if you know how to fix the server issue please reply!",15.2
"a beautifully crafted open-world sandbox military game. whether you want to play life or you want to play as a soldier, this game has endless possibilities. the free dlc is worth waiting for too. as a longtime gamer, this game brings something new to the table, and after arma 2, it still feels fresh. i give this game a 10/10 as it has no drawbacks and the capabilities are endless.",5.3
"recently changed the game to a thumbs up. very steep learning curve, mostly because of the clunky interface. graphics are great, especially the night ops with thermals and night vision goggles. head to head multiplayer is still a lag fest but the co-op mode works fine. the various modded servers that are not arma 3 confuse new players who want to jump into the game to only figure out they are actually not playing the designed game. pros : great graphics, nighttime play, large scale battles, combined arms forces cons : steep learning curve, fictional weapons and vehicles (why?) , no rally point system that makes constant helicopter rides (5-10 min) per unrevived death.",41.7

"so far i like the game, i am not a cod fan but own many of there games, because imho cod was the best fps out till battlefield bad company 2 came out, then bf3 and now bf4 which are by far my favorite fps games. but arma series has allways had my attn. because of its mods and add ons! it truly looks as if they put allot of work into arma3 as it looks great and runs very smooth on even a cheap gaming rig where as the older games were a bit hard to run even on good hardware! i do think anyone that likes fpsers and willing to put in more than just run and gun should get this newest release, but keep in mind this is more like a simulation game than any other fps out there so most wont like it off the batt! i am running it on a older amd cpu phenom ii 970be quad core overclocked a bit and a gtx 680 classified and with some playing around got avg. fps to about 30 which is great in the arma series. i really love the story line so far and cant wait to see how far they take this game!",54.8
"im not going to pay this money for this game - totally not, you shouldnt. 1st you should get a better gpu, and i mean a very good gpu, arma 3 still needs better optimization. 2nd wait for multiplayer fixes, it still has some desync insues here and there, multiplayer performance needs improvement. 3rd why do i need ot wait for multiplayer fixes when i can play singleplayer? - well arma is made for coop action, and by this i mean join a clan/ group/ unit that knows how to play the game correctly. 4th buy it and you will see it will be worth it!",653.4
"arma 3 is a very fun, open world game. it has an extremely large modding community, and is widely played by those throughout the world. it contains a scenario editor in which you can create your own missions for you and/or others to play together. it has a unique scripting lanuage, which is difficult to learn at the beginning, but is very flexible once you learn it. the community has much variation, from player age, experience, heritage, etc. and is a great game for those who really like combat/strategy.",336.3

"arma is the only place today where you can get a realistic military sandbox. there are bugs, glitches, animations, and vocals that are inherently arma, but that is not always a bad thing. sometimes the armaness can be quite entertaining. b.i. has, and had always stuck by their products with full support from updates, patches, and dlc. mods...thats a whole new world. there is fun that can be had in this game that you cant get anywhere else. yes, its hardcore and your fingers do the arma tango on the keyboard but its well worth the getting used to.",185.0

"cant tell you if you should buy it or not, but i can tell you this. you will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have. but when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, its something magical you just cant find in any other game. arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. you buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. arma is a game which you can never called finished. there will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! ill give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back. read: i will not accept random friend requests! if you have a question, please post it in the comments.",919.3

"this game can offer you a lot of new experience and probably teach you some patience aswell. yet i cant tell if you have to buy it or not, you must decide what you want and does this game have it. apart from that it offers you a lot of sp missions - campaign and player made missions aswell as mp which is incredibly awesome. thumbs up for their project and good luck in development of this. for players who dont have it - well .. you must know that there are bugs and issues in game, but that is not ruining gameplay in any way. (at least i havent come up on such). if you have bought it, dont be shy and explore what it offers, this game is not meant to be bought and after failed mp (get killed) or sp (killed again) thrown out. believe me it have much to offer! :)",81.9

"ya its a great game if you enjoy using the editor. new features with the ability to change stances is very cool. graphics are much improved from arma ii, but this game is not playable on multiplayer. some might say you must have a high spec processor and graphics card, but then why can i play single player with 60 fps on ultra.(i have fx-4170 4.2ghz cpu, r9-270 gpu) multiplayer matches have only the ability to deliver 20 fps which is just unplayable. then people say you must find a good server, but nearly every server is this way, unless i play a small 4 man coop mission which isnt even the selling point of this game. i thought this game was meant to be played on huge multiplayer missions on huge maps but it hasnt gone that way and hasnt been that way since the alpha.",128.4
"this game is legit and amazing. the devs try not to call it a sim but its as close as you can get while still being a game. its very realistic with damage and weight models. body armor and helmets give a degree of protection. the same applies to the variation of vehicles in the game. the 2 maps are huge and there are plans for dlc in the future which will no doubt add on to that. speaking of addons the giant mod community for the game is always hard at work making new missions, weapons, and vehicles to add into the game free of charge. there is endless replayablility with this game and if youre a shooter/military game fan then this should be in your library. honestly, if the game was more optimised (insane cpu usage for projectile physics and ai decision making) i wouldnt even play half of the other shooters that are out today because arma does it all and more. pick this game up!",509.6

"pretty fun though i only really play the wasteland mod.",303.3
"a really fun game that is a great improvement compared to arma 2 when it comes to combat and animations as well as the variety of gamemodes. however, the game is a little unfinished or requires a little more refurbishment when it comes to general points such as audio and factions (combat audio such as firefight sounds including distancing of gunshot sounds is disapointing). however, overall, the game is a deffinate must buy and some improvements can be made with few simple mods easy to download.",657.5
"better than battlefield 4 and every other fps combined times 2",27.8
"arma is one of those few games dedicated to a niche market. with arma 3 the team has made the game more accessible for newcomers to the series whilst still maintaining the steep learning curve associated with the series. the lovely new graphical fidelity and the improved animations combined with a dedicated and growing community (with its awesome custom made content) make this a hefty game to invest in...but with limitless replayability and intense amounts of co-op fun.",179.3

"arma iii is the latest installment in the franchise and one of the best military simulation games you will ever find in the gaming maket. ive been playing arma since the first operation flashpoint was released in 2001 so when i played arma iii, i felt right at home with its familar ui, controls, and of course the map editor. the map editor will have to be my favorite feature throughout the arma series. you have tons of options to create your own missions so for example, you want to take out a base in the darkness in lone wolf - done! you want to launch a direct armored assault towards an fortified enemy position - done! the options is endless and it doesnt stop there. the arma modding community is what brings more life into the arma franchise. there are tons of limitless mods that enhances the immersion and gaming experience even more. theres also a list of cool gamemodes that changes the gameplay drastically for multiplayer, but to be honest, ive never played any of them, which is quite shameful considering ive been playing the game for the longest time. i have yet played the campaign, but i can tell you that arma iii is the ultimate military simulation. you can say goodbye to call of duty and battlefield. i highly recommend this great game.",266.9
"walk-simulator...but if you have a couple of friends for coop it is fun i loved the old operation flashpoints games. you could save when you want, now with arma iii you cant, that makes replaying missions so annyoing, walking everytime like 5 minutes, again and again... also the peformence is terrible, you have to make the game very ugly to play it fluent on modern systems. please go back to your roots developer! about the multiplayer i cant say much, people banning you for no reason, but i like the coop if you find nice peoeple. on the good side, the controls improved very much, but i dont get the point of people saying it is a simulation if you cant even release your bipod...even in the arcade game battlefield 3/4 you can release your bipod... also the enemies can see through plants/threes and on. on sale you can have fun with it, but i would not buy this for a full price.",1.3

"like all armas this is a sim not a fps. pros; sim with lots of mods cons; the mods are really the game. its solo mode is really bad, even compared to other armas very glitchy, very glitchy the price is twice what it should be. dlc price is twice what it should be. you need to have a tv and cable. when playing any of the mods you will spend hours running long distances in real time. so hulu is a must. overall; once its under $25s with dlc it will be worth the cash. but att it is way over priced. and when playing, be prepared to deal with a lot of haters until you find a good server with players who fit your style. dont give up, it can be alot of fun.",52.7
"not only is it one of the most beautiful settings in all of video games, it is the most accurate military simulator avalible, always great fun with large parties of friends, but you also meet great people by playing in game, recommend you get teamspeak for this game, and research some great mods, becuase it is a large community modded game which makes it even more fun. also watch some how tos before you play so youre not totally blind sided, also know this is not call of duty, the game involves tactics and survival instinct to play, you will get destroyed if you one man army in this game. only down side is you do need something relitivly powerful to run the game so look at your specs. otherwise great game.",45.4
"no other game is like arma. nothing will ever be like arma. you need this game.",645.1
"this is a great strategical military sandbox game its such a cool but  dont like the mod types like survive so we also need a zombie sandbox gamemod like dayz epoch,we dont even have a mod like that that game is great for the altis life players so the only great thing of this game is altis life its the best rp mod  have ever seen so ppllzzz, bohemia interactive add thing like dayz standalone or just add a expansion like the arma 2 operation arrowhead.",125.3

"highly recommended! as no big fan of any fps genre, i found this release impressively beautiful, complex, and truly a representation of military simulation game were long to. my fascination to the series began when bi, together with cm in the old days released operation flashpoint, then the next release such as cold war crisis, the first armed assault up til the third installment. gamers with high preference of immersion and reality would actually addicted to this beta-state game; which will be developed more as the community demands more realistic, more challenging battleground. i recommend you buy it now, before its development completes and eventually released in full-version. cheers :)",82.5

"i dont get the ultimate military simulation that this game advertises due to bad servers and confusing attachments. is this a bad thing? no. instead i got a hunger games style experiance with battleroyale and tried other mods such as atlis life and breaking point which i found to be entertaining to watch but not fun to play.so yes, basicly the only reason i baught arma3 is for battleroyale. is that a bad thing? no. i find battleroyale exstremely fun and there is always the opportunity to play new mods in the future. you might get this ultimate military simulation experiance but most do not. just something to keep in mind. note: alot of mods are external from the game and even steam workshop. for example to play battleroyale you have to download the withsix-play mod launcher to be able to connect to the battleroyale servers. its fairly straight forward so you shouldt have to worry to much.",48.9

"i realy like this game, iv been wanting a game like this for a while, its like the audio from dayz but beter and the graphics are on ultra and run perfect on my computer my favourites modes would be roleplaying in the arma 3 life its fun when your a cop mostly i like being an innocent and then smuggle guns throughout the world anyways 10/10 happy to have gotten this game for 39.99 aud it was only 29.99usd now its 59.99usd but anyways its still totaly worth it",18.1
"first of all, arma is not a shooter like cod or bf. the pace, style of gameplay, maps, are really different, but i have to say that it is more enjoyable, funny, and communicating with the other players is great. for example, being the gunner of a tank: there are numbers that tell you direction and distance, so other player inside the tank tells you the indications to shoot. you wont be able to find this anywhere else. or being in a squad, splitting in pairs to clear some buildings while the other 2 players cover you. it is important to make clear that you buy arma for its multiplayer and coop mode. if you are looking for campaign game, dont buy this. also, if you are planning to buy this game, i have to tell you that you will have to join a clan to enjoy this game to its maximum; otherwise, by yourself, you wont like it as much :s joining a clan means you will have to download mods (content created by the community), and probably teamspeak (program similar to skype) to play with them (all clans ask for a mic, take that into account). to sum it up, arma is a total unique in the experience out in the market regarding fps. nonetheless, to have a good time you need to join a clan and play with other people, and be willing to download new content.",237.6

"i recommend this game because it has roleplayinggame [rpg] and i was joining a fantastic group of friends, made a lot of people who are now my friends.. also when you purchase this game, make sure you get the go-kart dlc, its fun and fantastic. when you join a rpg server, beware of there admins because due to the fact i was randomly killed then got randomly sent to troll island for actually trolling for picking up my things isnt consider trolling as im pretty still new to the game myself. there are 3 type of roles in rpg ; apd [atlis police department] ems [emergency medic service] and civil [civilian / rebel] - i mostly play on apd but after got blacklisted from that, i usually play rebel nowadays. but yeah this game is for men only not little wannabe kids / boys that play battlefield. most of this game features are actually true as in for me, idk bout you guys. recommend to purchase this game! -teamspeak official [tso darklord]",759.4

"honestly, this is the first arma game i have played. just getting back into pc gaming over the last two years!! this game is easily the best shooter/mil sim ever made. obviously if you know about arma there are some things that suck and are coded weirdly...that said this game was done damn near pefect, the story is one of the harders storys ive ever played, being a veteran myself you really do have to throw down tactics and watch flnaks. the online is where this game shines, from an intense filled game of king of the hill, where 3 teams fight for control of neutral objectives, with helis landing on wherever they feel for a drop off to the airborne op side in getting a flank for a building or side of the town set up. altis life is an amazing rpg style game, from police force, to gangs, to being a drug dealer, dirty cop, medic, farmer and try to live in the virtual cities. rules will vary by server on that mod. dayz sa pissing you off like it did to many of us...once you have arma3 you can play breaking point!! the best zombie survival game on the market!! class systems, vehicles, tons of weapons... if you dont arma bro you are pcing wrong!!",798.2

"pros - freedom - customization - visive impact - mods & addons cons - still some bug - need optimization would i reccomend this game? hell a lot, hell a lot. this game is hard, requires time and sometimes you need to pass over little problems, but it rocks. a lot of extra-free-content, a lot of mods that change game characteristics, addons, mod for sound, mod for graphics, mod for ai, new maps, new a lot of stuff. really cool simulation. unluckly i cant play this online because i didnt have time, but there is a lot of sp missions and you can create also your own. big community behind. 8.510 reccomend!",98.6

"loved it! its a nice, opened world, and great graphic game. bohemia has yet again, blew my mind. when arma 2 came, i didnt like it due to lack of graphics and its complaintcy with the loot system, but they have helped it with arma 3. i cant wait till the people who made dayz start an arma 3 version of it :3. for anyone who wants to play it, its fun with friends, and by yourself, so have a whack at it and see what happens xd.",36.5

"overall, the game is pretty good. i myself can say that i am somewhat pleased with it, the map is huge and very fun to explore its just with a 200 square kilometer map you would have more then just 14 air vehicles, maybe more planes and helicopter. they did mention they will be releasing new dlc for the game thank god i bought this when it was in alpha. otherwise i wouldnt be buying all that dlc. bohemia in my opinion needs to step up their game and realise there is more to please then just the general european public. :)",764.0
"buy it! seriously if you already havnt do it now!",209.2
"so realistic that i die in one shot 11/10 would buy again",114.1
"the game arma 3 is a superb sandbox military simulator. it has a campaign that showcases the game its self then it has individual showcases for elements inside the sandbox. it has an included editor for creating mission and mp missions. mods are very welcome element to this community. i have played altis life on the asylum server. this modification is a gta type atmosphere with lots to do. it has cops, civ, medic roles. housiong perm gangs and the like. i suppose i should mention some of the bad. the game can give frustration from time to time with hacking and game crashes. as unfortunate as it is it does exist. i had to spend a couple of days figuring out stop working errors. the game does get regular updates which help as well. also if you have a subpar rig this game can put some stress on your hardware. i get anywhere beteen 34-63 fps but some will have talked of worse fps thatn this. overall i reccomend this game just based on what is trying to be done here. this is a huge undertaking and very few games have the scope of this game with the and open sandbox experince.",339.0

"as an army game its lacking, as a game with untold potential its fantastic. this isnt just an army game. when you buy this game you buy a sandbox with unlimited user created content along with endless possibilities. in my opinion this game is worth the money. i havent even scratched the surface of this game and im already hooked.",5.3
"its hard on noobs. it was for me. but as soon as i found out the basics i had so much fun!",18.9
"i wish i had the money to buy this game :( its so fun!",2.0
"armas popularity stems from the fact that its a modern shooter with good modding support. thats it. the game itself is heavily flawed and buggy. bohemia interactives strategy is to exploit the lack of moddable shooters by releasing a half- game and letting the modding community fix it. sure, there will be some great mods for the game but their success shouldnt be attributed to arma. games like battlefield 1942, battlefield 2, and the half-life series were hugely popular due to all the great mods made for them. but the games themselves, without mods, were actually competent. with the shift to catering towards console gamers, modding support has fell by the wayside, and arma, perhaps unintentionally, fills that gap. but arma has horrible ai, horrible physics, horrible performance, a clunky ui, and so on. if arma werent moddable, im confident its metacritic rating would be more like 5/10.",17.4

"i hate the dlc system. you buy a game and can only enjoy a part of the content. i pay money for a complete game not for parts of a game. almost wish that pirating will be popular again, so game developers need to deliver great stuff to get the buyers back. with that said, its still a good game, but it could have been great!",262.9

"i play arma 3 since alpha, it has changed alot since first builds all in plus. its currently best game to buy if you think about tactical fps game, and also it isnt just that you buy arma and its all you get. arma 3 like arma 2 is a platform that allows modders to create completly different game modes that developers originally designed, also the game has a lot of devs attention. dlc-s like zeus make this game even more interesting and avilible even for non scripting gamer society. only thing i wish to see in future arma 3 development is more dlc (no matter if free or not if it bring lots of new stuff) and directx12 witch will help to improve performance.",328.6

"in an over view, i do reccomend this game. i bought this the day it was released for alpha, and i knew the gameplay was going to be rough. since then, it has broadly improved, but i still see some lacking areas. i mainly notice this in the aviation area. (i like jets, pretty sure im the only one) without any mods, there is only one jet available, for cas, and aas (correct me if im wrong if its not called that) and one uav. i find this rather disapointing, as there is no lack of jets in arma2, and all of its addons. i just think some more jets should be added, that do not require the download of mods. (some people do not know how to apply them) but overall, i like this game, and reccomend it to anyone (arma veterans or not) who is looking for a good game to put time into.",75.2

"after so many hours of playing this game, i can now truly say that this game is worth it. there are many many reasons into why this game is worth it, my first reason would be the workshop scenerios and edit missions, you can make your own missions to your hearts desire, the game is quite easy to edit on maps and now with the world maker, we are soon to find new maps in the coming years, second reason is the multiplayer... yes right now its still young and so was arma ii was young multiplayer was awful but in a year or two there will be more networking optimization in which online gaming will be the main core of arma iii. thats all i want to say, i can go into so much more details on realism and how i always come back to this game when i dont want to play fast shooting games. arma iii while still new and adding more and more stuff which includes the workshop will become one of the best games by bi and i am glad to say that this is a full on recommended game. please support bi, 60 dollars is nothing for this game especially when workshop is free, p.s : you buy bf4 for 60 and add the crazy dlc and no mod support at all when you pay 60 for arma 3 and you get full mod support and some dlc of your choice, but because of mod support with workshop arma 3 is the best choice when spending 40-60$",535.3
"a technical marvel, arma 3 is an example of the pcs prowess for games touting large worlds and realistic environments. the lightning model, physics, and impressive character models are all incredible. the gameplay itself has improved since the original arma game in its third iteration, but still has a bit of growing up to do; in order to compete with the battlefield and call of dutys of the world (let alone even the operation flashpoint games now being developed by codemasters) - when it comes to the actual first person shooting mechanics. there isnt enough umph or feedback when firing the weapons in the game, and its still very hard to land any meaningful damage, making for some unsatisfying gameplay while first person shooting....in a first person shooter game (whilst aiming down optic sights, positioning your soldier avatar, taking into account range, and adjusting for bullet drop). the title is in need of more content as of now (more coop missions), and still a lot of tweaks yet to be done with the actual gameplay (namely bad buddy ai, and sharpshooter enemy ai), before arma 3 can be easily recommended to operation flashpoint fans.",4.0

"for what this game tries to be (which is a war simulator) it fails misserably at that. the movement is clunky, the a.i is dumb and overpowered as hell. so if you get into this game being all like yeah, this is what war is like, this is realistic and really precise then sorry. you need to get out in the real world pall. because i dont consider a game that when you shoot the enemy in the head they are able to do a 180 turn and shoot you 3 times in the head before dying very realistic. same goes for boosting of stairs when walking down from them to quickly and breaking your legs. this game is however one of the funniest games i have ever played with friends. the amount of vehicles, the guns, the destructible enviorment. the overall map is not to shabby either. if you get this game for fun gags with friends and just cause overall chaos then this game is perfect for that. if you get it to play it as a serious war game then id say the clunky motions and faulty a.i ruins that emediatly",12.3
"game had great introduction and i had fun. i dont know what it says about a war game when the most enjoyable part was the driving bits though... there was also quite lot of lag and frame rate kept jumping. i also had problems with achievements so that they did not come up when i got them, they came hours late or not at all. game had problems but i still recommend it because it was fun.",23.0

"arma 3 is an excellent game for any hardcore realism shooter player, and is still a good game for casual shooter players. through its a great game, the one thing which sold me on arma is the freedom you get. when i play any other shooter, i am frequently dissappointed by some of the features in movement, weapons, and vehicles. for example, i may be playing red orchestra, a slightly less hardcore fps, and am trying to work some cover, but its either slightly higher or slightly lower than the crouch and standing positions. in arma, i could use the stance system to barely peek just my head and gun above cover to fire. or, i might be playing planetside 2 and somebody is hiding behind a wall. in arma, i could shoot through the wall, use smoke to cover my approach, lob a grenade behind it, call for fire support, air support, or my squadmates. its these choices and freedoms which raise the bar in every other shooter ive played and have consistently brought me back to arma, despite the clunky-ish and complex controls. 9/10 - would reccomend to a friend.",214.4

"arma 3 and the rest of the arma series is best enjoyed with either a good organized and not so serious group or friends. since this game lives by its user created content there is an editor included that lets you create you own missions. let those be small or large, easy or tough, you are the creator. not to forget the steadily growing amount of user created mods. this game is a simulator (sometimes for walking long distances), so do not expect any arcadey gameplay, you get shot, you may live and treat your wounds or you may die instantly. tactical thinking is the key here and running head on is mostly the wrong thing to do.",506.4

"the best massively open world first and third person shooter i have every played. arma 3 makes call of duty advanced warfare and battle field 4 look likes child play. the amount of detail in all there helicopters, tanks, troop transports, characters, weapons, maps, lighting, effects, go-carts is overwhelming! sometimes when im flying over a city getting ready to para-drop into a hell fire of tanks and jets, i feel like im watching a hd action movie of the year! i dont what i love most about this game the most, might be laying in the grass on a hill a mile away from any conflict staring down my scope of my rifle calculating the wind and the bullet drop, then taking the shot. no game has every made me feel so rewarded when i complete a mission. amra 3 missions are not these 5 minute deathmatches there long fought out high action battles. also there map is so big its insane, and its not just one island, theres others that are insanely big, i cant even imagine how long it would take to go from one side of the main island to the other flying in a helicopter going over 200+ miles per hour. lastly very unique complex non-repetitive terrain. love it, care for it, buy it!",281.9
"some say arma iii is too hardcore, some claim it to be #1 bug simulator, but nevertheless its the most well-made, most realistic warfare simulator. 1. controls there is little difference between the controlls of arma ii and its precessor. however, some changes were made, like controlling your characters position with ctrl.+w/s. it is often mentioned that the game is too hard to play due to its controls, but what else can be done? its a simulator, not an ordinary fps. 2. graphics the visual part of arma iii is also state-of-the-art. various effects like pip (picture in picture), shadows regulation, textures quality will leave you pleased. 3. difficulty level the difficulty is the thing that scares most newbies. its not like cod/bf/moh!, they shout. and they are right. yes, its hader than most fps, but after a week or two you will be playing it like a pro! conclusion arma iii may not be action-driven, it may have some bugs, but its the most realistic war experience youll ever get without the need of going to the army.",9.1

"i like it and most of the times playing life mods. there are so many mods which you can play the will be always one fitting your needs and wishes. my favorite is rp life mods and i can still enjoy playing them. it has several single player missions which can help to get used to the game. as well there are several military mods, life mods, fun mods out there. i recommend this game.",303.0
"absolute fantastic game. very good simulation and good physics. big open maps for dramatic scenery.",197.2
"i highly reccomend this game, it is very intense, and extremley imersing, it takes a high level of skill to play in any multiplayer game, wether it be a wasteland server, or a capture the island server. the ai are higly inteligent, and if put on a high level, nearly impossible to beat, the game is very well put together, and i recommend this for pretty hardcore gamers, because it isnt a casual play through game, but it is well worth the time you invest in it, belive me.",281.5
"its super fun to play with friends and is very interesting.",34.1
"nothing is better for any military type game. this is very configurable and highly recommended by any player who has played it. give it time and you will be hooked and stuck to it. make sure you have a high end pc. game comes with plenty graphics and high use of cpu. enjoy it and join for something that will be put in history of game servers!",447.4
"this game beats all other shooters. although there are some things i wish this game had or didnt have, it still keeps me in suspense and excitement. i recommend this to anyone likes more realistic and serious, yet exciting games. right now, this is by far, my favorite game.",701.0
"the best war sim to date. not just pick up and play, but that is rarely the case with any deep simulation game. arma 3 is crafted by developers that care for the game and the community and you will not find a better military sandbox game to play in.",164.5

"great military simulator, which will make you play for many hours with all the stuff do. the game looks really good for the huge map, and if you have friends to play with the games fun factor completely changes. you can plan operation and do them with your friends and you will feel like you are actually in the army. (but then you realize you sitting on your chair yelling at your friends through the mic.) everyone should get this game, not just because it is great fun, because it shows true teamwork and co-ordination. hope this helped with your decision :)",426.7
"i stoped playing other games like battlefield,cod ect after i started playing arma 3 best game real war game , what i really dont like in this game low fps on most of the servers more then 40 players on very high setting. its drop my fps even if u have very powerfull pc.... u wont able to get more then 25 to 30 fps on very high settings on multiplay server more then 4o player my system spics are processor i5 4670 (cooler master seidon 120 v) graphics gtx 660 4gb ram 500 gb 750watts power supply. i hope bohemia interactive will sort out this issue ...",799.1
"amazing game, mus buy if into military simulations or the arma series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",131.9
"you know that a game is a hard core military sim when you spend much of your time marching and griping to the co about how the chopper could have put us closer. yes it is hard core, but, with the right scenario, surprisingly accessible. game still seems in development without clear instructions on how to create scenarios and seems a little buggy, but whether that is due to bad scripting or the program itself is unclear. id pick this game up if cheap or if you know a group of people who are keen to play and have at least one person who knows how to mod and run the server. there are also plenty of arma clans out there to join if you are keen. again the game still doesnt quit feel as complete as the previous in the series but then the game is trying to do a lot and once you get in, you can still have a lot of fun.",299.2
"the game is great, its very glitchy and needs to fix bugs but overall is one of my favorite games.",212.2
"ive been a fan of this series since operation flashpoint. arma3 is simply an incredible experience, visually stunning with environmental and visual features thats yaw dropping, gameplay that allows you to setup and experience an amazingly wide range of scenarios. i highly recommend getting into this fantastic gaming experience. this is one of the best investments i have ever made, getting more than 450 hours + gameplay. also, the modding community are very active and passionate, so the replayability is guarenteed.",508.4
"great shooter simulator! singleplayer might be boring for some people, but the online experience with a great community will give you a great time.",553.0
"epic game such good fun especially if you have played previous arma games",95.9
"having followed this franchise since its original appearance as operation flashpoint back in the late 90s it struck me as game to follow, and for good reason. it wasnt a game about running in guns blazing (although youre welcome to give that a go), it was a simulation of what war is like, where one minute you could be running through a field with your squad to hold the town and then the next you get clipped by a bullet from got knows where because you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. if you want a game that is a corridor shooter, with arcade reflexes and regenerating health, then this isnt the game for you. if you like a challenge, like realism and immersion then deffinately give this a go. on another plus side, the devs are always updating this franchise with patches and has one of the best modding communities out there. if the devs havet done it yet, then the modding community more than likely has.",59.9
"very fun to play, my favorite game modes are altis life, king of the hill, and wasteland. overall great game.",450.3
"this game is horribly unoptimized, very buggy, and just plain doesnt work sometimes. most mp servers are garbage and lag like hell, the single player campain isnt very good, and the vanilla game isnt worth anything near 60$. think of arma 3 as a foundation for things to be built on top of. this game gets so much better with mods and other addons. this game is without a doubt the best military simulator out right now, and it gets many times better if you play with a group of people. it has pretty much infinite replayability and more things to do than youll ever be able to. it just has so much to offer and experience. ive found that playing with a group of people in arma 3 is an amazing experience that no other shooter can offer. arma 3 really is the ultimate sandbox in which the possibilites are endless. if you can overlook its flaws and get over them, youll find arma 3 to be one of the best games youve ever played.",123.0

"badly optimized game. its insane that you cant get 60fps on even the lowest settings during multiplayer. it will make you motion sick.",21.0
"great realism and lots of co-op action available for the most fun experience. though the engine is poor so you cant really get more the 50 fps. but i tend to pull through it and have fun!",931.1
"the best game out of the arma series so far! i have played around 106 hours of arma 3 so far so you could say im a beginner. i was not a big fan of arma 2 but this one is phenomenal. graphics are amazing. this game will give you with an adrenaline rush every time you play! worth every penny. if you dont have it buy it now!",818.7
"do not buy this game this game is amazing, it is fun and multiplayer can be a real challenge. but dont buy this game because it will crash on every update and there is no fix for it do not give your money to this company honestly, how hard is it to patch a game to fix these crash bugs, fresh install doesnt fix it, restarting computer doesnt fix it, hell.. even installing it on a brand new computer i have which has never seen steam until before, yep, still didnt fix this f-ing game best game, worst support.",337.6
"this is like a drug. murder simulation, the sound is probably the best thing about this game. the first time you fire a simple 6.5mm round you realize this game is on a completely different level from anything else. some games can be more fun, but none are more real. sometimes youll have memories of killing people on certain maps and youll wake up in the morning and remember it, that place you went to and that person you killed. genuinely a feeling of disconnection will grow when you play other games because you dont feel like they properly exteriorize a sense of realism compared to arma 3. the sunlight is like video game wizardry ill never understand. closing this review ill say you should have confidence in yourself, play the multiplayer from the start, switch your rate of fire, run and kill kill kill.",511.1

"i thoroughly enjoy arma 3. yes, its a fps but primarily its a military simluation game. its very accurate in that regard. the controls can sometimes be a bit wonky, but 3 is a vast improvement over 2 as far as layout and keyboard customization capability. ultimately, the games good trumps over the games bad in my opinion and experiences, and though it could benefit greatly from some polish, its still much better than cod or those style of games for me.",612.0
"ive just started playing arma 3, and ive just played out the whole bootcamp, so i now know the basics. i think that its a extremely fun game, even though i havent tried out the multiplayer yet, but from what ive seen from gameplays i think it will be great! for those who want totry some real combat secenarios outside the bootcamp (beggnienrs) i would really recommend scuba, which was a exremely fun gaming experience. note thogh that i havent played all the showcases yet.",10.6
"this is a great game, the developer (bohemia interactive) clearly know what they want to do with themselves and their games. their content is all very high quality, everything from the world, to models, to texture, to most mechanics are all very well fleshed out and realized. for a simulator, this game is astounding, and engaging. imesrion ranges from cod to crying over the death of a squadmate. however! if you cannot quickly find yourself a group or squad to play with, this game will quickly become a bore. my only disapointment is their stubbornnes to not fix the action menu. feel free to watch dslyecxis video for more information. 9/10 if you can find your niche, and if you dont mind the action menu. please do not pick up this game however if you are not a fan of military simulators. are you a cod/battlefield/cs:go fanboy who doesnt appreciate other styles of shooters? this may not be for you.",196.2

"better than cod. may strain your computer, your memory (realizm demands many keyboard shortcuts), and your eyesight (is that a rock or is that a sniper trying to line up a shot at my head?). longer multiplayer matches than battlefield (lets retake the entire island with our 30 man team against an actual army). fantastic steam workshop content in the form of car races, single- and multi-player campaigns, and shooting ranges. 9/10.",39.3
"dont get me wrong its an ok game but there is some stuff thats bad about it. first of all the ai. the ai once just circled around in a helicopter without even reaching the waypoint. they also repeat everything they say. lastly the realism. i know many of you dont care but its not as realistic as arma 2. in arma 2 you could kill someone with one shot but not in this one. it took me like 10 with a rifle. i do not recomend this game unless there is a huge update. lastly i forgot the physics",233.3
"great game, really gets you addicted, worth the money(check out , for cheaper price). still a bit buggy, and need some tweaks. but nothing major. youll need a good computer, but with the recent multiplayer updates, im getting better fps at this then arma 2.",259.6
"the new features are nice and makes the expiriance better but the game still feel`s like arma2 for example walking aroun still feals like if you are not shure if you whant to move(not fluid). the vehicule physics are still way bad, still feels like a millitary light transport is made out of glass and you also still fall trough staires. whit the really over price dlc that does not fix anything and makes you pay for 2 heli and a arma 2 mod that was better when it was a mod, i recomend this game but only durring the glorius steam sells",107.3
"arma 3. one of the games that is just so hard to review because of the many different ways you can go about it. lets just say, i recommend it if you like 30 fps even with a mid to high end pcs. very heavy on cpu and not very well optimised, but its arma. what you get is huge maps. love it.",293.2

"arma is such a strange game in some ways. theres always two sides, and not in the enemy and ally way ;) on one side it offers an almost unique experince (certainly in the previous series) of playing a game seriously, with as close to real as can be, perhaps too much so. but it does highten tension when youre all fighting together and if you make a mistake youre out. on the other hand the game itself sometimes feels clunky and the controls seem like they have purposly been made difficult. not that this is differnt from previous arma, it just continues to annoy me. any game that does not have e as use might as well not use wsad as directional keys. every action seems like hard work, almost like a battle, and while ive had fun with arma 3, it sometimes leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth, of time wasted. even with this, i struggle not to recommend it, its a good game, theres loads of game modes and if you can handle the control setup then youll certainly have some fun! plus its a step away from cod/battlefield, which sometimes can be a welcome change on its own.",69.7
"fantastic game 9/10. visuals are amazing on any setting above medium. style of gameplay is completely up to you. replayability is infinite. audio is brilliant. the only downfall is the ai (if you have no mods on), the settings for their skill levels needs a bit of refining. its either theyre as dumb as a stump or so smart that they drop you before you can even get ready. definitely recommend.",468.4
"incredible game made by currently unpresidented developers, supporting probably the best online community ever. there isnt enough superlatives to describe the astoshining feat made by releasing this sandbox, at least not without sounding like a rant. frankly, take any favorite fps or military game. then add sandbox, quality, free dlcs and continuos improvements, scripting possibilties, all vehicles and weapons and maps readily avaiable from the first try, no need to rank up and no need to pay to win. i could go on much further, but the best source for factual information is of course [dslyecxi] his youtube channel:",79.2

"a bit choppy and a little too complicated. the game overall is quite smartly laid out though, as each soldier in a squad will need some particular specialty in order to maintain the squads threshold against an opisition. after spending hours of entertainment in this game, watching the pretty graphics and npcs at work, i can say that the game is definately worth plating... at what cost though?...",5.8
"really fun to play with friends, 10/10 from me on how realistic the shooting is.",179.1
"this is arma 3, not call of duty. you need to practice communication, strategy, situational awareness, as well as being able to listen!!!!! listening is above all else the most important. unlike fail of duty, you need to help the squad you are in when in multiplayer mode; not who can have the biggest electronic  and showing they are on the top of the list. all this shows is that you are a gloryhog and a piss poor player, but mostly an , that will have you excluded from future multiplayer games. also unlike fail of duty the calibre of rifles plays key as well as environment conditions, like bullet drop and wind. if you play call of duty, this game is not for you! go play with the other prepubescent inbreds, or socially/maturity  adults, to compare imaginary  with and see who is the biggest  of all. if you do like tactics and strategy, then this game is for you. again, if youre a call of duty player, look forward to the next craptacular expansion of that horrible series.",53.6

"singleplayer is an exercise in pain on high difficulty. game overwrites autosaves and limits you to 1 save. prepare your body for an autosave with grenade launcher rounds inbound forcing you to restart. great roguelikelike.",70.3
"great fps/simulator, not for cod style fans. -pros very immersive gfx with the mods/game types it always keeps the game fresh bullet physics are accurate excluding windage -cons sometimes (depending on the server/mod) you can have a very buggy gui overall this game is awesome if you like a more strategical fps (though it allows you to use 3rd person). due to the multitude of servers that run different game types you will find it hard to put this game down. if you like to rp then there is altis life which allows you to take up an persona and do task associated with a job that you choose. these types of servers are policed by a selected police force. if you are after some team work you can either choose a co-op mission which allows players to take on objectives enforced by a very intelligent ai. this being said there are servers that offer a pvp experience whether you want an objective base like king of the hill or deathmatch style. this game has what most gamers that enjoy fpss and even those who may not!",272.1
"awesome game , big improvment from arma 2, much better graphics, runs better even on my dated machine,better guns , better maps ,feels smoother ,great mods for it. altis life: lots of played interaction (not allways dm). do all manner of stuff to get money.be a drug runner, a bandit holding people up, delivery missions, farm materials, rob banks and federal reserve,be a car theif . spend on guns, cars, choppers, various licenses,become a rebal with access to naughty illigal fire power and cars, most fun iv had playing this mod has been trolling police , getting into car chases , shooting them in the face and taking their stuff or just generaly pissing them off, not played as a cop yet apart from steeling their cars and pretending to be one .. wasteland: its like battlefield on a massive scale and more in depth. farm for your guns ,cars and supplies, team up or not , make bases. can be really fast paced like battlefield or on larger maps you may need to go find the action. but it now , i heard they gunna run out of copies soon ><",327.9
"arma 3 is a wonderful platform for military simulation. where the game truly shines is with the extensive modding community. you will do yourself a disservice if you do not check out any of the multitudes of mods for this title. the game itself with out the mods is a great improvement over prvious titles like arma 2 for example. personally i used to be big on the battlefield series but once i started playing arma it was arma or nothing for my modern day first person shooter. the depth and scope that you can get into here with the combined arms focus is truly amazing. everything fromt he graphics, to physics to sound effects are really good. oh and if you dont want to use the vanilla stuff, again theres mods, even full conversions that bring all the assests from previous games into this one. theres also a really fun multiplayer mode called zues, which is essentially dungeons and dragons meets first person modern day shooter. one player acts like the dm and the others play in his / her world. allowing you to create dynamic ever changing and unique situations on the fly. this one gets my whole hearted thumbs up. for information on how to mod your game, check out this youtube video:",828.3
"despite the performance issues, i have to admit, i love the game. its the best military simulator available. i recommend that you have an extemely beefy pc. also, check this link. it will help with the performance.",86.4
"massive maps, the biggest ever created and every soldier got their own part to play in the war, some are medics, some are snipers, some are tank drivers etc etc.. and wow are there some freaking epic battles in this game ! ! ! massive maps massive firefights amazing graphics & physics so much teamplay is needed for this realistic war game! 10/10",9.2
"the graphics are amazing and weapons not to bad.. i have to recommend if you want a combat simulator go ahead. if you like battlefield/cod you will not most likely enjoy it to much...",2.7
"one of the most astonishingly open-ended games i have ever played. the sheer scope, diversity and flexibility of content packed in this game is completely and utterly mindblowing. this game and its predecessors stand and laugh at all those other games calling themselves realistic, and shows them how to get it done. twitch reflexes dont win here, player cunning and coordination does.",292.5
"arma 3 is an amazing military sim, with lots of different gamemodes so the game never gets boring. very fun to join up with your friends, recomend sandbox mode, altis life, and king of the hill. i heard battleroyal is really fun but never got to play it yet, if your looking for an intense shooter i recomend purchasing this game even at the 60$ price point!!!",175.6
"great game overall with a great modding community!",86.0
"great military sim. this does not play out like a run-and-gun game like bf4. this is a tactical shooter and you have to take movement slow and methodical. ai is extremely efficient at killing you, so you cant go in guns-blazing. it has about 5 different character classes to choose from, as well as rarely used vehicles. each class has their own abilites and weaponry. i would not recommend this game to anyone except those who have a high end cpu and video card because this games graphics and netcode are very poorly optimized, causing even the best computers to run at low fps. i have an i7-4790k overclock 4.4ghz cpu, 16 gig ram, and gtx780s in sli and i get from 30-50 fps in multiplayer. most ppl get below 30.",251.3

"my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game, ever. were on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. im leading a team of 4 men. we come to a crossroad and i sprint across, telling my men to hold back. i cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. nothing. i run, my saw gunner runs, my medic runs. but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across. anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through? remember the sniper scene? the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down. he then takes two more in the chest. the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. he screams as hes being shot. crawling, drenched in his own blood. sarge? you aint leaving me out here like this, right? i-i wanna go with you guys! cmon sarge, h-help me! cmon! please dont leave me! he died after that. i cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.",206.5
"this game, strangely(?) isent just for the serious gamer. if you do know arma 3, you know im on about the editor. :p the editor i say is just there for those who rlly arent serious and want to enjoy the game anyway. you can make the most funny sceaniros sometimes, like a go-kart road trip :p or a submarine tour. for both serious or not serious gamers. :d get it.",12.2
"as a huge fan of arma 2, i really wanted to like this game. i knew it would have a rocky release, but its been over a year now, and this game still feels incomplete. of course its poorly optimized, has sli issues (my pip wont even work with sli), and is very cpu-intensive, but thats only the beginning of my frustration with this game. issues from arma 2, like the horrid vehicle physics, are still prevalent in this game as far as i can tell from having my apc rolled over by a pickup truck. the fatigue and weapon sway debate aside, this game still clearly has problems and is hardly a finished product *ahem $16 dlc that includes just 2 helicopters*. at this point, ive just given up on bis, and dont see them fixing this game any time soon. that being said, i have had enjoyable moments with this game, but just not enough to compensate for the amount of technical issues the game has. tl;dr: would not recommend to a fan of previous arma games, or anyone for that matter.",215.4

"from the outside looking in arma iii imitates the best and worst aspects of postmodern war. the vast majority of your time in this game will be frustration from shear amount of bordom, that is until a firefight breaks out & its the most intense game youve ever played. the juxtaposition between these two emotions is not unlike every headcam video of a soldier at war that are all over the internet, so if that at all interests you, id say buy arma iii.",35.7
"get this optimized , holy f**ck is it bad. you can have i7 and gtx 770 and wont do it !! horrible in that aspect ...... needs like 4 titans sli with 100 gig ram and so on...",178.7

"havnt even played vanilla arma 3 but the mod scene is great. would recommend to anyone.",244.4
"fun, even in alpha this game looks amazing and feels good to play, ive had a few issues getting stuck but a restart fixed it, the preformance issues i suffered with arma ii no longer apply and the game runs perfectly on maxed settings (minus dof because i personally dislike it)",3.5

"there is nowhere to start with this game. i started a editor level and flew around the cities. i nerdgasmd when i saw the water in this game. bohemia have done a beautiful job designing and making this game. my computer isnt the best one to play it on though - but i still managed to fit in a worthy amount of the campaign and multiplayer options. the maps in arma 3, ( atlis and stratis) are very large and have been completely mastered. from guns to drones, i adore this game. thank you for bringing us a masterpeice, bohemia.",3.2
"this could be a great game but is way too demanding....my pc beats the minimum requirements and still runs laggy no matter the setting even on the lowest settings its still bad,,,,,dont buy unless you have a high performance pc or it will be a waste of money. keep in mind what ive described above was on solo/single player, online is much worse even if its a dedicated server. dont click the buy button you have been warned",637.5

"arma 3 takes it a step further with then its predecessor with enhanced ai, gripping storyline and immersive campaign. the campaign is split into 3 parts, each released seperately. this keeps you on hold slightly but its worth the wait. also the multiplayer with the use of mcc sandbox is great fun.",558.2
"good game but seems to crash a lot! i have a high spec laptop and computer, the issue seems to be mainly with multiplayer :(",217.0

"this game is great. not only does it have a great campaign and editor, it offers multiplayer. it is 10x better playing online with friends. and if you ever do get bored with the vanilla game there are mods. a lot of them too. you can also download so many different mods. there are downloads for missions, guns, cars, and a whole lot more. there are also different game modes and scenarios that change how you play the game. this is by far one of my favorite games. so i truly do recommend this game!",386.1
"i really cant recommend this game in the state that its in. bare bones content. nowhere near the value for money or content that arma2:oa alone has. stupid, awkward release schedule and lifeless world and content. i wish i could get a refund.",55.3

"i find this to be one of the better open world games that i have played in a long time but the driving in this game is a little tricking but i do recomend it to others as it is a really fun gamr to get and if you get the ccg launchers it makes it even more fun as this then brings in the construction of building and also the few zombies that i have come accross make the game a little more challanging but all in all awsome game have fun boys and girls",7.7

"if you like arma 2, you will probably like arma 3 too. graphics are great (if you have pc good enough). gameplay is as it should be for arma - tactical. i think this is the one of the most realistic war games out there. there is also a preety nice community - you can play community created king of the hill, wasteland, other missions. dont forget to grab a microphone because working with team is so much fun and is actually what this game is about - tactical teamplay. in short: if you like war simulators with great graphics, teamplay and nice community i would recommend you this game.",14.5

"i think it is a bit over priced but it still is very fun. my favorate thing is the editor because you can spawn in anything you like and mess around with everything! altis life is a really cool mod for arma 3 aswell so you should try that out if you get arma 3.",138.6

"its a great game if you can overlook the bugs and the desync... i would recomend hopping into a atlis life server then go and make some in game money and make some new friends and have fun! its a really realistic game but ill have to give it 8.27/10 only because its buggy :( but if you overlook the bugs its 9.75/10 on my books!",179.7

"the most realistic shooting ive ever played. definately not an easygoing fast-paced shooter, its complicated and hard and takes time to master. the singleplayer mode is good, but dont expect a really special story and unforgettable characters. it think its plain and straitforward: you do your missions and try to stay alive while you get to enjoy some gorgeous graphics. and then theres the multiplayer mode, where most of the fun is at. the maps are great, the scenarios and objectives vary and you can stay entertained for quite some time if you end up liking the game. but its not for the fair hearted. being reckless will cost you. one shot can and will kill you so you have to think and act fast and outsmart the enemy. winning really feels like winning and losing feels like an opportunity to try harder next time. if youre looking for something fast that hands out easy rewards, you should probably get some other game as youre almost certainly going to hate this one. but if you like shooting games turned up to eleven and youre up for a challenge, youll probably enjoy arma.",2.4

"not recommended yet. as of jan/2014 bugs still exist in the game and the single-player campaign isnt finished. i bought it because i found it at 50% off and arma ii oa multi-player servers were fewer and fewer, except for day-z, but thats not my thing. what i dont like the most about arma iii is the small amount of content available (without mods) and its futuristic stance. its a matter of personal preference but i like to see vehicles and weapons that one can find in todays battlefields. and i really miss the taliban! graphics are quite good but performance in the game is a mixed experience, it can be ok for most of the game but then you get near an explosion and the whole thing slows to a crawl. my advice is: wait. even at 50% off. edit: after launch arma has been getting better and with some good and free updates. despite still missing some old content, im changing my recommendation to a buy discounted.",94.8
"the game itself is remarkable. arma2 + much better graphics. the mechanics require some getting used to, but the gameplay is fun and very realistic. excellent combat simulator. if you are not used to combat sims, there is a steep learning curve, but it is much easier to learn than in arma 2. the action and movement mechanics are much more fluid. once you get bored of singleplayer there is multiplayer involving co-op (team up with others to complete objectives), wasteland (join one of 2 factions, or go at it alone on island, surviving and killing others), and a plethora of scenarios and mods to play with. most of my gametime is currently on the breaking point mod. the mod gives an unique experience than just normal multiplayer. you will have to use tatics and strategy to survive from zombies, nature, and other hostile players. i had this game since alpha release and it is a must get if you loved arma ii and dayz. if you want a realistic, tatical shooter, this is it. no call of duty, counter-strike, battlefield  here. beware you will need (cpu) processing power to run this game. gpu power not so much.",542.5

"a game in which almost always when you die it is the games fault. broken  piece of  in which you have to scroll through menus to do  which is very convenient when in the middle of a firefight, almost revolutionary id say. a simulator where the cars explode(!) when you crash it into anything. this is a game made by devs who have never played any modern games and take all their inspiration from their own past games and the only one that they made that was considered modern was the original operation flashpoint back in 1998 or something. all their games past that have imitated that game and arma 3 design is still based on that game (read: doesnt work very well anymore, or never really did) if it still isnt very obvious this is a rage post. ive played the game for over 100 hours for some reason and i continue to play it but im still convinced that 10 hours in bohemias office and i could fix the design of this game.",129.3
"a relentless pseudo-turn based dungeon crawler, with no end of challenge. the game features only two immediate and apparent difficulties: too easy, and easy. dont let these difficulty titles fool you, theyre a lot more daunting than they seem. the dungeons are unforgiving, one mistake or failure to prepare can ultimately lead to your cascading loss of the dungeon. the already challenging difficulties can be further multiplied by selecting different escape pods that give new rules to your dungeon. the greatest enemy you will face in the dungeons isnt the monsters, its the random number generator. whats in the next room? monsters? dust? a much needed damage-per-second, or utility hero? maybe the room will be empty. who knows whats in store for you in the depths of the dungeons of the endless. this game is not for those who are looking for a casual dungeon crawler.",2.6

"very fun game once you get used to it. it is not like your usual fps where you can just run around really quick killing everybody. this is why i like this game. the maps are huge, which is a huge plus. no cramped, close quarter battles. and if your team is losing, vehicles! my favorite servers in arma 3 have to be the king of the hill servers. gg!",35.4

"i thought this game would fix the giant mess it created in the last arma game. i was so wrong and i wasted my money on yet another stupid pile of crap. when you cant finish the tutorial because it wont tell you how to aim down the sight or tell you what the hell barring 220 is supposed to mean i give up and shoot the drill sargent. game deleted!",2.5
"awesome and a must buy if ur a fan or arma games,nough said.",24.7
"one of the best and most realistic modern shooters out there. great online content and community. good campaign. amazing graphics. well worth the money if youre looking for an open world, modern shooter.",10.5
"this game used to be so fun, now i spend an hour or more getting started on my character only to be killed and have to start over. if you have alot of time to blow doing absolutely nothing then this is the game for you.",398.3
"arma 3 is a awesome game, 10/10. many cools mods and game modes to play online and the single player is fair fun.",764.6
"this game is awesome from the start , whos not to love a game where any mod works with it? from straight up war down to roleplaying 10/10",403.9
"i never expected i would get into these kind of games, im really the last one who is playing millitary simulations but with some guys the kind of the hill mode is really fun. if you never tried the game you should try it but a big but the game is horribly optimized, it crashes often, low fps, laggy.",76.4
"this game is a perfect choice for those who love themselves military simulators. while this game does have its downfalls, aka its glitches, they however, are not game breaking. slow paced gameplay but not so slow as to get boring. i recommend that if you can find a clan, group, or server that is great and lots of fun, stick with it.",511.8
"a massive improvement from arma 2 (especially the voice acting). but i find the main dissapointment is the lack of weapon diversity and choice unlike arma 2. overall an amazing game well worth the price.",86.4
"oh dlc, meh, not a big deal, i can probably take the weapons off dead bodies or maybe use them for a while as a trial. *gets in game* sweet, killed a guy, better snatch his sniper rif-. *purchase dlc now to use this weapon!* *uninstalls game* this is what i get for supporting these guys for years. way to go...",186.4

"i have almost 120 hours in this game and i still dont know half what it got to offer. it is simply the best game of 2013. if you is wondering wether or not to buy the game so buy it. the editor is the best way to experinece all the vehicles. play it as the game is ment to be played and you will enjoy it. if you are an battlefield or cod player dont buy this it is slow phased and you dont get you healt back after 5 seconds so buy it if you like slow phased and realistic games. this is the best way i can describe it. i have to go and play the game",439.6
"another amazing game from bi, arma 3 is great when playing with friends and even people you might not even know, some missions require teamwork or you will probably fail. although it has its pros and cons : pros: amazing engine nicely detailed gear and vehicles etc (not really an eye sore) somewhat good community a different campaign which talks about a island that is in the state of war. steam workshop cons: there are not a ton of vehicles and weapons, most of them are just the same. more clothing then actual things like vehicles. etc 9/10 awesome game but really needs more content in the original game.",414.3
"arma 3 is one of the best military simulators out so far i would recommend this game to any hardcore gamer because of the realistic situations and the way that bohemia have introdueced medics into the game rather than just recovering over time like in call of duty or battlefield. 10/10",206.6
"feels incredibly unfinished and incomplete on so many levels and in dire need of major improvements and added content to make this as interesting to play as its predecessor. which is a shame as the new infantry controls are a godsend but it does not save a really marred and blemished product that is very lacking. frankly youre better off waiting until the first major expansion until you get this game unless you simply have to play wasteland.",455.6

"this game is extremely detailed and fun, if you want a good game to play with your friends, this is the game for you.",637.3
"this game is amazing. no other game can compete. the amount of things you can do is outstanding from playing on a tatical server to just having fun with frends on a closed server. looks amazing, plays well and they keep on adding stuff! 10/10.",191.6
"great for realism and simulation enthusiasts. but if your just buying this for wastelands or because you liked dayz, you can promptly  off and not get this game.",642.2
"metascore for this game should be 95% at least. this is the best war simulator for the general public. no cod, no bf can compare. the game is what i hoped operation flashpoint (2000) would turn out someday. awesome game and unlimited possibilities.",97.0
"it is hard to make a review of this game. realistically, every single person is going to have a unique experience and it will vary. the one thing that i can say is that performance and physics wise it is much better than any of the previous armas; however, i think that it lacks the content arma 2 had. if you have time and patience you can mod the hell out of this game to make it into what arma 2 used to be. if not, well, youre gonna be stuck with futuristic looking vehicles, guns, and awkward looking csat uniforms. if you dont mind the futuristic style content than it should be fine. i personally loved arma for the cold war - modern era equipment and the asthetic realism of it all which this game failed to deliver until modded. regardless of that i still absolutely love this game and going to continue playing it for as long (at least) as it takes gaben to release hl3",501.7
"do you want to feel like youre about to die, when youre actually not? do you want to feel the fear of almost being shot when you escape by just one hair? well arma 3 is the game for you, one of the most intense and nailbighting games ever. when you come so close to living the dream in altis life and you die can be annoying, but when you escape near death can be just as amazing as killing someone and picking up their loots! arma 3 is one, if not the greatest millitary sims ever! -ps you need a good pc. :p",164.8
"the best war sim ive played so far hell yeah! 10/10",200.9
"this game is fun. it has some pretty cool survival aspects and also has vehicles that arw somewhat stable. you should definetely buy the game if you have the spare cash :d",4.2
"i would definately recomend this game to people who like semi-realistic warfare. it has unpresidented modding support which allows just about anything you could imagine in the game. it has a vast number of custom gamemodes and thousands of mods. 9/10 really really good.",100.4

"itll make you rage... itll kick you in the teeth... itll suck the essence of your pc like no other (due to bad optimization)... but that sensation of being a tiny cog in a complex machine, of delivering precise cas strikes, of being deep into enemy lines, of engaging that enemy squad so far away from your location... defending kamino against the relentless hordes of csat, battling through the salt fields of altis in your slammer, flying low with your pawnee near the wind generators of the nw, engaging in cqb in the houses of kavala, providing accurate information with your darter while your men advance on pyrgos. it is your war... only thing is choosing how to fight it. the latest of bis, giving the player freedom since 2001.",552.4

"the experiences in this game, are unforgetable and only happen in this game. it can feel like a movie, except youre in it, and youre the main character. this game is a must buy, and i mean that when i say it. beware though, once you get it, theres no going back.",153.9
"its got nowhere near as much content as arma 2 but with an engine thats leagues beyond arma 2s operate hard a",55.9
"best shooter i have ever played, its not like other fps games, less arcade style and leans more towards realism but aside from that, the world of arma is just simple amazing and beautiful, very well made terrain and cities/towns, you can lose your self just wandering around.",49.5
"directing this too people that are coming from arma 2. this game is a complete upgrade from arma 2 overall. graphics are better, inventory system is easier to manage, and how the game runs is better. frame rate is better and more computer friendly for people that dont have super gaming computers. ai are harder and the campaign is relatively enjoyable. multiplayer is fun with wasteland and altis life. wide variety of vehicles and they added new play style such as scuba diving. 9/10 -bigh",86.8
"was alot of fun during the time i got to play it but it didnt run well i guess a i3 3200 and a hd6970 didnt work but now i have an i5- 3570 and a new gtx 770 im ready to play",5.2

"arma 3, a game for the few and the brave, but certainley not the masses. the realistic, and intense gameplay, accompanied by persistent glitching, and extreme system requirements make it a game the wearily excited might enjoy. arma, is arma, the gameplay is nunique has it gets, its a military simulation, enemis dont run at you with knives, and you cant shoot one guy thirty times. you play like your in a real desperate gun battle, or you get shot and die. the graphics, are great, but i wish the system requirements were more honest. with my two gigabytes of deticated video ram, eight gigabytes of ram, and intel i7 4700 mq@2.4 gigahertz. i run arma 3 with highest filtering quality, highest graphical presets, and fifty precent view distance. i get thirty frames per second on most missions, but around twenty in load times, and thats not half bad. just be ready to optomize based on your graphics processors control center, and in game quality control. in the end arma 3 is great, but taxing, the gameplay is challenging, but rewarding. if you are ready to spend the money, then just do mit! if not, then run away, with the arma series, its either a hit or a miss.",27.9
"one of the best walking simulators on the market. challenges even day z",2.3
"insanely boring. after the first few days of playing, i finished the campaign and went into multiplayer. once you finish the campaign, there is absolutely nothing to do, because nearly every server on the multiplayer is either broken or the same thing as the last one.",46.1
"great game when played correctly. hard to get used to and the community isnt very helpful, but it works out eventually. best played woth friends/people you know that wont  around. i give it a 7/10 for its great graphics, superb gameplay, and immersion in modern combat.",1.4

"ultimate boredom simulator mixed with dates 90s interface. even a custom multiplayer game gives you extremely limited options with little to no context. while the performance has been improved, just navigating the menu to play a simple multiplayer game comes with its own learning curve (opening a port to play..wtf..am i in 2005?).",1.2
"i do recommend. what is needed for the game is fair enough of a free time. especially have on mind, that setting up a good multiplayer experience is a matter of many hours. animation were greatly improved and ai as well. only negativum for me is not using all the game very promising mechanic in the sp part of the game and very weird ending (all options) which was done under a rush i believe. if youve grown up on flashpoint, this is a must have",45.7
"love it! very hard learning curve, but well worth the effort. you do need a bloody good graphic card, mind you!",18.9

"ofp (operation flashpoint) and older arma games often seem to impress - its just a shame it goes so slowly",263.4
"although i only played the free weekend my experience with the game (king of the hill and altis life) was pretty amazing. my only problem with it however is the battleroyale servers because they are always locked during a match which can take a longf time so to improve this i would make an area so players can wait for the match to finish. i was kind of sad about this because that was one of my main reasons to play arma 3 but i never had the chance. thanks to gassy mexican for showing the game on youtube (and making me play it)",9.7
"i am hiding behind a rock , the bullets richohet on the rocks top and hit the grass behind me. its a foggy day so i cant see much , puting my head out would kill me. i need to work out were the enemie is shooting me from befor they can flank me. so i observe the impact on the grass behind me , i can barly work out based on the impact of bullets from what direction they are firing. i peak out shoot about 10 burst in there direction and toss a grenade. i go back to hiding and crawl behind a tree that was near the rock. i can hear or see the enemie but i dont know if i killed them. so i slowly walk in a half sercle around the grenade impact. i see that they both went to were i was last. i aim , shoot and kill them both. non of this was a scriptied event it just happened. armaiii , like all arma games is a military sim that depends on both the devs and moders to give you the best military simulation out there.",210.1
"the game is awesome, it has some very good servers like wasteland and altis life. also breaking point mod is very good, but you need to download it separately. weapons and vehicles are very nice to play with. however you need very.. very awesome gaming pc to run it on highest settings and if you can play 100 player altis life server on ultra settings with 60+ fps, thats quite an achievement, i mean damn. warning, dont buy this game if you plan to play it on a laptop or a computer that can barely run other big games. +very playable and good looking even with lowest settings +awesome servers and mods +sea, air, and land modern combat -sometimes it runs like a potato if you dont have expensive computer",425.5
"one the best games ever, years of selfmaking content :)",143.2

"cool looking game but way too many issues still. enemy ai is still ridiculous. even the pistol still doesnt show up in the holster, yet they are releasing dlc. overall its ok but not really worth the current price.",102.5

"wasteland is great fun with friends and the game is very pretty, map could use some more development but other than that its an all round fun experience. i would not recomend this game to anyone with sub-standard hardware as this is no fun with anything less than 40 fps.",183.0

"one of the best fps shooters out there, you will love this especially if you love military simulators. think americas army 3 but on a planetside 2 scale multiplied by 5. the game requires quite the powerhouse of a computer though mostly due to the scale and insane level of detail. deffinitly take a look into this!",55.1
"i got global banned from both arma 3 and dayz sa because i piked up hacked money in an altis life server. complete",79.6
"this game costs like $60 now.. but it should cost more .. because its awesome! yee! best graphic game ever see, nice tactics and the best thing is that you can make the mission that you wish for. and post it to others. and also so many missions are already in the workshop. would give the game a 10 out of 10 :o",2.4

"fun game to play, especially with friends. i seemed to have been having lag or sensitivity problems with my screen movement, but other than that it is a really cool military simulation that you can really get into. i would recommend this to anyone that likes real, immersive, and tactical combat, and who also even enjoys a bit of role-playing. the graphics are great and the content is pretty cool. ive only played a few multiplayer and mission games with friends, but i definately enjoyed myself.",6.3

"i found this game swagadelic and extremely competitive! would highly recommend.",449.3
"being a big fan of operation flashpoint from way back when, this game is a great replacement for it. if you are tired for the arcade style, casual, fast paced and no skill requirment of modern games. (ie: cod and bf) and want something that requires, skill, timing, know how and realism. then this is the game for you. must like op:flashpoint, it isnt for the faint of heart at start. lots of keys, lots of actions you need to know. but with like anything else, put the time into it and you can do it. huge steam workshop community, lots of add ons which means more free content. dont like something? make it yourself. this game is great fun, though it may not be for all, its great for most. think of it as the eve online for shooters. nothing beats playing mp and being a good transport pilot to get your troops to and from battle or respawns. you can actually make a difference.",10.0

"in the same theme as carlsberg lager being probably the best lager in the world.... arma 3. probably the best mil sim in the world. superb in game graphics, excellent replayability, user creation mode is fantastic. more than enough mods are available, workshop for the user created missions, if you cant design your own. one major drawback to it... it requires high-spec machinery to run satisfactory. if you really want this though, sort your machine out, then spend a little cash on this game. its the most realistic military simulator ever. so damned good, it makes my balls tingle!",589.6

"of all hardware intensive games we have, arma 3 has the best muiltiplayer. when we arent lagging around the map, pretending to be wizards, we are experiencing the wonderous 15 fps, which makes it more cinematic, especially when you are using textures that look like they were professionally spray painted in ms.paint. 11/10 would play again!",5.6
"very fun game if you like real war games or an rpg game play altlis life recomend devils dog round up sever or dmm or war game mode",287.3
"you can play this title as a cod/bf shooter, a rts, a milsim etc. and its perfect in every of this senses! the game got made so that you can play it on every pc/laptop you could imagine. it runs everywhere but of course the graphics arent as good as on a gaming pc. the game fearures (the in my opinion) biggest and greatest community ever. there are hundrets of great addons, and they are all free! in conclusion: this game has everything for everyone. deticated server for lan-parties, very variable difficulty, great graphics, a giant open world, a free in-game editor and much more. simply a must-have!",417.2

"this game is awesome, the amount of customization and moddability is amazing. it is a bit too futuristic for some people, but there are tons of mods that can fix that. tons of fun missions, tons of amazing multiplayer content, this game is absolutely amazing. many people have issues with performance, especially when on multiplayer, what i say to that is oh well, turn down the settings and make do.",422.6
"a really interesting sandbox. basically build a story on your own, or play other player-made maps... includes normal deathmatch, coop story games and anything that can be made with your imaginations(requires some level of programming though) only for those who are willing to learn how to play and not just point and kill, like counter-strike. recommend to play as a group.",104.1

"the closest thing to a military simulator that i have found... and ive been in an actual government military simulator vr training ground before. also has one of the coolest communities ive ever met with lots of modding support. def. worth getting now at full price even if you missed out on early access and alpha.",37.3
"this game is amazing. with its various gamemodes such as king of the hill, wasteland, altis life and invade and annex,(all made by the community)this game is very fun to play with friends online. single player is suprisingly good for an arma title so brownie points to the campaign dev team. but i will say this, the game is a constant work in progress. i have seen it progress since alpha and even now, they are adding units and they are not yet done with the campaign still, but as long as it mantains the level we have been seeing, then i think its worth it. 10/10",315.4

"i dont believe that content-wise arma 3 lives up to its predecessors, however in terms of mechanics, graphics, interface, and controls, it is definitely worth it. if you want to know who i am, i am a guy who flipped off my guidance councillor and used his iphone to buy the supporter edition of arma 3 the minute it became available, after he had shut off my computer station. i live arma, i love arma. nothing on the market comes close. mods and the comunity really bring this game to life and are its reason for being. i strongly recommend it for anyone looking for a hardcore, insane, serious, zany experience. you can literally do anything you can set your mind to. happy operating my friends.",1018.4
"arma 3 improves on its prececessor in nearly every imaginable way. true to arma form, there are bugs and glitches and some graphical elements are a bit wonky, but the gameplay is substantially improved, the graphics for such a large scale are excellent, and the community is great. with dayz going standalone, and arma 2 maps imported into arma 3, i cant think of any reason at all to go back to arma 2. a great improvement in the series and the crown jewel of military simulation.",192.6
"i am new in arma 3 game just two days later and the problem appeared [battleye: global ban # 4648c2] i swear i have not used fraud i bought a digital widowed with a full dlc im not i do not know what to do",17.4

"a game filled with f*cking campers, watching the gun store with sniper rifles. killing unsuspecting players traveling to meet up with their friends to do the same thing. also, there are people yelling on sidechat on sector control, which is also another camping ground for snipers. there are also no shotguns and you will be bombbarded by jets and arrowplanes.",78.7
"how could this still be this bad.. still playing arma2 witch is much better",28.1
"ultimate military sim, plus procedurely generated warfare!",155.2
"just like arma 2, theres a huge amount of variety in gameplay with this game. the graphics are fantastic, although most people probably wont be able to run this game on full settings at a reasonable framerate. worth picking up, even if youre not planning to play it in the immediate future.",645.3
"one of the best tactical shooters on market! 9.9/10 edit: dlc policy! really ed up! payd 60 for that game, now they want 12,99 for 2 helicopters?!",127.0

"if you like getting killed in one shot and not knowing where you got shot from, you will like this game!",76.2
"this game offers hours of entertainment, especially in the multiplayer that is where the game truly shines showing off its true military simulation aspect. this game is complicated at first but not that hard to get down after your used to it your in for hour of enjoyment.",351.7
"like 2, except with equipment that would be too expensive to outfit all of todays modern infantry with. oh, and the swimming and underwater stuff is nice. it still suffers from frame rate issues, unfortunately.",57.0
"really good game. really recommend playing role-playing mods, they are so much fun.",604.0
"supported the game in alpha. didnt even get a discount on dlc which is basically an update. dont support this business model. its a great game if you like milsims, try to find it on sale with the dlc included.",22.9
"not recommended yet. as of jan/2014 bugs still exist in the game and the single-player campaign isnt finished. i bought it because i found it at 50% off and arma ii oa multi-player servers were fewer and fewer, except for day-z, but thats not my thing. what i dont like the most about arma iii is the small amount of content available (without mods) and its futuristic stance. its a matter of personal preference but i like to see vehicles and weapons that one can find in todays battlefields. and i really miss the taliban! graphics are quite good but performance in the game is a mixed experience, it can be ok for most of the game but then you get near an explosion and the whole thing slows to a crawl. my advice is: wait. even at 50% off. edit: after launch arma has been getting better and with some good and free updates. despite still missing some old content, im changing my recommendation to a buy discounted.",94.8
"imagine this: youre sprinting. under heavy fire. trees look like turds. sand looks like a solid block of chocolate. clouds are disabled because your computer cant render them. oh baby, and those shadows...that you have to turn off because your game will crash. you lay prone and pull out your sidearm. suddenly! the frames skip. the game lags. you are shot and killed by a sweaty greasy 40 year old man. your game crashes. you came all over your pc. 11/10 much lag very death such unfair p.s. still is amazing",29.7
"its gorgeous, i love the feel, it can be very engaging. but even if youre a patient, not-run-and-gun player, it still can often feels like a puzzle game, trying to figure out the best way to solve the current problem. if thats your thing, great! if not, move along.",2.5
"good game maybe a little work but i see a lot of mods being made in futrue.",48.1

"dont...even...bother... not picking up this game! this game has changed my life completely. im now sober (6 months! i know, still keeping my fingers crossed, because of my relapse last year), and im also off heroin. last year was a difficult year for me, i was diagnosed with testicular cancer, something about the way i rest my laptop on my left testicle that managed to cause internal bleeding. ever since i picked up arma 3 6 months ago, ive stopped resting my laptop on my testicles, instead ive been resting my testicles on my laptop. i thank the developers of this game for creating a masterpiece, and creating a beacon of hope for when i needed it the most.",143.0
"a beautiful game. design and graphics wise, and not to mention more realism than outside your window.",400.4
"well for starters the game seems like it could be really good. when i first got it about a mouth age i tried it out the frame rate wasnt the best but very playable the i finally decided to trying to learn how to play and load the game up and now im luck to get 10 fps. ive looked around and tried a bunch of different things the i found on different forms but nothing seems to help. i get the same frame rate on low settings as i do on high so really dosnt make sence. its really to bad because this game is exatly what i was looking for. update: i thought i would give it one more try and i hadnt changed anything and now im getting 40 to 60 fps on high settings in single player so hopefully it stays like i have no idea what was wrong before.",90.0
"had a lot of fun on this game with mainly the wasteland and life mods",238.2

"this is the game! ive been playing bohemians games since the first operation flashpoint: cold war crisis. played all the next games and still love this kind of gameplay. theyve been improving the quality of it ever since and now it is an experience only playing can tell. 10 ou of 10 stars.",429.9
"for everyone that loves military simulations, best game ever, this is like battlefield and ghost reacon in one game :)",28.5
"this game is great. not only does it have a great campaign and editor, it offers multiplayer. it is 10x better playing online with friends. and if you ever do get bored with the vanilla game there are mods. a lot of them too. you can also download so many different mods. there are downloads for missions, guns, cars, and a whole lot more. there are also different game modes and scenarios that change how you play the game. this is by far one of my favorite games. so i truly do recommend this game!",386.1

"its pretty good. the setting and the pricing for the dlcs are a let down but other than that this game is fantastic.",86.6
"1-10 because i purchased it. i bought it in alpha hoping that a full game would be released but it still has not. campaign is a joke, because there are player made campaigns that are 10x harder and more complex. multiplayer server hosting does not work 7 times out of 10. there is virtually no effort by bohemia to release content, it would be very easy for them to release all arma 2 content for arma 3, the community has done it but its damn straight  to get it to work and it barly does even when you get it too. there are virtually no weapons in the game. all the good features for arma 3 are made by the players. they have released less content than one dlc of anygame. just goes to show europoors dont make good games. 1-10 would not buy if on sale for 5$. asked bohemia for my money back and they do not respond and you are not allowed to post on their forums.  tier company is  tier. this is a huge disapointment from arma 2 content wise. anyone who gives a good review didnt play arma 2. or has the expectations of a cawadooty game.",586.7
"this game is amazing, personally it blows cod and battlefield out of the water, then again those two arent exactly milsims, however this game is just brilliant, one minute you can be running through woods not an enemy in sight, next minute youll be surrounded by a squad of enemy soldiers and youre just screwed 10/10",161.5
"this game is nothing but amazing.... i dont have a bad word to say about this game... this game is even better when being used to play dayz.... a must have for any arma fan",168.6

"awesome game, most of times. on your first time playing its frustrating but on the other hand, a good game. must get your hands on!",170.4
"this arma 3 is i think the best war sim out on any platform yeah battlefield is cool and good but the scale and detail in this game is amazing and it gets better with every update and with the community workshop, it opens up the game to never ending ideas with the in game editor, and the new zeus addition to the game makes it even better and dont forget the mods. i love this game.",291.1
"get this  if u got a intel cpu den u get fps if ur  got amd u r gonna lag like a",161.7
"im not going to pay this money for this game - totally not, you shouldnt. 1st you should get a better gpu, and i mean a very good gpu, arma 3 still needs better optimization. 2nd wait for multiplayer fixes, it still has some desync insues here and there, multiplayer performance needs improvement. 3rd why do i need ot wait for multiplayer fixes when i can play singleplayer? - well arma is made for coop action, and by this i mean join a clan/ group/ unit that knows how to play the game correctly. 4th buy it and you will see it will be worth it!",653.4
"i completely stand behind this game. this is a military simulator so right off the bat you know that this is not the typical call of duty, or newest battlefield game. it takes strategy and teamwork to complete the missions when playing co-op. when speaking of multiplayer, you have so many options. i have not even gotten to the story yet because i have played so much multiplayer. you can choose to play some of the core missions that are included with the game, but you can also play mods that other people create, this is where i feel that the game excells. i have played many of the most popular mods to date on this game such as arma life, altis life, breaking point, epoch, and many more. i can confidently say that even if you do not like the core missions of the game you can sink countless hours into most of the multiplayer mods/servers that this game has. now for the only downfall i have come across when playing the game, you cannot play this on a low end pc, this game is very un-optimised and you need some powerful hardware to run the game smoothly. i have a gtx 970, and a i7-4790k and i still experience some bad framerates on certain servers and mods, so be warned you wont get 1000 fps, but that aside it is a amazing game. solid 10/10.",136.7
"the best military game ever. fairly realistic, all sorts of vehicles playable, huge map, lots of community addons and mods. this is the number one game that i love.",47.5
"i mean if you want a military simulator this is ok but arma 2 is where its at",33.9
"i can highly reccomend this game if you are into any sort of simulators, or realistic combat. i have had extreme amounts of fun with all of the user created missions, with or without friends. i reccomend once you have purchased this game to follow these steps to have an early look at the zeus free dlc as it can add a whole extra level of enjoyment with the mission ever changing due to your actions, in the state of mind of the dungeons and dragons role playing board game. this is ow you can have early access to the dlc: >purchase and download arma 3 >right click arma 3 in your steam library >click properties >up the top, you will see a betas tab, click it >the click the dropdown arrow next to opt out of all betas and change it so you are opted into the betas >click ok and return to your library, you should see an update for arma 3, around 1gb >if not, launch hte game, the update should now start >once the update has finished, launch arma 3 >from the main menu play multiplayer >from the server browser, find any server that is marked with a [dev] tag, this will be running the zeus dlc >play around on a couple servers, find which one takes your fancy >enjoy! that should be all i need to say, oh, have i told you to buy this game yet? jus jus just.... do it. take a leap of faith.",434.1
"this is possibly the most realistic and entertaining military simulator ive ever had the joy to play. my absolute favorite part is the flying. the planes and helicopters in this game fly better than any flight simulator ive seen. i have only experienced a fraction of the game, yet im already hooked. creating missions is very fun, but it takes a little bit to get used to the mechanics. i highly recommend this game. 9.99/10",30.9
"outstanding, my all time favourite military game. its great especially online.",320.1
"battle eye is so ing stupid got a global ban for logging on to a server",78.9
"its just amazing episaly with mods but the base game is amzing as it is the only one i botherd to complete plus the editor is really good for creating missions",50.4
"one of best experiences in multiplayer in my life. most of times i do mil-sim coop so this game is worth all money if you dont expect cod or bf like gameplay",286.3
"bohemia interactive have really created something special here, top of the line military simulator an experience like no other. for those unfamiliar with what a military simulator game entitles here is a few of the things you will be doing in altis and stratis the two maps in game which are ridiculously huge: - gokarting - flying helicopters to the max height and then skydiving to your death - dealing drugs and becoming terrorists in altis life - having a great time attaching .50 cals to your gokart and killing your friends - great community workshop maps and missions such as the lost doge and skytrack 3000 - having intense raves with glowsticks and coloured smoke the list goes on, in conclusion buy this game",75.2
"10/10 - best game ever! this is my favorite game. you might think arma 2 and arma 3 are the same thing, but there not. i have played arma 2 for a long time but you might say oh you dont have it on steam. well thats right i dont i played it on something else. so i really recommend this game. so stop reading this and wasting your time and play this game!",163.2

"arma 3 is very relistic. deff not a run and gun type of game. but best feature of all is breaking point zombie mod. the mod works great",407.7
"this software is beautiful, absolutely. but the game play is slow and frustrating, making it a negative experience. the ai is absurdly accurate too; you can hide back as far as you want and it doesnt help.... you could have run so far that those enemies are tiny dots even through your scope, hidden under a few bushes and trees a long ways away, and they will still repeatedly headshot you. then you can spend another eternity getting back to where you were in that mission. a few minor bugs aside, i found a couple bugs with the checkpoint system; one example is in an early mission where you are swimming from a boat to attack a small village with a few scuba buddies... but on several occassions that i restarted that mission the npcs would go completely brain-dead and do exactly nothing. it is a gorgeous product, i just wish there was a high quality game with it.",5.5
"i get better fps in this arma then in arma 2..... im not complaining. p.s. the fps is around 20.",40.0

"love how it crashes every 5 minutes. want $60 back",312.8
"great game. just passed through the 4th part of the bootcamp, and i am loving the game. when you get into firefight it is very tense and all you hear is gunshots and bullets flying past you, the vehicles are great to drive and to be driven in and the same goes for the helicopters that i have flown in up to now.",2.3
"great game, by far the most realistic looking army game out there !!",26.0

"have you ever wanted a game that makes you feel like youre a badass army dude? if so, dont buy this game! no, instead this game has an even better experience. it requires skill and teamwork in order to win. the map is huge too. not only that but the modding capability is very expanded. overall i would easily play this game instead of call of duty or battlefield any day of the week.",23.4

"not for casuals, cod spoons or bf3/4 unlock hoarders, and relatively closer to milsim then alot of things. its like an iphone, its good out of the box but great once you jailbreak it. standard is fun but finding and playing popular mods is where it really shines. great graphics and not sure why people sulk about it, have no problems running it on a rapidly aging rig. would recommend",477.8

"such a beautiful game, excellent realism and tactical combat, you truly feel immersed in a real war.... however arma 3 has major failings, firstly it is poorly optimised, runs on only a couple of threads, meaning the newer your pc, the slower the game will run. the review pc was a piledriver 4.5ghz 8-core amd with a 680gtx card, ultra high settings the game had the same frame rate as low settings - averaging between 18 - 30fps, which was jerky but playable, until you got somewhere where a tank rolled in behind us and started shoooting, then everyone there was down to 3fps. people say there pc runs fine, but half the people i know who play are barely able to move and shoot, until arma 3 is fixed and written properly to support modern hardward, you should not buy this game. the developers have never managed to fix arma 2, i hold little hope they will fix arma 3!",38.1

"i loved arma2, sepnding endless hours building missions, and adding 3rd party content. initially arma3 was the same, although it could be a bit laggy.... and then out of the blue, the audio became very broken, stuttery and utterly disjointed, and the game itself started running at 7-9 fps, whilst complaining that bacause it was modded (its not) and that i may encounter problems (i am). ive uninstalled and re-installed, and can see zero improvement - despite all settings now put to low. sorry guys, not good enough. it makes me question the value of steam, as arma2 never had any such issues, and with steam, i no longer feel in control of whats going on, and what is, or had been, loaded. very unhappy.",37.4
"the game is not optimized at all and performs like crap. the a.i. is terrible. enemies lock on to you, and never miss. landmines are impossible to spot so sometimes you just blow up at random. you also die in one or two hits from bullets. i get that this game is trying to be authentic but it does a really bad job at it. the friendly a.i. charge straight in because they cant die, while yelling at you to stop taking cover and move up. if you do try and move up you will usually be killed instantly, because the enemies just never stop shooting straight at you. outside of the campaign, the game still isnt very fun. the world is mostly just desert with a bunch of scattered small towns, and exploring it is really boring, even in a tank. the characters control awkwardly, which makes the enemy problem even worse because you cant react quickly to being shot at. since the game is out of its early access phase, these things probably wont get fixed. finally, the price. it is $60 as of oct 24, 2014. there are lots of other shooters out there, that offer so much more content, responsive controls, perform well on your computer, dont have lock-on insta-kill a.i., and cost less than half of that. i do not recommend arma 3",5.0

"this game is absolutely ridiculous in the fact that there is so much more to this game than shooting and killing. i was sick and tired of the neverending onslaught that is call of duty and battlefield. while i see both of those as fun in a fast paced competitive environment, i wanted to find a shooter that had more of a roleplay aspect to it. arma 3 is exactly what i was looking for. you cant just run out in the open and expect 360 across the map headshots while hipfiring with an smg (one the maps are huge and two bullet drop). cover can keep you alive while in a deadly firefight and can keep you alive while your buddy tries to save you with his gunship he stole from an enemy base. also, there is a free movement camera by holding the alt key which changes the fixed camera in typical first person shooters. you can be running into a forest while looking to your right and you might notice an enemy patrol and can drop to cover before they notice you. and then theres the mods. there are so many different mods to make the game sound and look better and modded game modes that add even further role play in the game. i spent about 80 hours in one week addicted to one of those game modes and ended up missing a few days of school because i was sucked in. this game is best when playing with friends!!!",191.1

"the best authentic military sim available. graphics are amazing, high attention to detail for such a huge open world. this game, like the armas before it is virtually endless with all the user created mods and missions. if you are a military fan, with realism higher than kill count, then this is the game for you. the devs are some of the most involved in the business. there are glitches and bugs, but for the scope of the game, it is understandable, but they never stop fixing and adding to the game. watch a few videos of the gameplay and you get the feel for how intense it can be.",46.1

"this is a really great game, ive enjoyed the arma series and with more optimizations this game runs better and looks nice. the physics are very good and not as glitchey as arma 2 but it still needs work. they are also still adding more features to the game and adding frequent updates.",517.2
"this game is definitely a direct improvement over arma 2. if you are familiar with that game, it is very easy to transition over to this game. i especially enjoy the mission editor. the mission editor has a pretty steep learning curve, but enough tutorials and trial and error will get you competent with the editors logic. the game is much better optimized than arma 2 was, but it still runs pretty awful on multiplayer, even with a high spec pc. i ended up having to turn down my view distance to a pretty low amount to consistently get 40 fps on multiplayer, because the fps largely relies on the servers power. on single player or a small server of 5-10 people, i could just about max out the game with a steady 60 fps. i am disappointed with the dlc though, as it really doesnt add much at all to the game at this point, and it retails at $25. i would recommend picking this game up, even if you have never played the other arma games, because it seems like it has a much smaller learning curve than previous titles, but is still just as in-depth. this game is a good purchase, especially on sale, the dlc on the other hand is not currently worth it.",62.7
"this is truly the best game ive ever played. buy it. youll have a blast. i recommend that you take a little time to learn/tweak the key mapping (or if the default keys are to your liking, keep them) and do a few tutorials on weapons. there is a lot of control in this game and it can be used to your advantage. after over 300 hrs i can only think of two things that i wish were different; modders help us! 1- we need knives as a weapon choice. sneaking up behind a sniper while hes not watching his back... a knife would be nice.... 2- i would prefer more rudder authority on the helis or at least a sensitivity option for it. the current seems a little bit lacking in that department.(like it was set up for first time pilots to learn to fly) all in all, i highly recommend this game and give it a big two thumbs up",527.6

"this game is probably the least fun game ive played in a long time. it tries to sell itself as a military sim, but its as much a military sim as minecraft. wandering an empty island for hours until you get shot by some guy six miles away is not fun. also, 60 dollar price tag? games like red orchestra 2 are so much better than this and are much cheaper. youre money is better spent elsewhere.",7.8
"do not buy! i wasted 35.99 on this and i do not wish others to make the same mistake. theres no excuse for this game to be as poorly optimised as it is, perhaps because its made by a company in the czech republica which is the heart of poverty driven eastern europe, this is a not a console port its a pc exclusive so theres no reason for it to be so badly optimised, im so angry now but those creepy eastern europeans have my money so thats all they care about it. the reason im so angry about this because i have a fairly decent pc my specs gpu:amd r9 270 cpu:amd a8 5600k ram:16gb it goes down to 10-20 fps on ultra and 10-20 fps on low. i only originally had it on ultra because it recomended it on the configuration, i played the tutorial and the fps was fine, when i played the first single player mission thats when the problems started, i feel so revolted at this diabolical excuse of a game. theres so reason the fps should be this low if i run the new alien isolation game on ultra with 60 fps. this is ridiculous and im fumin, i want them to fix my game or give me my money back.",0.9

"the greatest accomplishment a game can have is to leave lasting memory with the player. i find that this is especially true for memories that you can share. arma 3 can provide these in abundance. it is easily one of the best sandbox games i have ever played. ill never forget escaping from a temporary prison with a handful of friends, spending hours slowly and stealthily making our way to a heavily guarded communication tower, taking out an entire platoon in a surprise attack, and finally making contact with friendly forces for extraction, only to be told to rendezvous on the opposite side of the island. of course, the enjoyment of these games is also dependent on the people that you play it with, so be sure to pester all your good friends so that they can play this with you. for as graphics and physics heavy as this game is, it handles surprisingly well. gameplay wise, you will have to relearn everything youve been taught for fpss. if youre not extremely careful and working as a team, youre going to die swiftly and painfully. the number of player made missions is amazing. this game has a bit of a learning curve, but not nearly as much as the previous titles in the series. please, if you want to have some fun with friends, get this game.",31.1

"i would recommend this game at full price. totaly worth it. i barly know anything about the millitary or fps and i picked it up really quicky. fun to screw around on multiplayer and other gamemodes.",126.8
"this game is totally awsome, i like the most altis life, it is totally awsome, has like cops and civillians and ems medics for help, the graphics quality is very good, the mechanics of engine is also good, this game is very awsome. i wish that bohemia interactive will release arma 4, wich means that it will be sooooooooo freaking awsome. wish you the best of luck :)",165.6
"easily one of the best military simulators on the market. if youre a fan of arma 2. youll be a fan of arma 3. although the game has slight optimization issues it overall doesnt effect the game drastically. highly recommended a beefy/above average computer before buying. side note wish the games flight aspects were made more realistic. good military sim recommended. 8.5/10",259.5
"ur last update sukx so bad. what did it for me is yall changed the sniping scopes to 10x zoom max and u cant even snipe with that, im a longrange sniper that snipes from 2 km and have to the 60x zoom that was on the sos and until u bring it back im done with ur game, i am not recommending this anymore because of what u did bohemia. this used to be the best game ever until they changed sniper scopes max zoom bohemia yall suk, not everyone uses marksman rifles some people use the sniper rifles and actually snipe people from 2 km with the llr and if u dont put the scopes the way they used im going to uninstall, rightn now its not going to be played, u got a week to fix it or i will uninstall, and give really bad reviews on every single site",386.0
"i first started with operaiton flashpoint which was basically seed of arma, i then got arma2. now i have arma3. now much has changed, but better graphics. pros -nice graphics, -great freedom -military simulator. -good story -great fire fights (in city area and town areas) cons -ai seems to be diffcult, seem to know where you are really quickly. i found it diffcult in fire fights in forests because the grass and if you stand up you get shot. -objects such rocks collision box seems always get in the way. -game mechancies dont seem to work like other first person shooters (takes a while to get used to) -extremely simulated to point you have two types of walks and runs which can get confusing. conculsion, its a really indepth game, great exploration and different type of senarios. i think the development team should consider re working the ai and create an option for a more simplifed control system, maybe even enabling the option to disable injury simulation. i think this causes many frustration to people playing the game.",9.2
"it calls itself a realistic simulator game and it is. -great graphics -good campaign missions (scenarios or showcases) -full sandbox mode -multiplayer -wonds affect the player one bad thing is you will never stop looking at the control menu for the first few hours until you figure out what keys you will be using.",19.6

"i love arma 3 and it is the best game i have played in a long long long time",25.5
"this game is amazing, so far its the best game all around i have played. it has amazing graphics, lots of differant simulations, and endless replay value. the main campaign is not part of the game at launch, but is a free dlc in 3 differant installments. the fact you can play this game in first or third person, increases the amount of people this game can apeal to. the learning curve is a little rough, but after a few times running around doing missions or just playing around, its super easy to pick up. again graphics, a++ if you dont have this game yet, its worth the money, i got the game during alpha, i got one for my wife in beta, and now the full games out, and it just blows alpha and beta away with how amazing the game turned out to be.",44.4
"cool game, very complicated controls. do not attempt with a controller and be prepared to spend hours learning which keys do what.",39.1
"great game!!! a more adult battlefield 4. good graphics and the best modz ever!",102.2
"ill sum it up as. there is a steep learning curve. you cant just pick it up, join a multiplayer match and start shooting people. its not that kind of game. it is however a very team oriented combat simulator. whether is a sniper team of 2, or a fire team of 4/6. you work together and rely on each other. once you get the hang of it, you will love it and keep coming back to it even after playing battlefield 4 and cod.",788.9
"glitchy. its been out for a long time and i finally got it but im not into it at all. love flying helicopters but maybe 20 minutes or so in, the flight stick is suddenly unrecognized and i have to restart. its infuriating. added to a whole other mess of glitches and lackluster multiplayer (for me anyway) and frustrating single player. ill rate it a meh. ill be hated for it, but thats okay.",10.8
"this game is great, especially with friends, breaking point also adds so much to this already amazing game! :d",230.4
"if youre a call of duty  dont get! this game is even more massive and beautiful. only complaints are the low frames and futuristic setting. otherwise its a great game. with mods like altis life and wasteland theres so much to do in this military sandbox!",544.9

"an awsome war simulator with an editor that creates unlimited possibilities.",23.3
"bought it in alpha for wasteland after enjoying it so much in arma 2. not too much was added when it went through beta and final release. now with zeus, battle royale and a lot of other addons and mods coming it, there is too many reasons to list to buy and play this game. ive easily sunken another good day off from work just playing zeus with my clan.",370.6
"arma 3 is a fantastic online mil-sim with a beautiful setting and scenery and is the closest anyone can get to hands on military experiece. however there are a few bugs especialy one that i am experiencing which is that i cannot complete the last mission in the first campain chapter: survive, because i am unable to board the speedboat to leave the area. otherwise it is a great game with a fantastic variety of online servers including rpg style servers and the more serious co-operative senarios and even hunger games style servers called battle royale. overall, a briliant game that i would recomend to anyone looking for a fun mil sim or even tactical fps.",67.6
"this game is something unique and special pros: -modding community makes aditional content almost infinate. (there are some mods in development that look very promissing, im looking at you dayz epoch for arma 3) -massive map to explore -scenarion editor makes almost any imganinable scenario possible -extremely relistic (this could be a con to some) -graphically impressive for its size -massive longevity considering both the mod availiability and the scenario editor -very detailed environment cons -buggy, like very buggy, like has the potenial to ruin your day buggy -very steep learning curve, prepare to spend the first few in game hours learning how to move let along fly, drive, command a squad etc... -so buggy it deserve two mentions. -poorly optimized. no matter what setting i use i cannot run anything over high and even that ryns at 30fps. dont even both if you have a low end pc. overall this game has things to offer that no other game does but it suffers because of an engine that is difficulty for any pc to run. i fully recomend but understand if you pass it over because it looks so intimidating.",134.9
"great game to play with friends , interesting mods . 8/10",55.1
"if u like war and gta youll like this game its very cool huge worlds,bigger than gta and all those battlefield i highly recomend this game very cool not that many girls so if ur a girl youll be getting free stuff and alot of gentilmen are gonna wanna team up with u lol",621.5

"deffinatly recomend this game, ive spent over 800hrs on this and have loved every bit of it!!!!!!!!!!",926.0
"comparable to minecraft in its diversity and modability while maintaining a smooth and beautiful mechanic and graphic theme. endless options for modding but also includes a campaign and scenarios for people uninterested in mods. once youve played arma 3, all first person shooters seem to be lacking depth. i highly recommend this game.",757.6

"this game is a lot of fun to play with a friend. especially altis life, and wasteland. i had just spawned in on wasteland and there was this guy so i shot him and he apparently had a helicopter with him so i took it and flew off. while i was flying around in a blackhawk heli. a jet comes and starts swarming me and trying to kill me so i land the heli somewhere almost explode cuz of mah mad skillz. and got in a car and was sniped out from the back of the car and died from a guy named jake from 3000 meters off into the distance. and rage moded for an hour. cuz im pro. get this game. it is a heck of a lot of fun.",43.6
"would be good if they fixed the performance issues and shiity servers and the compatibillty with different drivers ect. come on arma ing get your act together! :d re edit: arma 3 is a decent game with alot to do and is very fun, it may have quite alot of dsync but still. it is very fun to play with friends especially on my favourite altis life where you can process and sell coacaine and even take marjeuna. this game is good but you better have a good pc, and hopefully a 15 or better otherwise your screwed and though amd and radeon is good, its sadly not good for arma. but stilll this is an amazing game :d",38.6

"since modern warfare 2 this is the best game i have played. although i liked the call of duty francise, it has lost its way and has become a game of mindless running around chasing xp points. arma is huge, fun and needs more care to complete your objectives. although it lacks instant multiplayer gaming, there are only a few games to play, you can create your own or download one from steam, all free of charge. it took a lot of getting used to but i love it.",616.8

"this game is tough as balls and is nothing like the fps that i usualy play, very little pick up playability. i was not used to every button on the keyboard having a key binding. for me this is worth $30 not the $60 that they want, super fun, but for me, not worth the price",4.6
"great game as long as you dont play with hackers! 8/10",122.6
"i have always been a fan of the arma series because its really different than the other shooters. there are so many different ways to play this game, i spend hours scripting and fooling around in the editor for my own enjoyment. i dont play multiplayer that much but its still a great experience when i get to it. this game is very heavily gpu and cpu dependant so i wouldnt reccomend this to people who have a low-mid range gaming pc. mid ranges might still be able to run it but you will get lots of fps drops below 30 fps. this game is really fun and easy to get into. i am proud of the work that bohemia interactive is doing and continue to be a fan of their titles. i rate this game a 9.5/10.",203.2

"arma 3 does a good job at improving many aspects that were lacking in their previous versions. most notably, in my opinion, is the ability to dive underwater without dying. helicopter flight dynamics seem to have improved, although they are still not realistic. i would like to see vortex ring state (now implemented with helo dlc, thanks!), limited power during hot/heavy/high altitude operations, and a wider ability to slingload realistic loads (partially implemented in helo dlc, thanks bi!) into battle.",155.1
"10/10 best game for players that love tema work!!!!!!!",692.3
"i think this is a great game. you will probably learn alot of it, depending on how you play it. you can play either ways, the typical action game way or the simulator way. but back to the point, there is so much to do in this game, theres a big map and great graphics. a well made game, worth buying if youre into these games.",43.2

"amazing sand box game. dont come here expecting fast/arcade action like battlefield... this game is a marathon, not a sprint. single player is still plenty fun, multi-player is classic arma... the campaign is a mix of unfair vs. too easy depending on your loadout and how many saves you allow yourself. some modding is essential to get the best out of the game as well. if you like doing mission design, youll have a blast with the tools provided, but they are almost completely undocumented, so its pretty hard core getting started.",416.3

"fantastic game. a really immersive game that you can pump a lot of hours into. plus an incredibly complex and expansive multiplayer.",51.4
"arma is a great game. there is so many game modes it is like 20 games in one. king of the hill sort reminds me of battlefiled and altis life is obviously gta. it also has a great well made missions. i got this game from watching videos on wasteland and already played wasteland in arma 2 i thought i must have this game. you love the way you look... i guarantee it",277.7
"completely recommend it, its one of the best games ive ever played, the great realism and tactical ability allows you to do practically anthing you want within the boundries great gammodes and mostly good comunity, always going to be one of my favourite games, hope you enjoy it as much as i have, try it even if your not sure, i can almost garaunte youll love it!!",146.4

"ok time for me to get around to this. at first, coming from arma 2 vet, it was quite confusing to play seeing how control are tad bit different. however i quickly learned it was for good. you no longer need to scroll and select action menu. for simple item, you can just enter boxes, open door, pick up item just one click away. for complicated stuff, action menu is there for you. but remmeber, do use mousewheel select or youll shoot instead. haha. also gears are now inventory. so thats i not g because g will drop a nade and kill you. now for the game. i personally disliked the future theme it had going on. however, thankful for armaholic and super easy new mod system. i was able to mod the game back to current year. not 2035. i recommend getting a faction addon such as canadian force or us infantry with nato - spetsnaz weapon pack. they will make the game more better. now i am making scenario like madman and playing it. love how you can customize weapon, love how you can select gears and helmet to use. (grass helmet for the win) vanilla 4/10 with mods 20/10 also you dont need to wear pant or condom to play this.",120.5

"an epic, realistic army simulator! this game is incredibly amazing and stunning as you are playing a role in the army. unlike any other shooter/army games, arma manage to give the player a open-world battlefield. the map is very big, there are a massive range of weapons, outfits, vehicles, helicopters, boats and planes. problems: if you are thinking about buying this game, please be careful, when i bought the game, it shocked me when the game ran at 10 fps at low settings, i had to buy a complete new graphics card in order for it to at least run above 40 fps in medium/high settings.",348.8
"one of the best simulation games ever, and even if you dont like simulations, arma 3 really has a game mode for everyone, and already has provided me some of the most epic moments from any game i have ever played, though the only problem for some people seems to be optimization on more demanding servers, but being someone that does not like paying alot for games, arma 3 was worth every penny.",80.5

"several steps in the right direction over arma 2. the new bullet projectile mechanics are top-notch.",207.5
"amazing level of control and realism. great variety in gameplay when playing as different classes, with different weapons and vehicles. however, this game still has ye olde arma feel to it, meaning that occasionally youll have to wait a decade to join a server, you suddenly drop to 2 fps, or get lifted into the air. the amount of fps you get also is kind of terrible i must say, but hey, its a beta, and itll get some kind of polishing before its released, im sure about that.",12.3
"tbh, i havent expected that arma 3 ever get in a state that its playable. but now, nearly stabil 40 fps on invade&annex and a lot of fun. buuuut.. atleast its a bi game, so wait for a sale cuz its not worth 40$ ... sry bi iam just honest <3",63.7
"well... to start off im not a very big third person fan but with this game i think it beats all first person shooters. i have now logged over 400 hours with in the first months of owning this game. this is by far the most adictive/relistic warfare game i have yet found on the internet or (steam) this game re-defines warfare to omg need more, i highly recomend this game to all who like warfare. p.s. in order to have loads of fun get a group of friends or forum a group to play with",758.7

"biggest issue: aiming was messed up with an update which actually promotes camping as taking shots makes you really unaccurate. graphics: very realistic and nice. textures are hit and miss but ragdolls are awful. desync and hitdection kill the multiplayer. performance is awful with any hardware due to unoptimised engine. story is generic. ai are either god like or brain dead. overally lacks a lot of features and fixes but had a lot of potenital.",13.8

"arma 3 is easy to explain. imagine arma 2. now add proper stances to it, alot better performance, alot of fixed bugs (alot more introduced aswell) and on and on. arma 3 is a good game for what it is. the main problem is: the devs are ing lazy, they didnt bother modelling lots of civillian cars like in arma 2, instead, 4 or 5 that just have different skins. about 1 tank per faction. 3 or 4 helicopters and  me, only one ing jet. i mean thats ing lazy. the amount of content in arma 3 is ing embarrasing compared to the shear amount of content in arma 2. bohemia interactive have done a great job with all the new content etc. but this game should still either be in alpha, or very early beta. not a finished game. overall if your reading this to see weather you wanna get this game or not, its down to you. if you want a game that runs and plays really well, if you can look past the laziness of the devs and the lack of assets, then get it. if you cant however, just stick with arma 2 until the devs actually do something about the lack of assets etc. again, this game should be in late alpha - early beta. not a finished game.",19.0

"the latest iteration of bohemia interactives fantastic combined arms military simulation series, arma 3 provides players with a vast amount of gameplay, both through official content and user-created content. the sheer scope of the title is incredibly impressive for any developer, and the quality of the tools provided for users to create their own dynamic experiences is a strong selling point for this title. gameplay in the title is diverse, ranging from the more serious military operations to the more lighthearted experiences such as altis life. the mission editor is a joy to work with, and can allow for even novice players to begin crafting whatever scenario they can imagine. overall, i would recommend this game to any gamer who is patient enough to enjoy a realistic infantry simulation, with semi-realistic vehicle simulation included. the game does require a fairly powerful computer, which may deter gamers with lower-end systems.",44.9
"animations are more responsive, some of the new things introduced are nice, everything else is terrible. for the time being this game remains unplayable for me due to performance issues, lack of content, seemingly uncaring attitudes by the developers and a portion of the fanbase, and general disinterest in the story of this particular campaign. unless by miracle i find a monster gaming rig behind my house one day and major changes are done to the game and to peoples mindsets, i doubt i will return to this game any time soon. seeing where this game seems to be headed, i doubt any major changes are coming. im quite happy with operation flashpoint and arma 2 in the meantime and for anyone looking for a good mil-sim or just a fun time with your friends, i suggest you buy one of the two aforementioned games instead of this. edit: to clarify, i meant operation flashpoint: cold war crisis, the first game of the operation flashpoint series, which i believe is now called armed assault: cold war crisis.",21.8

"game = mods great game! constant hours played on altis life and a3l. the fact is this game is pretty boring without the mods added into it, most will agree with me! i think the highlight of what made arma 3 a popular game was the altis life mod which made a fun environment where communities could form and do rp within the game, that mod is recommened. however despite having nearly 150hours just on altis life, a new mod a3l i has sparked up and taken over in opinion. the mod is a other rp mod like altis life however more shops, a new map [lakeside] and is taken more serious but is more fun to be fair. from robbing banks to being in a high speed chase as a cop, you can do it all for yourself here. arma 3 is the game for you to get into the modded games community for sure, you may even make your own community out of it [own a server]. note this game also has improved graphics from arma 2 and really is smooth when playing [no more desync]. ratings below: arma 3 [no mods]: 5/10 arma 3 [mods]: 10/10 thanks",558.7

"new mechanics, less gear. thats all i can say. i miss the mass of equipment in arma 2, now a days you can buy some more  purely for vanilla mp servers. so yeah, equipment is in lower quantity with a bit better quality. the downside is the s want you to pay 66 bucks still, i payed around 30 or so when it first came out. so, i recommend this game, lots of cool , but on the other hand ill point out the lack of crap in comparison to arma 3, also vanilla maps suck. modding it is a helpful option to deal with the lack of vanilla .",391.6

"whoever is over the aiming department .to you sir i say.....duh....duh...duh...downsyndrom you   .i shoot alot in real life and this...this is just pathetic,like truly pathetic.the skill it takes to hit someone running without a gun is just godlike.in real life hitting fast targets really isnt no more difficult than one moving slow but yall act like it takes a navy seal to shoot a gun.i dont know if yall are part of the anti gun group that thinks you dont have control of your gun while aiming but you do.even a 5 year old does",239.5

"you can pick apples!!!!!!!!!! you cant do that in any other game can you",16.8
"this game....ooooh this game...is amazing. its a first/third person realistic tactical shooter. if you are a person who plays call of duty and think you can run into a room witha sniper rifle and g37 th053 sw33t yy360quicks20p3s 1addersta1ls, then this game is really not for you. the campain is meh but the multiplayer is where the fun comes in, you have altis life a sort of rpg gamemode, patrol ops (my favorite) where you look for enemy encampments or chemicals and deal with them, teamdeathmatch, and tons of others. if you have played previous arma games you will know that the controls are a bit...odd...well, in arma 3 they are still kinda odd, but they are better. there is an entirely new mechanic in 3 called the stance system. basically, if you are standing you have four different poses that can help with almost each and every situation, same goes for the four crouching, and four prone. there is a decent range of weapons and atachments and no limit to clothing options. the one big, and noticable problem with arma...is its optimization...the game doesnt run well on some systems for seemingly no reason.",204.3
"if you want a responsive, polished multiplayer experience, dont get this game. the engine is absolutely atrocious. even on low-pop servers (~25-30 players) with a 30ms ping, the game will desync, lag, the server will cause your client-side fps to plummet, etc. if youre fine playing an unresponsive, laggy, buggy mess, go for it.",42.3
"this game is the most amazing, frustrating, and addicting game that i think ive ever played. im really not even crazy about fps. the thing is, this can hardly even be called a fps. i am new to the arma series, and havent owned arma 3 for more than 2 weeks at the time of this review. what made me want to even write a review is the fact that this game is so damn hard, and realism is such a priority, that when you succeed the feeling of accomplishment is completely real. when you get in a serious fire fight you will feel hints of addrenaline. if youre not afraid of hardcore, unforgiving, ultra realistic combat, then do not pass this up!!!",114.8
"love it though i will admit, it still needs working on, the biggest issue for me is the bug where your clips disapear apon logging back in while youre on dayz breaking point for this game. mod by the way not the stand alone.",551.6
"if you like running with rifles, try this game out, because the titles might as well be the same! in all seriousness the game is very fun, giving an extreme difference to the modern approach to realistic combat. while it is not entirely spot on and the multiplayer is a bit poorly optomized the game definately gives a different taste to bring back life into a growing stale genre.",132.6
"this game is not for those who believe call of duty and/or battlefield is realistic. this is as close to realism as you can get without actually going to war. this is a breath of fresh air to anyone who wants an authentic military feel in their games.",946.7
"this is a must buy if you like shooters and strategy games.",93.6
"this game is a huge disapointment so far, like they took ace mod and used new graffix.",86.2
"runs like , dont buy until they fix fps issues, not even that intensive of a game but still cant run just makes excuses for their own incompetence .",615.0
"if you are looking for a proper army/war sim this is what you need. forget battlefield, cod and all the rest. arma iii is a sandbox true as you will find sim. not only that the modding community are 2nd to none, adding tones of extra content.",26.8
"great game, love almost everthing about it. i love teh movements, and the weapons, flying being easier and somehow more enjoyable, the great and beautiful environment, and much much more. the thing i dont like about the game, is that the updates dont really update our games... the updates make multiplayer server searching have issues searching and take about 1 hour to load the entire server list, loading one server every 10-15 seconds. you also get glitches when you host a server where you select a mission, but the teams, player slots, and the player list are all bugged out and cant see them. hope this issue gets fixed, then it would be my best chosen advanced military simulator.",85.0
"true battle simulator 2014 when you want it to be, but also a hint of rpg. obviously by a hint i mean the ~1000 altis life servers running right now. love this game, its my most played game. king of the hill, battle-royale, wasteland, breaking point, and countless life type servers make this a great game for programmers and players. worth the $60 i didnt spend for it. *cough* bought it *cough* reatil. *cough*",220.8
"ive had tons of fun in this game already and im far from done. singleplayer can sometimes be a hassle. ive come across a bunch of issues in missions forcing me to restart them, but i suppose that goes for every advanced simulator. if youre playing with friends youll never get bored. any sandbox gamemode will do. wasteland, altis life, invade & annex and so on... this game does require an above average gaming computer.",166.0
"dont get me wrong, this game plays fine and is really, really pretty so if you are after good graphics then this is your game. it just didnt appeal to me because at the end of the day it is really boring. this is coming from a guy who has played previous armas and operation flashpoint games and this one is by far the worst. pick up arma 2 instead and install a graphics mod. its cheaper and is more fun overall. just my opinion btw so you may totally disagree if you have the game.",2.4
"the best arma so far, but it is still quite clunky as a game. the ai is sooo much better than the previous versions. i wished dayz would have used the arma 3 engine. good graphics!",8.1
"do not expect to find a completed military simulator upon downloading the game. do a little research, get the mods from the modding community, and then play. this game will not have many of the most requested features, its always been up to the fans to mod the game to perfection, dont expect that to change here. with the right mods, this game can take hours out of your life. without the mods, this game will fall short of your expectations. do not get this game if you dont like having your game modded. if the mods arent out there yet, give it some time. arma ii fans, welcome to the next installment, its about to get intense.",285.2

"the gameplay is very enjoyable and the engine provides accurate simulation. it is heavily let down by the lack of optimisation and ai performance. while the desync issues have mostly been ironed out the complete lack of performance on even the highest performing pcs sees this game well under even 30fps. but i still reccomend it if you can push through the negatives.",677.0

"i have been a fan of tactical shooters for as long as i can remember, my first one being the original rainbow six and all of its additions. hidden and dangerous, ghost recon, and the game that spawned this one operation flashpoint. as buggy and screwed up as that game was i was still able to eveintually play it. not the case with this game. there is no excuse for the graphical bugs and gameplay issues present in this game. there has been ample time for this game to be optimized and yet it is still a mess. i am able to play every graphic intensive game out there on my system yet this one is barely playable. it seems some people have been able to get it to work but no luck here. this is unfortunate as it looks like i would love this type of gameplay based on my history however looks like ill never find out since i cant even get it to run properly.",61.7
"i have a fx-8350 and an r9 270x oc. on singleplayer ultra i get around 40-70 fps, avg 50 |render distance at 2500. multiplayer gamemodes with persistance high 15-30 fps |render distance 1000. severs without persistance around 45fps veryhigh-ultra |render distance 1500. there are other mods like breaking point and chenarus that are persistant, but i run 80 player servers at 40fps ultra. but this game base is mostly persistant servers with 60+ people. so i suggest a must buy if you have a i5 or i7 cpu and a nvidia gpu. if you have a amd rig, buy with caution. but further than specs, this game is really well crafted and is a magnificent game. there is nothing like it on the marketplace. at times it is a little un-realistic with weapon sway, and op npcs btu past that, pvp is awesome, the mods are awesome. 100% must buy for multiplayer.",716.2
"arma 3 is a really good game. if you love arma 2 strategic and realistic fpses, this is the game for you. but if you dont like strategic , and you rather play cod than arma 2, etc. you rather not buy this game. you like it, or not. arma 3 is really fun if you play multiplayer with your friends, or make a tunngle lan match and play co-op missions or sandbox. some buildings will break if you explode them with an rpg, like the tower in the stratis air base, try it for yourself if you have it!",229.4
"i really dont like this game because there is not enough content. the content they have is not very good, and it seems like they are turning this game in to a dlc whoring game witch really sucks.",416.3

"i want to recommend, and enjoy, this game, but i dont. because it is very buggy and feels poorly scripted. sometimes something as fundamental as interacting with the world, car doors, ammo crates etc. can be really awkward. this can abruptly lead to your untimely, poorly justified, demise. or if youre really unlucky youll lay around unconcious for 5 minutes prior to dying! :) i cant forgive the devs or the bugs in this game like a lot of people can. it has been this way since arma 1 - which i never played but understood it was unplayable. arma 2 which i did play and found unplayable. after two games, i find arma 3 to be barely playable. i figure by now they ought to know what they are doing and how to achieve a desired result. niche game. im sure theres a reason so many people love it. i honestly feel as though im not patient enough to both play a simulator game, and babysit the flaws of said game in order to get something out of it. i havent exactly got a hardon for military games like others do either so bare in mind that your phallus may differ. i would definitely change my review to recommend and play this game if it were just.. less buggy, more playable.. it really doesnt matter if you add gokarts or dragons at this point, just improve the game.",12.9
"life-like graphics and immersion would give any veteran ptsd. this game will turn anyone into a adrenaline junky instantly. the realistic gameplay and balistics are punishing, but at the same time very rewarding. this third installment of bohemias army simulator set in the near future on an existing island offers tactical gameplay and is enjoyed best playing in a squad. although lone wolfing can be done your survival chances will be smaller. the base game includes access to multiplayer mods like battle royal, wastelands, king of the hill, altis life and breaking point. high replayability value and a mission editor for those who like scripting all makes arma3 worth your money. requires a mid-high end pc to run properly. the gameplay can be slow. some mods dont run as well as others and suffer from desync. it has a few bugs and glitches, though nothing game breaking ive experienced so far. the movement can feel clunky and the controls/keybindings may take a while getting used to as there are just so many. i would reccomend arma3 to anyone who enjoys a serious militairy simulator.",89.9
"so much opportunity in this game. mods being produced every day with a lot on the horizon. definite purchase for anyone interested in milsim, fps, and rpg.",410.6
"arma 3 is a great military simulator which allows you to explore a very large map called altis and a smaller map called stratis with other players which leaves you fighting off the enemys who have control of the island. just recently bohemia servers have shut down due to steam buying out the bohemia and for some unknown reason, we arma 3 fans are still waiting for the servers to go online. it has been almost 3 months now and still no sign of the servers. this game is best when you are able to play with friends as i dont reccomend purchasing this game until bohemia interactive and steam sort out the server issues. unfortunately, arma 3 is going to be sitting in my steam library gathering cobwebs until the servers are back online.",26.5
"really fun, both single and mutliplayer. just dont expect it to be like cod... its more realistic, and not so much arcade action all the time. still in beta, but is already a kick  game. *but be aware* - this game makes alot of people act like butt*holes in multiplayer. find the right server and all is good! :)",176.9

"this game crashes more than it did in alpha, i have never played a game where me and the people i play with have to constantly repair files because this game is still in such a broken state. you would think with the price tag that comes along with the game that it would crash way less, have less fps issues, and have very to little glitches, but what we have is a overpriced unpolished p.o.s.",180.2

"good game, entertaining for hours :d still requires a lot of bug fixed though.",109.4
"do not buy this game if your single core performance is low. for example all amd cpu users, amd is always a good choice for every other game except arma. the game only runs on the first two cores of your cpu which makes intel the better choice. this game barely even touches the graphics card which in my opinion is very  backwards considering how advanced gpus are. the game would be fun if it would run, hopefully multicore support is a thing in a later date. i suggest and i5 or i7 processor if you are ever going to get frames online with this piece of junk. the game is fun though just the multiplayer servers have a trend of playing really  game modes such as stratis life and any form of wasteland. in my opinion the game should be more structured and focused on team based combat rather than every man for themselves on 200km squared (or however large the map is).",112.4
"everything is amazing except the game needs more gunzzzzzzzzzzzzz like in arma 2",1.6

"love this game. the main reason why is because of the people i play with. if you play on your own it gets a bit boring, however the campaign is rather good. playing in a small group or clan is great fun, tactics used and having a laugh are the best parts of this game. if you played arma 2 (and oa) alot, then you may like this game, unless you prefer the more modern/ww2 style. there is a variety of mods for this game but they are only really good for clan/group ops only, unlike arma 2 where that has entire new themes and a large mod list. i would definitley recommend this game to anyone looking for a laugh and looking for groups to play with. not to mention that the graphics are also stunning.",288.1
"a great game for military enthusiasts, those looking for a run and gun experience similar to cod or battlefield should look elsewhere though. its tough and unforgiving at first, but when the games mechanics click into place it becomes a tactical battle. the game is great for its multiplayer components and the modding community keep releasing some fantastic mini campaigns and scenarios. the world is huge and the selection of vehicles and weapons gives enough diversity to keep the game fresh. theres a lot of running and moments where nothing much happens, but this gives you time to admire the impressive graphics and vistas that are on show. would highly recommend to anyone looking for a patient, realistic and tactical experience of warefare.",136.6
"757 hours played, more than any other video game i own... more than bf4 and bf3 combined (my next two top played games ). if you like large scale warfare requiring lots of teamwork then this is the game for you.. just note that for the best experience, you need as big of a group of people as possible, combine with asr ai and you got yourself one amazing co-op experience.",820.9
"this game is a military simulator. its very fun to play and instead of running into rooms guns blazing like most shooters there is a lot more stratergy in this. it has quite a few mods that you can download from playwithsix and the workshop now. im in a group called special team delta and we do operations every weekend and they are pretty fun. even without my group i can have fun on public servers playing wasteland or koth. the story is very good and is a good length. there are optimisation problems with the game. i cant really get over 50 fps on high with my $900 computer but even on 15fps it is still playable.",547.3
"ive been playing the campain recntly, and omg its is amazin. so far i love it. it is the way that i always wanted to play arma 3, but its damn near imposbile without a great clan that does this kinda stuff all the time. so i welcome the campain with open arms. as for the game it self, you should only get it if you know what youre getting yourself into. this is not the avrage military shooter that we are used to. (not that there is anything wring with the avrage military shooter, i really enjoy those games as well) if you have doubts about getting this game, defanitly check some gameplay on youtube first.",52.2
"the story for arma 3 is great the voice acting is a mediocore but entertaing. the multi -player side is fun as well battle royale is great way to burn some time for sure. the domi and patrol ops servers are entertaing as well if you can find a group of folks that using comms and teamwork.",64.7
"had very fun moments in rpg servers, especially altis life",53.9
"extremely fun and a bit of an adrenaline rush at times if you are playing wasteland or koth, recommend playing with a crew and get some comms up for the ultimate experience! i plan to spend more time pew pewing baddies and taking their loot! quite and amazing amount of detail in the game, sometimes im amazed at the littlest things i see in game.",49.9

"if you are looking for a real challenging game i invite you to try arma 3 cause you will die more than once during the entire game and that is a fact, no matter how many fps you have played or action and strategy games they wont be too much helpful, you will almost need a real military training to play this game because its a war simulator and hell it is hard but fun. i did not have the chance to try the full game but from what i could its fantastic its an open world in which you need to find your way in to go though and there is not just one path. you need to take your own decisions of how you are gonna make one mission depending of your resources and plan every single move you make, otherwise you are welcomed to visit death,its like chess, if you did not paid attention to the moves of your opponent you will lose. you may be freely walking and up ahead there is a patrol that you did not see coming or you step over a landmine or even fall in your own traps which happened a lot times to me. yeah i know the game is frustrating but when you fit in the game it will be a different story. and lets not forget of the beautiful graphics and enviroment that the game offers. 10/10",9.8

"the most accessible game in the series, this is bohemia interactives magnus opus and my favourite instalment since the days of operation flashpoint (now arma: cwc) and its incredible addons, the technological leap is huge and the possibilities for the end user are limitless, catering to any taste with a very active modding community to boot, potentially taking it far beyond a mil-sim. i have owned this game since the alpha phase and has been worth every penny, its never been perfect but the development team are constantly striving to make it so. one of the greatest titles ive had the pleasure of owning on the pc for many years.",291.8

"on march 31, 1998, blizzard released a certain video game that allowed users to create custom maps that changed the way the entire game was played. to play one of these maps, you simply had to join a lobby where it automatically downloaded and you were good to go! on september 12, 2013, bohemia interactive released a video game that allowed users to create custom maps that changed the way the entire game was played. to play one of these maps, you simply had to attempt to join a server, realize it doesnt work, google it, determine which sketchy website was the official one for that particular mod, download the mod and apply it in your game folder, set some launch options in steam, then hope to find a working server. if you wanted to play any other game type after that, it would refuse to let you until you do the same thing for their mod, in addition to disabling your previous one (since you might be a hacker if you have files they dont use for their specific mod!!!). in addition to that, you cant even play the regular game. if you search for a team deathmatch server or something like that, there are no servers, or only a few with 0-1 people playing on them. this game might be good if you could actually play it... maybe.",9.9

"this game have the best realism where you can easily die by bullets, high recoil and no terms of one-man-army like most of the game these days. its possible to be oma but that requires many tries on each levels. the bad thing is that the gameplay is kind of boring because theres too many information that you recieved but less thing you can do. instructions/guide while in game sometimes doesnt help a new player to understand this game. too many button to use! the ai in singleplayer kindda dumb. the ai doesnt react to our command smart enough. realism : 9.0/10 gameplay : 5.5/10 ai : 3.5/10 graphics : 8.5/10 physics : 7.5/10 overall : 6.8/10",22.4

"i bought this game with the hopes that it would be an awesome realistic war simulator, it didnt go the way i thought. i wish that steam could let reviewers to choose a neutral option instead of thumbs or down. arma 3 is a really nice game, but also a bloody glitchy one. the game is quite enjoyable so far, but it requires lots of updates to make it even more enjoyable. to give an example of this is that some of the physics in this game are completely illogical! an example is a sports vehicle, you touch a single rock or tree on the road you can say goodbye to your wheels or hull, because the car seems to be made of paper, but when someone shoots your car, it takes like 3 clips to explode it. there are many glitches in this game that destroys the fun i have at some points, and i really hope they fix that soon. in other words, if you intend to buy arma 3, i recommend you to take it with a grain of salt, it would be better if you bought it in a discount.",69.6
"this is very addicting and there is alot u can do from creating your own game to playing in an altis life server. i think about this game day and night and cant sleep ever since i got it. i dream about it in my sleep and sometimes i get wet no lie. buy this game and together we can make babies.",89.3

"realism: this is the key of this game but it is realistic for real ? if youre a gamer you could probably say yeah becouse there are some elements that makes everything feel a real war... ...but (!!!) in my opinion this realism is not so realistic. war feeling is awesome but the bad things on this game are the details ( weapons reload, medkit others, repairing vehicles, your blood that desappears when you put adrenaline (???) in yourself...) this game is worth buying for people who likes the genre, but i expect more couring of details in next patches .",94.4
"unoptimized, has  game modes i can get in garrys mod, all game modes require you to suck the admins male sexual organ just to get in, and good luck if you can find your friends, because this piece of  doesnt even tell you, no, its not ing unrealistic to show you where your friends are, and it doesnt make the game more realistic, it makes it annoying and stupid. overall, im glad i didnt spend 30 or 60 bucks on this astraphy because this game sucks major monkey caca, 2/10 id rather play duke nukem forever",47.9
"in a game all about war, surprisingly you dont get much action unless your in a tank or in singleplayer. the best moment ive ever had with this game is where your about to evac and your helecopter gets shot down, and you and the survivors with no comucation to hq have to walk 10km while carrying a dead body of your comrade all the way back to the spawn. just walking and talking with your fellow soldiers. 8/10 ~agreenarrow",106.9

"arma iii, the fourth game in the arma series, if we include the original operation flashpoint as well. many mainstream fps gamers complain about armas style, because its unique? thats exactly why i love this game. you really have to find patience and a learning curve to this game. but once you have control over the game, youll find tons of enjoyable content. youll find yourself playing around with the editor, campaign with great storyline, 2 beautiful islands to explore, customizable gear, multiplayer fun as well as serious gameplay. what else do you want? yeah it might have some bugs and lag. but, if you look back at arma 2, not many complained about it though arma 3 is highly improved from the previous title. arma is a huge game that you will be playing for years to come. youll always find ways to emerge into armas gameplay. its ultimately up to you to be creative. because of bohemia interactives hard work on unique warfare gameplay, and immersive experience, id give it 9/10 :)",710.1

"for what this game tries to be (which is a war simulator) it fails misserably at that. the movement is clunky, the a.i is dumb and overpowered as hell. so if you get into this game being all like yeah, this is what war is like, this is realistic and really precise then sorry. you need to get out in the real world pall. because i dont consider a game that when you shoot the enemy in the head they are able to do a 180 turn and shoot you 3 times in the head before dying very realistic. same goes for boosting of stairs when walking down from them to quickly and breaking your legs. this game is however one of the funniest games i have ever played with friends. the amount of vehicles, the guns, the destructible enviorment. the overall map is not to shabby either. if you get this game for fun gags with friends and just cause overall chaos then this game is perfect for that. if you get it to play it as a serious war game then id say the clunky motions and faulty a.i ruins that emediatly",12.3
"the game is very immersive and you will get some unique experience in it. sometimes even the simplest scenario (you hiding from an enemy while waiting for rescue) can become really intense. i recommend if you buy/have the game you should try out tee times warfare (somewhat like conquest in battlefield but with a currency to buy your own vehicles) and wasteland which can become very hardcore, always expect the enemy to have a tank when you only have a pistol, very interesting. also the majority of the people you will meet in the game are helpful and nice people that are ready to cooperate with you. its always nice when the community is like this.",664.9
"best war game ever. its realism exceeds any expectations. it does have a very steep learning curve, so getting to be good in the game and actually like it might be a challenge. the best part is that it has room for more improvements, and out of its engine a lot of other games or mods can come out. its one of those games that can stick for you for years to come due to its complexity.",180.0

"arma iii in my opinion is a vast improvement over arma ii. theyve changed everything; making gun play much more well rounded, to smoothing out the driving mechanics. i enjoy the new equipment system, now instead of the old clunky backpack, you get a screen showing your character and two inventory slots (if youre looting a corpse, or picking something up) also if you remember the terrible main story of arma ii and operation arrowhead, then youll be satisfied to know that they did a complete 180 and actually tried with arma iii. i will say that i have some mixed feelings on how simplified arma iii feels compared to its predecessor, i do enjoy its easy to learn system, though i also feel a little put off by it as well. armas a game i play because of its somewhat complicated mechanics; if i wanted to play something simplified id go for battlefield or some other boring first person shooter. nevertheless this is a very well made game, and i urge you all to go and check it out.",11.8

"the worlds finest modern warfare simulator. pros: the infantry experience is sublime, with enormous map, beautiful and diverse environments, great freedom of movement and very comprehensive controls. inclusion of combat divers and paratroopers. aircraft, helicopters, wheeled and tracked vehicles and boats work great as instruments for inserting infantry and supporting them. real-world tactics works. great community, including a very comprehensive guide by dslyecxi. trackir is supported. a trackir is highly recommended, and adds enormously to both immersion and situational awareness. singleplayer campaign is competent, but i belive the most fun is to be had with user-created content or in online games with the milsim-crowd. cons: i would prefer contemporary military hardware instead of near-future. controls are optimised for outdoors action, and feels a bit clumsy inside buildings. controls on aircraft and helicopters are extremely simplified compared to dedicated flightsimulators. this is probably a design choice for reasons of accessibility, but the new dlc promises helicopters with more advanced controls. hope this starts a trend of more proper simulation of helicopters and aircraft. highly recommended!",137.6

"great game if you enjoyed playing any of the other arma series. already has life mods, and dayz mods available to play on. expect some similar to arma 2 bugs/quirks but nothing really game breaking in my opinion. a lot of the issues that comes with the multiplayer gameplay is usually server-side more than client-side issues, which even at that point i have not seen many bad servers. multiplayer is fun, steam workshop integration is awesome as well!",195.4

"this game has improved graphics, ai, and voices over arma 2. however, it features made-up weapons with really bad sound effects. multiplayer servers are generally suckish, but occasionally you will find a good one. the real fun lies in the editor and missions by yourself and with friends, the customization offers limitless replayability with the right mods.",166.7
"very good game. the campaign missions are less resemblent of what a military, simulation shooter should be compared to arma 2. its only worth playing to get a hold of the controls. arma is best within its coop, multiplayer, and mods. my largest complaint would be the difficult interface. theres too much reliance on the cursor and it gets annoying.",22.0
"this game where do we start..... well for starts is a good game with alot of game modes by default. king of the hill is probably one of the good ones for solo players or domination if you like teamplay. so this game is by no means bad vanilla but there is a problem, it suffers from the same thing that titanfall does. it lacks content of course there are a plethura of things to do but what the game does on its on really isent enough. that being said this game truely shines with its modabilatiy and is best played with mods as they improve the gameplay alot. so overall its a good game and i would buy again if it were lost somehow.",747.4
"this game is good for people who like fun, in realistic way. all fights are not so big but a lot more realistic. lots of gamemodes guns and stuff you can do in this game is just awesome, and i like it because its just thing, that hasnt been done yet by anyone else.

"easily the best, most polished installment of bis arma series. ive been playing bi games since 2001s operation: flashpoint. its amazing to see how the same engine (real virtuality) has evolved over the years, errrr decades actually, wow its been a while - now i feel old. so, in summary, arma 3 is a complex and realistic simulator that allows players to realize the rapidly impending date of their last breath, to know that every second that ticks by their billions of cells die just a little bit more, their neurons demyelinating, and their arteries incrementally hardening. its a firm unyielding grip that death has upon us, he authoritatively clutches the keys to the universe in one bony claw and simultaneously our hearts and souls in the cold phalanges of the other. thank you arma 3 for revealing the terrifying reality of my mortal existence. in death we are infinitely alone, no one to hear our trembling wimpers as we rock back and forth in the dark corner of an unending void of pure, sterile, black nothingness that warps us further into catatonia. score: 10/10",351.3

"awesome game, even more of an awesome group of devs. this game is amazing compared to arma 2. arma 2 was too clunky, i couldnt even run it. yet somehow i can run arma 3 even though it has way more advanced graphics and features. i really recommend this game while it is on sale.",63.0
"a very good game, extraudinary graphics, the best game if your looking for a game with a large community and a lot of variation, many different gamemodes such as epoch which has an amazing community and many servers, or maybe battle royal which is the perfect game for adrenaline when your running throught the forest hoping not to get killed, but anyway, now we come onto the bad parts: its rather expensive for what you get, they charge you for the actuall game but when your in a server and then u feel the relief of finding some kind of rare vehicle such as a helicopter, you find out you cant enter the vehicle because you need to spend more money on all the dlcs, when i found this out i just thought the game lost its touch. but its still an amazing game with great graphics, i also found that if you play it on your own or you like to play games solo you dont live the game up to the full potential, when i first logged in i instantly knew this was a game for co-operative play with friends where stratagy is the key but in the end, this is just my opinion of the game, i hope this has helped everyone who is thinking about buying this game and if you do, happy huntin boys :d",36.3

"the next generation arma awed reviewers with promising graphics and an intense single player campaign. what seemed like a would be goty quickly has faded away. as people slowly, possibly dreadfully make the switch to arma 3 they will see it is a myriad of misfortune. with very little solid content to speak of compared to its predecessor it has left people in want. the game has been an overall disappointment for me, with a lowered sense of viable large scale combat, and very little aircraft to be talked of i was sorely disappointed at bohemia interactives next generation game in the arma series. the only thing that has made it playable is the limitless community made mods to add things that the developers seemingly forgot from arma 2. this causes me to not recommend this game.",226.6

"as coming from arma 2 and what it gave was out-standing. arma 3 atm gives alot to do from player made missions to mods. with time to come am sure this game will grow. the only downside is the fps lag and servers with lots of plug-ins and player count. overall this is a great game and if you are fan of arma, battlefield or just looking for a game to buy i recommend this (10/10)",256.1
"arma 3 is the first game i wanted to buy after completing my computer. i have had previous experiences on a xbox 360 console but this is the first shooter i have ever played on a pc, and it is the shiz. arma 3 has a relatively easy learning curve that can get you mashing the right controls within a few hours of playing it. there will be times when your fps will drop down quite a bit, even if you are running top of the line graphic cards, but regardless it is in my opinion a outstanding game. is it worth the money?!?!?! huh cowboysandwich? if you are a arma noob like me yes it is, but if your returning to arma dont take my word for it, like i said before regardless it is a good game. you will spend a ungodly amount of your time playing this game. 10/10",87.4

"cant say enough good about this game, so much more fun than the run and gun games. i enjoy making missions and playing them with my friends, the mod community has to be one of the best ever... other than some bugs here and there which i know the game is constantly being improved upon makes it one of my favorites, if you are tired of the generic run and gun shooters and want a game that actually makes you have to think , ammo count, health, team members, this is the one. i got tired of the others. (wont mention their names ) they kept tweeking them and wrecked the games for me. so you could say i got tweeked right out of them. i am a little over a half century old and have been gaming for many many years. the operation flash point days were a blast, and to see this evolve into what it is today is just great. if i could add anything to this game, it would be the ability to jump, and maybe a flame thrower tank. and the ability to put c4 on a small drone :) i recommend this game for fun",406.2

"cant go wrong with a sandbox. if you dont like a game mode go find another. if i was giving it stars something around a 4.5 only because graphics could be better, controller support could be better, and personally i think the game has a hell of a learning curve from a standard shooter. took a few minutes to get used to everything. there has to be a way for the cod bf type to move over. if you did that arma would have control over the pc shooter market. however come on 4.6 these days is pretty darn good. worth every penny.",456.8

"makes cod, moh, battlefield, and every other modern-themed quasi-military game feel like rubbish. the simulation is fantastic, the realism is unmatched, and the gameplay is stunning. i was stunned by the alpha release: it was like nothing id ever played before. then the full release came around, and i was even more impressed. there are a few downsides to arma 3, dont get me wrong. the control layout learning curve is extremely steep, to run the game at maximum graphicical settings requires a very beefy set of hardware, and some of the servers suck. but, and this is a big but, if you are looking for realism, look no further. if you cant do something in the base game, i guarantee there is a mod somewhere to make it work. another plus is the community; because the learning curve coming in is so steep, it weeds out a vast majority of the 12-year-old cod crowd that we mature gamers love to hate. in closing, i highly reccomend arma 3, but be warned: it is not for the casual gamer.",71.5

"it will take about 20-30 hours of playing single player to figure out how arma works. then once you go online, you will spend another 10 hours until you really start enjoying it. but once you get into it, there is nothing like it, and it will be the most amazing game you have ever played.",100.0
"still a better fps than cod but thats not hard to make it better than cod anymore is it? only played a little bit of this game but i love it! the game is so enjoyable, i wasnt a big fan of arma at first but once i started playing this i just fell in love with the game! people moan and complain that this game is to realistic but how can a game be to realistic!? would definitely recommend this game, i probably wouldnt pay 36 for this but for the 24 i payed when it was a sale i thought that was a bargain, ive played just under and hour of arma 3 and after that hour i have fallen in love with it! arma 3 is great playing on your own and is even better when you play with friends!",3.8
"probably the best game for serious players who can work together to accomplish the mission.",90.5

"this game is just what you would expect from the bohemia interactive devs, a great game that is fun with a group of friends. you have many recuring mods in the arma series such as island life, wasteland, domination, and even an arma 3 port of dayz, there is even a gamemode only in arma 3 called king of the hill. with the multiplayer basis out of the way what about singleplayer? arma 3 provides a story driven campaign, and a couple of showcases i.e. infantry combat, aquatic warfare, etc. arma 3 is also returning with a more user friendly mission editor/creator, here you can make your own missions that you or some friends can test out, or upload it to the steam workshop. along with uploading you can also download others missions, some serious, some not. but other than that you should have a great time with this game. now for the cons (every game has some) just as expected this game is extremely cpu intensive, and gpu intensive, so if you are getting this game make sure you have a good computer. p.s. fps will be drastically higher in singleplayer compared to multiplayer i.e. sp 45-60 mp 15-30 depending on the server (some are crappy) beware!",47.7
"i dont really like the vanilla game, also the old arma ii missions like domination 2 and insurgency are terrible. but when you play in an experienced group with a few hundred mods. its freaking awesome. vanilla i dont like the gameplay and their are only a few weapons. but with some mods this game has no limits. try to find a group or clan who makes their own missions and you will have an amazing time. if not, good luck with the single player.",121.9
"by far one of the best military games on the market. this has many improvements over a2, most importantly, many bugs were fixed and the game runs much better than a2 ever would have. something else id also like to point out is that the campaign in a3 is by far better than a2s and there is just so much to do. only thing id like to come down on a3 is the lack of vehicles, but im sure bohemia will come out with an a2: oa esque expansion soon enough and i am definetely looking forward to it.",474.8

"this game runs at about 10-25 fps in the cities and unless you have a great pc this game will litterally be unplayable dont get it its not worht 60 dollups in any way the only time it is good is when you and your friends play either the most grindy rp mod that is pretty good becasue of its already built cities and vehichles or you can play the king of the hill gamemode with 5-15 fps and not see a single person until you open fire and miss them a million times, because you didnt steady your shot while laying down the only real way to kill someone in this game is by walking up to their face with a full auto gun and unloading on them. overall the game should not be bought until it is on sale for atleast 20 dollups off.",123.2

"i started of playing arma 2 but came out somewhat frustrated because of the controls and interface, the game explored new concepts but was not an enjoyable or intuitive interace. arma 3 and a completley different expirience for me. the game still looked and felt like arma 2 but they have fixed my few problems that i had with the previos game, making probebly the best expirience in a game ive had in a long time, the map armory 2 by happy comedy makes the game easier to learn alowing players to test out vehiclels, a must have map. the 60 dollar price point can turn people off but trust me, if you are looking for vehiclels, guns, boats, scuba diving, drones, tanks, cars, planes, helicopters, and a @#$% ton of amazing and cool mods, this game is definitly for you. -fuze",202.7

"the best combat simulation gets better with every release.",68.1
"this is definitely one of the hardest games i have played, i mean, i tried the first mission +30 times on easy and never survived the first encounter with the enemy. i had to find a cheat just to get past the the first battle, but the next was just as hard. i dont think dark souls is this hard, and it gets worse as you progress. one annoying thing is when your character gets fatigued from running he starts to pant harder than a vintage german porn flick, i guess nato must have lowered the standards in 2035. hell start panting after ~30 meter and it gets worse if you continue to run, even walking makes him sound like he a heavy smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. but dont let the single player main campaign scare you from buying the game, you can have much more fun with the editor. it takes some time to figure it out, but you can make really good missions with it. the graphics is good, but you need a very powerful pc to play it with high settings. the fps is showing when you do the changes so you dont have to exit the menu to test it. a joystick is recommended for flying the planes and helicopters. the game have a good variety of weapons, equipment and vehicles. the ballistics add a touch of realism.",184.4

"ok, this game is a huge upgrade from arma 2, graphics were inhanced, gameplay was made better, when talking to teammates the guy doesnt sound like a robot anymore(especially when accouncing grid locations) and overall its just waaaaaaaay better . but, theres one thing that bothers me, the explosions. in arma 2 the explosions were majestic, they had vibrant colours and the colours were sharp. i used to place a tank and then make a jet destroy the tank just so i could see the explosion, or i would fly in a helicopter and shoot rockets, but in arma 3 the explosions look so unpowerful and the colour is dull, theres nothing going on, it doesnt feel or look like a real explosion(apart from the debris flying). arma 2s explosions looked alot better. that for me is the only down-side, the ai was also improved alot.",88.3
"havent really played the single player but a bit and it seems good. multiplayer is very fun like arma 2. arma 3 is a good sequel to arma 2 and i dont know why people say it lags a lot, maybe because they dont have good pcs and the game has really good graphics. dont play the game if you like fast action movie gameplay like cod. cause this game is all about patience.i reccomend playing king of the hill in mp in the beginning because its one of better gamemodes!",66.6

"after several months of trying to use this game i have had enough. today the latest update removed all the mods in expansions (with no guidance about how to reinstall them) that made this half completed game playable. despite its huge potential and possibilities, bi have developed and sold a half completed game thats over complex, unintuitive, with poor; single play functions, gameplay and ai command & control, editing and character / vehicle modifications. despite excellent features (virtual arsenal and editor) they are not interconnected but isolated elements requiring complex and out of game processes to bring them together! when was this acceptable? for some reason its set in 2030 (why?) and relies far to heavily on the modding community to make up for its fundamental weaknesses (e.g. bipods for lmg and snipers rifles are an urgent requirement you can not use the weapons effectively (or realistically). but no bohemia interactive priorities go carts over critical game weakness to be addressed, waiting 2 years to have this addressed in the dlc stream, can i ask how i get my money back please?",143.2

(every new feature will be available for everyone. while you cannot drive certain vehicles, you will be able to ride them as passenger. and when there will be new features like the ability to slingload cargo, you can do it as well without paying for the dlc.) - the game doesnt run that well, even on the highest-end machines you most likely wont get more than around 50 fps. - there arent that much servers, gamemodes like altis life seem to have taken over the server list, resulting in a low amount of co-op missions. so expect to bring friends to this if you would like to play missions online. - the games performance is heavily decided by the server. if the server laggs you will not only get lagg, but a low framerate as well. here are some final ratings as well: gameplay / fun = 9/10 replayability = 10/10 performance = 6/10 dlc = 8/10 servers = 5/10",170.6

"arma 3 is an excellent game for 2 reasons. number one, its engaging and immersive and fun, and number two is the fact that bohemia interactive cares about its modding community (hence the competition make arma, not war). but arma 3 comes with a few flaws. chief among these, in my opinion, is optimization as i own a very good mid-level pc and i seem to be getting around 16 to 20fps. also is the lack of vehicles and weaponry, although i know that is set to change, i would have liked the game to be complete and not an about to finish up beta. but if you have some friends that are interested, then why dont you visit the islands of altis and stratis. live a new life in altis or stratis life, fight for survival in wasteland, or work together to defeat opfor ai in invade and annex. just bare in mind that this is a military simulator, so no run and gun or rendezooks here, just good ol fashioned tactical warfare.",436.7

"dear bohemia you guys made a nice game, yes. the cons are easily noticable, starting witrh the beta ready engine, (we all know this but still love it) the fact that youre money farming people for helos dlcs and seeing if it works. the fact you pander more for the life community side this time than the core fans. but hey, you take what you can get. its still a good game if you can find a good unit to play with, and mods. games legit worth is about $39,99 usd without the modding community. i recommend this if you are someone who has a vast majority of free time playing army barbie or just a kissless virgin who never touched a woman and spends it playing out a simulation of a real life. if youre a core fan. dont bother 90% of core servers are hosted on 4gb of ram",702.3
"this game is awsome, if you are looking for a military based game that is as real as a game can get, then this game has your name writen all over it. you need communication, team work, and strategy to win, lone wolfing it or running guns blazin will fail like there is no tomorrow!",30.5

"if i got stuck with one game only in my library it is this. the possibilities it offers and the community that support it make it a winner. that said it has its issues. needs a strong cpu and decent to perform very well, going against the rule of thumb in modern pc gaming. additonally there are lots of bugs and issues that still need address. unfortunately a lot of them have existed in previous titles too. there is positive development progress all the time though. arma 3 aims for and achieves something which no other game does.",562.3
"arma 3 is a masterpiece that i think will be played for a a long time! this game has beautiful graphics of terrain and objects. gameplay mechanics are quite easy to learn but becoming a master takes time and practice, you maybe able to kill from 100 meters but you will have to train to kill at 1000. there are a wide selection of weapons and clothing for your charicter, ranging from ghille suits to civillian clothing. where i think this game shines is the scale of combat, with two absolutly huge maps and combat scenarios arma will never give you the same scenario twice! this isnt any arcade shooter, arma is a tactical shooter, some would even call it a role-playing game! summary: buy this game if you have a moderatly powerfull pc!",113.8

"this military sandbox is definitely worth the buy! some game-modes i like are: king of the hill: a great team vs. team vs. team game-mode where you fight to stay in the objective area, level up to unlock more weapons, vehicles, and more! role-play game-mode (altis life, stratis life, arma 3 life, arma rpg) : a really fun mode where you can live your life as a civilian and choose a career, apple farming is good but you will make a bit more mooney running drugs. this game-mode offers great role-play experience that cant be beat. epoch mod: a great pvp/survival mod very similar to dayz, in this mod you can build your team, craft a base, fight off enemy ai, kill zombies, survive, scavenge. a great mod to play if you are a fan of dayz standalone, arma 2 epoch. overall a great game, and with 700 hours played i can highly suggest this game to anyone.",886.7
"i give this a thumbs down, not becaue its a war simulator and im looking for another cod, but because its so glitchy, that every time i feel like im starting to be immersed in the game, it knockes me back out. i use the binos to see where enemy troops are and it just decides that i have selected another item and pulls that out. i change from my rifle to my pistol and it changes back by itself 10 seconds later. it just loses all feel to it, and when it happens and it gets you killed it just makes you think it not worth it. i wouldnt buy till they can iron out these issues. on the posive side the actual game would have good potential without that issue.",8.6

"a fantastic game with great multiplayer and the best mission editor ive ever played with. this game almost does arma 2 justice, it includes some great graphics options (picture-in-picture, post-processing effects, draw-distance) which allows it to run on some pretty low-end computers (im running it on near max with a 6670! (all on high/ultra with a view-distance of 3.5km)) the campaign is a vast improvement over arma 2s campaign including proper voice acting, realistic plot and some nice comedy hidden around the map. id rate this game 8/10 > great campaign > fantastic editor < quite buggy (none which are game breaking) > fantastic modding community < lack of units/ a lot of reused assets",709.7

"what can i say? this is arma 3. perfect in every sense. best thing about arma games are their mods. altis life, breaking point, king of the hill, battle royale..etc. you name the kind of gameplay you want and it is available out there. the bonus is that this game is optimized properly as opposed to arma 2. the new engine in arma 3 makes the graphics look real. definietly recommend this.",126.0

"i will quote a good friend of mine; steam winter sale ftw. arma is 50% off again - which makes it priced about right given the ery required to make it work all snazzy. best arma review ever. if you can run the gauntlet, this game is brilliant. if you expect to download something, and have it work, best wait awhile.",81.0

"i do enjoy the arma series, mainly because of dayz and this is a great game so if you also love arma definitely play this. firstly i must say this is a huge step up from arma 2, everything looks a lot nicer and plays a lot nicer. but as with arma 2 i still find the gameplay a bit clunky, especially the movement, i know this is supposed to be on the realism side of the fps genre but its a little too realistic for my liking to the point of it loosing some of its enjoyment. everything feels so slow and again, clunky i just dont like how it plays. but again, a fantastic shooter and if you love arma or tactical fps games then yes you must buy this, wasteland and altis life are always fun.",12.8
"take a few friends and play wasteland mode if you want awesomeness !",10.6
"multiplayer 8/10 - its really great; loads of features, replayablility etc. could do with some new weapons, but for now the multiplayer works very well. single player - 2/10 - it sucks. utterly. you die all the time, ai have laser accuracy and x-ray vision, you fail missions for no reason, i.e. the uav section on death valley - there is no indication of what to do or where to look in this segment, and you have a 2min timer on it. its pointless. overall, in my experience the campaign - even on recruit - is frustrating and a complete waste of time. dont bother. four frustrating hours to complete the first 3 missions with over 40 mission fails (mostly due to deaths) is pointless.",85.1
"extremely fun and addicting game with all the various mods and game matches u can play, its never ending with the creativity the community has and as the game has great editing and coding that u can do to match what u want to incorporate into the game its just great fun as all players come and give in feedback and play the game :) recommend for anyone, worth the buck.",104.4

"flying a heli in just your underwear is a great experience.. awsome visuals, cool experience",367.2
"excellant combat simulator. this is not a cod/bf type game, it is a simulator of real life combat operations, you can die from one round etc. if you want as close to a real war experience as possible without real bullets flying at you this is your game. perform as infantry, helo pilots, fixed wing pilots, tank crewmembers etc and work with your squad to achieve victory. very well done game, lots of mods and community content, definitely worth the money.",12.1
"life-like graphics and immersion would give any veteran ptsd. this game will turn anyone into a adrenaline junky instantly. the realistic gameplay and balistics are punishing, but at the same time very rewarding. this third installment of bohemias army simulator set in the near future on an existing island offers tactical gameplay and is enjoyed best playing in a squad. although lone wolfing can be done your survival chances will be smaller. the base game includes access to multiplayer mods like battle royal, wastelands, king of the hill, altis life and breaking point. high replayability value and a mission editor for those who like scripting all makes arma3 worth your money. requires a mid-high end pc to run properly. the gameplay can be slow. some mods dont run as well as others and suffer from desync. it has a few bugs and glitches, though nothing game breaking ive experienced so far. the movement can feel clunky and the controls/keybindings may take a while getting used to as there are just so many. i would reccomend arma3 to anyone who enjoys a serious militairy simulator.",89.9
"if say you like call of duty, straight into some action, then probably not the game for you, however, forget this games campaign and clunky  controls and go to the multiplayer, give say an invade and annex server a try, trust me, if you are to just follow a group of players, you are bound to have some of the best moments in your gaming life so far.",264.7

"whilst being a unique and ambitious game with unparalleled scope and detail, the overly complicated bindings and game-mechanics and lack of any meaningful tutorials for the more complex systems often result in frustration. this game is known for its mod-ability, and whilst this is a blessing given the clunky unpolished state of much of the core mechanics, the number of community mods/ variations of gameplay modes adds to the confusion and inaccessibility of the multiplayer game. the poor optimization also leads to performance issues in multiplayer regardless of system specs. in summary- i want to love this game but its too demanding on my time and patience. this game is for the hard core milsim fan only.",73.2
"very interesting choice, i love it, this is my favorite multiplayer game. i play in a milsim unit and have led them before too. it is best with a group of people; seeing as it is a military simulator this would make sense. i enjoy it very much and my favorite role is to be a pilot. if you are a casual then you can play on vannilla and there are plenty of those. if you are into a little more of a challenge than you may want to go in to tactical realism or milsim. it is very fun but can be demanding on your computer, also it has a few glitches and may seem expensive. the choice is up to you. odds are that you probably would have already gotten the idea of what the game is like from the preview. this is one of those games where if you are interested you will probably like it, but dont pass it down if you are curious. -message me if you wanting to join a milsim unit. have fun! worth the price!",691.5

"well where should i start... i never played any arma title until now. arma3 as the main game got a great storyline. for the multiplayer, well i bought it just for altis life - mod :d but this mod is awesome! altis life is an role playing mod with standart rp rules (on the most servers). you can chose to be a normal guy, farming salt, gold, diamonds or go fishing, selling the stuff for better equipment, cars or helicopters. or.. you can farm cannabis, cocain and heroin. become a rebel and fight the police and the system. steal money from the good people and so on. every cop inside the game is a real player! you chose !",131.5

"so i got this game and wont even let me install it or show in my library but to my friends it says i have it wtf.....",0.5
"a great military sim that keeps you engaged both in its story and its warfare. its a perfect slow and fast paced game and allows for multiple playable areas whether you are deploying and picking up troops, running a covert mission with your nightvision, traveling by sea to support ground troops, or fighting on the ground in armor such as tanks or battling on foot. it includes even more areas of battle such as close air support (cas) to diving underwater and traveling off shore to the area of opperation (ao). i highly recomend this game to anybody looking for a fun first or third person shooter that is very flexable with its battle.",833.0
"very nice game i played arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrowhead and they have step it up really nicely the multiplayer server engines could be a bit better but apart from that its a masterpiece of fps games.",857.7
"great game, well worth the money i paid for it. i would recommend this game to every one of my friends...",909.2
"if you are into military scenarios, this game is great for you. with the new engine and actual physics aspects, it takes a big leap forward for the arma series. for me, it has been an amazing trip from alpha into the upcoming release, an was not in any way a dissapointment. i cant wait for jets :d",157.4
"you either love it and dont let if go or you hate it. there are two types of people... those who love arma and those who dont. if you love military stuff, simulations and have a large , you will love this simulation. youhave to look past the frequent bugs and unfinished features and venture into the vast open world, endless possibilities and sandbox gameplay in order to enjoy this fully. and then you open the multiplayer and the modding community comes in and you will loose your life to this game.",84.9
"very good game just need to fix bugs i recommend it to all",55.2
"if youre looking for a good time go into a game, of people trying to talk like real life military radio operators. its hilarious. 11/10",154.7
"i am plagiarizing the insightful observation of another by writing this, but arma 3 is best thought of as a fairly robust combined arms simulation engine. fun or gameplay arent found in arma itself-- one has to rely largely on community-produced content (scenarios, scripts, custom assets, etc.) in order to have a good time. the ultimate strength and weakness of arma is that the experience you can have is almost completely dependent on how much effort you want to put into building (or discovering) that experience.",129.0

"pros: arma 3 is a realilistic game with really good graphics and massaive maps that give the player the ability to decide how they are going to apporach their enemy. the multiplayer is really fun and their a ton of servers aswell, also modding is fun and easy with arma 3 and it comes with its own mission editor too. cons: the game is really difficult to play and will take anyone some time to get use to. arma 3 has a ton of controls that the player has to learn and commanding a squad in some missions can become a nightmare when your a.i. team mates decide to either not shoot at the enemy even after telling to open fire or running in front of something you told them to hide behind and getting shoot. i would recommend arma 3 for its realistic experence that i have only found in the arma series. you should check out arma 2 and day z standalone too.",284.4

"yeah  this game. buggy as  and increasingly so with every god damn update they release.",107.8
"this game is epic. huge step up from arma 2. it still does have a lot of flaws but overall it is a much smoother game. however, low-end pcs beware. i am running an fx-6300 and a r9 280x and i consider it to be a pretty decent system. i can run most new games on near-max settings however this game on medium settings is giving me around 20fps. im not sure if its just very poorly optimized or what but it is sloooow.",30.3

"amazingly fun, amazingly hard. this is for real, folks. forget about running and gunning. forget about killing soldiers who see you first. youre dead. annoying? yes. but so much fun, still! i love the feel to the game. the graphics are amazing, and its incredibly immersive. especially coupled with a good head tracking system like the trackir!",70.0

"fantastic game with a lot of mods. the best military simulator i have played, you should get it if you have the money. the arma 3 life mod actually reminds me of gta v but a lot of more role play in it. i recommend this game 10/10.",117.2

"a great game, and great break away from the aa mainstream games like cod and battlefield",6.3
"everything about this game improves on arma ii except for one key point. the game simply does not run. not on high end machines, not on anything, it is so poorly optimised and coded that no system can run it smoothly (60 fps). online games lag all the way down to 10-15 fps in cities just because the server code is poorly written and results in server side lag that effects frame rate as well as hit detection. if this game was actually able to run at a decent frame rate that stayed decent online it would be a wonderful game. until that time i cannot recommend this game.",24.7
"arma iii a game of many things, this will be one of my personal favorites. the game is set on two islands based in the aegean sea, altis a large real life island (limnos in real life) and stratis a small satallite island (agios efstratios in real life). the setting is great with largley mixed enviroments ranging from beutifully desgined housing complexes, dry salt lakes and pine forests this really puts a great game world in perspective. combat is intense and quick paced, forcing you to make split second desicions like do i take out machine gunner who is pinning down our squad or do i kill the rpg trooper before he destroys the tank. this puts some inexpirienced gamers to the test and even the pro can still be the noob. there are many things wrong with arma iii, one of which is it has a feeling of lack of completion to it like it claims to have a wopping 40 wepons when arma 2 had about 60+. the game is buggy and contains many performance issues. the game has only been released for a few months but has gone through alpha and beta phases so the game is not up to scratch as it could be. i would recommend this game to anyone looking for great communitys and someone who is looking for something new.",106.4

"this is a beautifully detailed military simulation, but sadly quite a poor computer game. it demands a very powerful pc to run well, and it is not at all friendly to new players. there also doesnt seem to much hand crafted content besides the huge sandbox they created. for example, i remember playing several fun missions in the original operation flashpoint with my friends, but when i tried to play co-op with a friend in this new game, there was very little to choose from and some missions were very confusing.",6.0

"about the singleplayer , it comes as a combat simulation mainly simulating various combat situations. now the game is more about the multiplayer. the multiplayer can be scripted which means you can have every mod you want. there are roleplay mods , king of the hill , deathmatch and so on. i would clearly recommend buying the game.",2.2
"arma 3 was awesome and good but sometimes lag in some places or situation.",5.5
"arma 3 is a realistic military shooter that is part of the arma series (is it really?). the arma series has been around since 2001 and since then it has been improved greatly. arma 3 is a great game for people that are looking for a milsim (military simulation) game that has all aspects of war/military such as air (helicopter, jet, uav), infantry, armour (tank, aa, etc), water (boats, submarine). the arma series is known for having a really strong modding community, this is thanks to the support and the encouragment from the developers of the game. there arent really many problems with this game and the few problems that it does have dont really affect gameplay and if a bug is found the community generally makes it know really quickly helping the developers find the problem and fix it really quickly. with all the bugs getting fixed so quickly and the problems with the game being so small this leaves a great amount of time for the developers to add more to the game making it greater. overall this game is really fun and really intresting and you cant really run out of things to do with all the mods that are made for the game (epoch, a3 life and more). the arma series is also the origination of the dayz game.",195.0
"loved it, after the success of cooking mama and league of legends the developer activision shines down on us with the masterpiece that is this game (gears of halo thef auto 5) and with its staggering 69 dlc packs all priced at $4.20 youd be a fool not to try this game out. insomniac games really outdid themselves on this one. 8/6 would eat without package.",388.8

"its arma and thats what ruins this game. well ruin might be a strong word actually but thats not the point. the point is; whilst arma 3 is an enjoyable exeperience with its fancy guns and new physics, it really doesnt do anything to improve upon arma 2. i mean, theres plenty of new content and nice new graphics but it doesnt feel like much of an improvement in the way the game works. while i dont mind the action menu system i can see how it could be considered counter intuitive and that is the problem. the game has a learning curve that can make it difficult to enjoy and while i dont like games being dumbed down, i do enjoy them being made more accessible. the system used in arma is what puts a lot of players off and i dont think its particularly justifiable, as soon as bohemia change this they will see an increase in the playerbase. after that messy blab about the games system i do want to say i still wholeheartedly recommend the game, its great fun and worth a play.",16.3
"the best war simulator i ever played! worth to buy.",53.9
"a real game for real people. the harsh learning curves are overwelmed by the rewards of a perfect assult or a mission that gos well. buy this game. learn how it works as is not like the standard fps out there at the moment. id also recomend arma 3 life. a muiltplay server that is just tops when played witht he right people.",484.1

"arma 3 - the game operation flashpoint tried to be on the consoles... this however, is a whole sifferent story. it is tough to start with but persevere and what you are presented with is a hard working, rewarding experience that only pc gaming can provide. if and when you finish the content the game is packaged with, you can then turn to the steam workshop and pick up hand crafted missions to keep you going for probably forever. to be honest this makes it look like cod and battlefield are aimed at the pre 15 year old market... ready to play something sensible and realistic? buy and play arma 3.",46.3
"arma 3 offers you multiple sandbox multiplayer missions and variety of large scale battle scenarios. bullet travel and weapon ballistics are quite reallistic so its not your standart battlefield game. big maps and large game modding community make this game really specia. 11/10 would play.",532.9

"arma 3 is a good composed game. i couldnt stop playing since it merges you into a intense war atmosphere. it was cool getting into a car with a bunch of people and riding to kill an enemy group on altis life rpg (one of the many cool gamemodes). some things that you will need to get used to is walking and not seeing action for a while (which make those fights 10 times better). but if you want a zombie survival type of gamemode do epoch (which is pretty fun). also another gamemode is sandbox, which you go into a world with a bunch of people and test and monkeying around with the vechiles and guns (helps you get used to the gun physics). arma 3 is a good for 59.99$ when it includes 4 different gamemodes. also would like to state this game wont be like any other shooter you will ever play hope you think my review was helpful.

"arma 3 so when i saw this game for the first time, i thought that soon will release another excellent piece arma. however, the first disappointment was already in anticipation, as the extremely small amount of technology and absence campaign. but this disappointment disappeared when issuing the first chapter of the campaign was excellent and the new technique also appeared. but i will not criticize. i must say that the guys from bohemians are struggling and working hard to repair, etc. graphically its a big shift but a new engine this could offer more. the playing area is huge and real and opens new possibilities for mods. technical equipment and weapon was terrible at the beginning and the newly added equipment was broken but gradually improves and fixes. despite this, however, it is compared arma i and ii, step backward. personally, i think that would bohemia interactive could use a better future. on the other hand, however, the campaign is excellent, what more can i say. final verdict: arma iii is an improved forward, but it is incredibly untapped potential. if it bohemia interactive put in the time and dedicated technicians and armor, or even a new engine, so it would be something completely different, much better. 8/10",180.0
"besides the fact your enemies turn into slender man everytime you shoot them, this game is by far best arma besides combat operations and arma 2 but graphics do matter cause in low settings on arma 3 is like medium on arma 2. also this game is very futuristic in a way the csat are the closest thing to the modern day terrorists and the aaf are your greek resistance the only modern thing in this game is nato they use commanche helis, mraps, ghost hawks, and who ever is wondering whats a ghost hawk? it was the prototype heli used to transport the navy seals to kill osama. finally the game modes are crazy fun like escape from stratis and they have steam workshop so you can download missions instead of making one your self they also have pvp but due to desync it wont be as fun as playing coop with friends. the campaign in this isnt like the one from previous armas its more dynamic it tells the story of how nato is being attacked by aaf and the csat i wont spoil anything because this is a review not the campaign",597.9

"there is so much content to enjoy in arma 3-from cooperative missions to battle royale to wasteland. i guarantee youll be spending hours playing through it all. the experience becomes even better if you have friends to play with. even though the single player isnt very enjoyable, its a huge leap from that of arma 2. if you can catch arma 3 on sale, i definitely recommend you buy it.",182.3

"this is a bad game because of people have that white-list and you can not be a police man on atlis life, medic this is also pots me and my friends off this game and it is also not a fun game with other people and friend because of the spown sports.",29.6
"i love everything about the game from flying to the gamemodes theres just so many hours in this game that its totaly worth it becuase theres nods o plenty and its just fun to play with or without friends",220.0
"really enjoy this game. dont really play it much, but i still recommend it.",1.3
"a vast improvement over arma 2, well worth the time to try it out for yourself.",42.3

"good for altis life, little else to say thats good.",4.7
"there is really no way of explaining this game to anyone who hasnt played it. its awesome. its fun. its total freedom. its a community. its dedication. its tons of bugs and glitches. its the thing you want to do with your friends on a friday night. its blowing  up, cruising with technicals and flying in helos. its at the same time realism and make-believe. its frustratingly hard at times. its long intervals of doing nothing. its modding, modding and more modding. its fps drops. its only limited by your imagination. its even more awesomeness. hell, enough talk! buy the the godd*mn game!",459.6
"good game but not worth 40.00, id say wait for sale before buying, need good pc to run at decent fps and keep the game looking not",17.1
"this game offers a lot. and i mean a lot. you can download endless missions made from the community workshop and play with strategy with your friends or run around half naked and dance around. or you could roleplay and buy an atm from all the drug money you earned in altis life. or have races with friends in karts. this game is an army simulator, but its great for modding which lets you do more things. now, this game isnt something like cod or battlefield, it takes strategy and tactics and patience. if you come from these games it will be harder to get into fast. although if you play through the campaign it will help you get used to the game. please dont think the warfare in this game is just pew pew pew, die, respawn, repeat. it takes skill. altis is a very big map, you can drive around for what seems like forever in this beautiful map. there is forestry, a lot of ocean, desert, grassland, etc. there is also stratis, a smaller, more wastelandish and deserty than altis. you need a good pc to run this game. i usually get around 45 fps on online servers, around 60 on single player or games with small amounts of people in it. overall, this game has a ton of things to do and you cant get bored of it. i give it a 9.5/10",775.6
"a solid upgrade from its predecessor (arma 2), the new movement system is outstanding and a really great edition to the game, the new engine really brings the maps to life, espically at night time, more enterable buildings then ever before makes for better gameplay and more care taken when clearing towns/buildings, once the mods that made a2 so great come across and get upgraded this game will be complete, bis add a bipod for christ sake!",304.1
"thanks arma 3 for teaching me about the metric system.",209.3
"amazing game! the life mod also changed and bringed a lot of rpg + rp lovers to buy this game.",358.7
"a game in which almost always when you die it is the games fault. broken  piece of  in which you have to scroll through menus to do  which is very convenient when in the middle of a firefight, almost revolutionary id say. a simulator where the cars explode(!) when you crash it into anything. this is a game made by devs who have never played any modern games and take all their inspiration from their own past games and the only one that they made that was considered modern was the original operation flashpoint back in 1998 or something. all their games past that have imitated that game and arma 3 design is still based on that game (read: doesnt work very well anymore, or never really did) if it still isnt very obvious this is a rage post. ive played the game for over 100 hours for some reason and i continue to play it but im still convinced that 10 hours in bohemias office and i could fix the design of this game.",129.3

"im glad i could play arma 3 for free on this last weekend, thus preventing me from buying it, ever. every game should give buyers this option, to try before buying. while arma 3 may be a good game, im sure now that its not for me. i have been playing bf for a long time, even bf4 now, and i think bf spoiled me. i really tried enjoying arma 3, but i couldnt. in my humble opinion: bad graphics, bad optimization, bad performance, bad gameplay, bad controls, bad hud, bad voip, bad campaign and bad multiplayer. ive spent nearly one hour on multiplayer driving a truck around the map, trying to figure what to do, how to get a weapon and where were my team mates. before that i tried campaign, with no satisfaction either. its is an expensive game. im really glad i didnt bought it.",1.7
"game is great....very tactial would recommend.....but mp has low fps at the moment",152.8

"all i have to say this is still a work in progress game in the way of content with little content to begin with but still a great game and about two years down the road this will be a great game.",805.3
"pretty much the best game ive ever played. looks like youre playing in a picture, and tactics is a really big part. gets a 100x more fun with some mates. a lot of different gamemodes, and oh the possibilities with all the different mods! now you can also fire from choppers and ground vehicles with the new update. so gather some friends, buy the game, hop on a server, and get some simply epic experiences.",815.8

"having been a counter-strike player for many years and loving it, i stumbled across an arma 2 video on youtube and was engrossed, i watched a few of them and the total difference between cs and arma was obvious to me, arma brought realism which is what i was missing from counter strike, so i checked the steam store for prices and noticed that arma 3 was due for release, so i hung fire and awaited the first arma 3 videos and knew that it was the game that i wanted. well! arma 3 is now owned and its as rock solid as any shooter ive owned with one exception, arma 3 actually makes me feel as though im in the actual game, i feel like a real soldier with a real mission, long gone are the days where i just run around a small map blasting anyone who gets in my way or dying and respawning, arma 3 is tactical, you have to think about every move you make because if you run around like an idiot, then you die like an idiot, arma 3 is starting to define me as a player and my goal...... is to stay alive and fight another day. arma 3 gets a rock solid 10/10 from me.",226.2
"one of the best games i have ever played, it supports mods (jsrs 2.1 and blastcorea3 are absolute must haves), always fun to play, huge maps (largest one has a terrain of 270*270 km without the water because its endless as far as i know), fluid animations, realistic ai (you cant just go on a stroll through an enemy bas (*ahem* call off duty)), and so on. i recommand it to anyone who wants to try something else, is a fan of realism or just wants to mess around and explode everything with the mission editor.",267.4
"for those who have played arma series, are passionate with military sims or are enjoying the lengthy(but worthwhile) process of winning, this is the game id recommend. although flight is not as good as the dcs, arma is a well-made simulator(thats right, it is not an arcade game)that simulates all sorts of experiences soldiers do during their line of duty. even if you dont mind your incompetent ai partners/subordinates, sp can be daunting; ai foes are definitely, even ridiculously, smart so you can be shot dead even if you make every precautions to prevent.(too bad our partners are not as smart). every variables must be accounted for executing a simple task. for those who just wanna play this game in a casual way, id really like to remind you this: you cannot be rambo, master chief, or cods protagonist or whatsoever to be winners, in arma. you are much more vulnerable than any of those mentioned heroes. you are in a virtual battlefield, you cannot beat foes unless they are really incompetent, un-coordinated bunches. regardlessly, for those who really want to experience what being a soldier feels like, id recommend this game. life is never easy, neither is this game.",43.8
"amazing game the createors realy out did thereselfs this time. and there is something for evryone there is many many different type of gamemodes.",331.1
"i love hand cuffing people and making them bow down and kiss my feet.",1.0
"amazing game..just started playing seriously about a month ago. replaces battlefield and what is call of duty?",806.1
"i got this for $20 with early access and it was definitely worth the money. if youre looking for a military simulator, youve probably already heard of arma, the best military simulator out there for the public. if youre looking for something more realistic than battlefield or even insurgency, this is what youre looking for. thanks to the new helicopter flight update, its essentially/almost a flight simulator as well, as they took parts of their actual flight simulator game engine and put them into arma 3. i dont know if i could say i would recommend purchasing it for $60, but for half off, id go for it.",168.0
"arma 3 is a fun game to play with your friends and offline. the offline story is very god and its always action. if you thinking of buying it i just say do it! its worth it! but 1thing dont stop playing it in the beginig couse its hard, just restart and try a new tactic! ///sry for the not so good english///:) buy it!",80.1
"an unbelievable step forward in nearly every respect within an already great series. graphically sublime with most improvements focusing on animation and gameplay fluidity. steam workshop has made the world of modding and mission making bigger and more accessible than ever before. a triumph.",359.8
"most fun game that uses realistic game features, tho not everything is ultra realistic you will still love this game 10/10",355.3
"great game! has everything from guerilla warfare to aerial combat, i spent atleast 3 hours just flying around on altis. extremely fun! pros and cons: +amazing graphics +superb gameplay +large portion of different types of gameplay and playstyles +realistic combat +workshop & moddable -slight performance issues, seems unfinished -could use more weapons and vehicles",49.5
"an epic, realistic army simulator! this game is incredibly amazing and stunning as you are playing a role in the army. unlike any other shooter/army games, arma manage to give the player a open-world battlefield. the map is very big, there are a massive range of weapons, outfits, vehicles, helicopters, boats and planes. problems: if you are thinking about buying this game, please be careful, when i bought the game, it shocked me when the game ran at 10 fps at low settings, i had to buy a complete new graphics card in order for it to at least run above 40 fps in medium/high settings.",348.8
"there is just no other game like the arma series and arma 3 has bought hte graphics bang up to date along with a host of new features. this is far too msall a box to start going into all arma 3 can offer you. it is well worth the money and has a rich modding community. a must own.",302.9
"ing rip off its says you need 4gb ram and i have that and when i play this game online i get ing worst fps ever dont buy",61.9
"you only buy arma 3 for the mods. the rest of the game and missions are lacking allot! but if you like altis life and other mods, then this is the game for you. but the net-code is just as bad or worse then bf4 so keep that in mind. but this is not a dice/ea game so you should buy it and teach ea a lesson!",254.0
"if you enjoy playing battlefield and are looking for a good military game then this is for you. the only limitation is what you can imagine, as most things have been made by the amaxing modding community, and if you dont want to make your own missions then either play the best arma campaign ever! or just download one from the community.",247.8
"very fun game. some aspects like jumping and crouching even the (double zooming) is quite annoying. but the game is very fun when played with a friend or two. can recommend.",313.7
"awesome war simulator game! way better than arma 2 and the storyline is more flowing and interesting! you must get it!",77.7
"war is hell. this game is so real its scary. 12/10 #swag",148.5
"best looking game of the year so far, not to mention great gameplay",75.6
"i dont have much of a game time in this game yet, but from what ive played and from what ive seen... its by far one of the best games i have played, its a massive open world army simulation kind of game, youre not being given anything like the enemy being highlighted ect, you have to use your eyes and ears and watch your every step... 8/10 maybe a couple of improvements can be made, but its deffo one of the best games i have played and id reccomend it to anyone with a bit of patience as its not as fast paced like games such as call of duty ect",1.3
"a huge step from its predecessor, arma iii offers the ultimate war simulation of our current time. the graphics will blow you away and with stellar combat driven gameplay powered by bohemia interactives latest engine real virtuality 4 the animation are as smooth as it gets. with the largest map of any video game ever made, altis, gives you plenty of new open ground to conquer and new combat adventures and missions to explore. a variety of weapon attachments and vehicles to drive will be made available, with new things being added monthly, you cant go wrong with what is being called the greatest war simulation money can buy.",248.1

"most realistic action,shooter,strategy game of all times",995.6
"ill be honest with you. i did complain a lot when this game came out, especially since i was used to playing bohemia interactives other games (arma, arma ii, ofp & addons). but after its birth pangs, arma iii really panned out as an incredible game. better graphics, incredible editor, and countless of tidbits that make this game as real as it can get as a combat simulator. and it has a healthy addon community that allows you to add everything from different camo & armor, to other vehicles, single player missions, campaigns, etc. with this passionate community, you want to brilliantly recreate conflicts ranging from the vietnam war to the current conflict between kurds and the islamic state. if you are really into modern warfare and every detail of it (logistics, recon, full-spectrum dominance, etc.) then get this game.",255.6
"great game!altis life and wasteland are by far the funnnest",336.6

"this game is awsome, if you are looking for a military based game that is as real as a game can get, then this game has your name writen all over it. you need communication, team work, and strategy to win, lone wolfing it or running guns blazin will fail like there is no tomorrow!",30.5
"i really like this game its the funniest game ever, i tried it on a free weekend. i want it so much but i have no money for it :( and i strongly reccomend this game :)",179.7
"great looking game altho it has probably the worst control setup of shooter i have played. after 30 minutes of trying to figure out how to walk and turn trying different key configurations i gave up.",0.9
"very good and impressive, especially for me, im a not easily pleased when it comes to video games i would reccomend this to all my friends it made a big jump from arma ii",35.5
"arma 3 is obviously a better arma 2, in many ways. many positives to the game. one of which is the addition of the steam workshop. to download missions for co-op and singleplayer. theres no hastle of going to",34.2
"although this game does have its qwerks, like other arma games, the large scale and extensive detail in graphics makes up for it. the game offers endless fun and although is better with friends, you can make friends who play arma 3 all the time very easily. would recommend for anyone interested",114.1
"very good and impressive, especially for me, im a not easily pleased when it comes to video games i would reccomend this to all my friends it made a big jump from arma ii",35.5
"my hours on record should speak for the game itself, its only in beta and already is such a fun game, sure the ai are a little buggy but wasteland, coop, hell even just playing helicopter tag is fun. its a sandbox game so you can spawn in stuff in the editor and create a mission and then play it however you want to. one of the greats of our generation going beyond anything call of duty, battle field, halo have done or probably will do i highly recommend this game.",345.8
"bought it for the advanced military simulation aspects. it was fun for 1 hour in single player it was fun for 10 hours in multiplayer then it was like meh kept playing for the massivly moddable and diverse multiplayer. in particular altis life!!",211.6
"a difficult game with a bit of a learning curve with all the controls. fun, but multiplayer can be a pain in the  on the rpg servers. to many kids and people who dont care/cant speak english. sort of disapointed where my money was spent yet again. feeling disapointed with fpss as of recently.",139.0

"lots of different game modes to keep you busy. its all about that wasteland mod though",52.4
"its a great game but i think that we shouldnt pay for dlc that should have been a update... because lets be honest there hasnt been much change since alpha...",268.3
"this game has a lot of available game modes because of how many mods (mission files) people make. this game is diverse because of the modding community that the arma series has. while the game still needs more firearms to be implemented into it, i am sure the modding community will fix that issue. this game has been out for a couple years now and is doing strong. arma 2 had a strong following and i do hope that this will too. one downfall about this game that has been around since the alpha is that usb headsets are hit and miss. sometimes they have certain sounds cut out. the way i went around this issue is by selecting my optical out as my default instead of my usb headset (skullcandy plyr1). another downfall is the content. the game takes place the near future however the game does not include any current era firearms that are being used in any military force.",257.8
"my completely fair, non biased score 91/100 ive had some of the most funny, and awe inspiring times in this combat sim. (when everything clicks, and youve clued yourself up about the sim) it is beyond how good your imagination thinks it is.. by far the best money ive ever spent, on any piece of software in my life! my words of advice would be to learn it. reel back on your rambo insticts from kiddy shooters. to get the most out of this, its best to apply yourself. if you consider yourself good at cod or battlefield - prepare to have your trousers pulled down, and  firmly spanked by seasoned tactically minded players! why this only got 74/100 is beyond me. i think part of that could be people wrongly thinking theyll jump in and kick . then the reality of them not being very good afterall sets in.. they leave and review it down. either that or they experienced some glitches which were apparent on release. ive not experienced any problems recently, most major bugs are now in the past. i think the only thing that miffs me about this sim, is the scripting little toerags that rear their ugly heads from time to time on some online server. they are usually dispatched pretty quickly though. seriously, buy this.. if you dont youre missing out on a world of entertainment!",283.5
"with clunky mechanics, a joke of a tutorial and god-like ai, this game is a waste. unless you just want it for the severly limited amount of accesible servers playing one of many different styles of missions (altis life, altis life, altis life, or altis life) i would advise steering clear of this game.",5.0
"put simply, this is the only first person shooter that any self respecting gamer needs to buy. it has it all.",733.2

"one of the best war simulation games out there today! it truly is fun playing with friends and teaming up to search the huge maps!",70.6
"when i played arma 3 during the free weekend a few weeks ago, i enjoyed it a lot and i also like the graphics and the interface. it really fits in with the players. altis life rpg - definitely recommend it, go play it...",76.9

"despite my logged time, ive never played arma iii. all time is logged playing breaking point. it seems the more the devs improve the mod, the more it becomes pretty awful. worth playing anyway.",21.0
"game is awesome, there is so much to do especially with the modding community hard at work to add in anything and everything that the creators didnt already put into the game.",25.5
"simply amazing. fun to play insurgency and king of the hill",256.2
"would definitely recommend this game. this is a fantastic game, just as its predecessors were. a fair bit of content and tons of different game modes to play on, expect more to come in the future. the ai can really rip you apart in this one and arent as easily tricked like in arma 2. pick up the game, you wont regret it.",191.9
"the game is a beautiful piece of art many times the size of the skyrim province. arma 3 has a few genres incorporated for our entertainmentbut the two main are military simulator and flight simulator, personally, since finishing the campaign i have been playing the dead nation mod and im totally immersed. more so than skyrim. more so than any game ive played. its worth its money and even better if you get it when its on sale. if you cant wait then look around for a cheaper new sealed hard copy on amazon. its hard to be good at this game so bad losers beware :-)",209.9
"game is boring as  if you dont have friends.youll die repeatdly and just get frustrated,eventually realising you wasted 6 hours when you could play something good like dayz. dont buy unless you have friends. and a good pc i get 13fps and im fine but ive never played a game any higher so it goes to personal preferance.",157.3
"for the true infantry simulation experience the arma series for me is the only choice. ive been a player of these games since the release of the original operation flashpoint: cold war crisis back in june 2001. arma3 solidly builds on the pedigree built up by the previous games, retaining the essential feel of them whilst adding many new and much welcome features. the new highly customisable inventory is a great improvement allowing the adjustment of clothing, personal equipment and weapons and weapon accessories. some people may complain about the state of in game features like missions and the campaign at release but arma/ofp has always been more than just the game that was initially purchased to me. it is about what the game will become as bi and the modding community especially works its magic over the coming years. quite simply a pc classic which will hopefully continue to grow.",115.9
"one of the best games in my opinion , so much to do with all the mods and diffrent game modes. 10/10 to play with friends.",864.9
"very slow paced. controls are clunky. campaign makes absolutely no sense! if a game is not attractive enough to play for free, then its not something i would pay for ever",1.1
"the single player campaign, despite being released in episodes is one of the most immersive and exciting single player games i have played. a wide variety of missions, a storyline that that keeps you interested and obvioulsy great locations from both stratis and the huge island of altis too. if single player isnt your thing, then there is sure to be an infinite amount of co-op missions made by players and mods for the multiplayer as well that will always be entertaining. still doesnt cut it? learn to use the map editor and create your perfect scenario that you would like to play out in arma 3 either by yourself, with a mate of with all of your friends if you so desire. 9/10, definitely recommend! altis was very poorly optimised on release but it has improved a lot since then. even i can run it on medium/normal with a 560 ti and an i7 2600 at a respectable framerate in most cases. hope this helps! see you on the battlefield!",55.4
"runs like , just like arma 2. the arma series continues to be a game that has promise, and is actually good when it runs properly, but that isnt the case for a large portion of the player base. you think you have good hardware? are you confident the computer you just spent a lot of money on is able to handle this game? think again, perfomance seems to be completely random in this game. on one hand you have someone with a mediocre machine, runs the game fine, and on the other you have someone who spent a lot of time and money setting up his machine and he can barely run it. its a lottery, and the chances of winning are low. this isnt a review, its a warning. if you have ways to test the game on your machine before you buy it, do it! otherwise you might regret your purchuse.",23.7
"omg. when i need to rub one out, i play arma iii. seriously... i beat my meat like it owes me money while driving the vehicles. also, this is a good game.",288.7

"the dlc policy of todays game developers is the worst possible thing that might ever come. arma 3 has limited content, but guess what? if you pay extra, you get extra content. why sell full game once, when you can divide it into pieces and sell in parts? i do not recommend.",98.0
"its a pretty hard game at least if you havent played these before but when you get there its awesome! you will get the most of it when you play with a group of friends. since there is so many mods there will be something to play for everyone no matter what you like. definetly would recommend this to someone who likes realistic wargames.",87.2

"such a beautiful game, excellent realism and tactical combat, you truly feel immersed in a real war.... however arma 3 has major failings, firstly it is poorly optimised, runs on only a couple of threads, meaning the newer your pc, the slower the game will run. the review pc was a piledriver 4.5ghz 8-core amd with a 680gtx card, ultra high settings the game had the same frame rate as low settings - averaging between 18 - 30fps, which was jerky but playable, until you got somewhere where a tank rolled in behind us and started shoooting, then everyone there was down to 3fps. people say there pc runs fine, but half the people i know who play are barely able to move and shoot, until arma 3 is fixed and written properly to support modern hardward, you should not buy this game. the developers have never managed to fix arma 2, i hold little hope they will fix arma 3!",38.1

"vanilla arma 3 is alright, but ive found it to be better with mods from both the workshop and armaholic. ive got in total about 30 monds that run everytime i play. i do however dislike the fact that they went all futuristic with the guns (the mx series is based on the acr) leaving it up to the modding community to devolope mods that add in better guns :)",153.0

"this game is very good if you enjoy hardcore action. no other shooter will get your heart racing like this game! you feel like you are in the battle, because it is so real! this game is not friendly to newbs or people who arnt used to pc games. it is also not friendly to people who dont have patience. the action in this game is fantastic, yet hard to play. it is still in alpha, but it has alot of potential. it is a simulator, so dont go jumping in thinking its your adverage shooter. this is my favorite shooter of all time right next to bioshock infinite. if you are looking for hardcore, real world wars alongside your friends, than this is perfect for you! <3",162.1
"this game needs tons of work, and a new editor mode that allows you to make decently good maps that will catch an eye of a random player, but the updates are monthly just keep praying for better updates. also  all of the script hackers, you cant get banned from vac if your a script hacker in arma 3, its sad to see a half full server have to restart and still have te scriptor in the server after guesses who it is.",173.8

"after the great operation flashpoint (now arma: cold war assault) the first two armas where not that great, but still very good and i enjoyed playing them for a long time. arma 3 is my favourite part of the trilogy, thanks to a good and thrilling campaign (much better than cod or bf) and the arma formula, that perfectly works now. ai does what you want, their aim is very good and they are very helpful. enemy seeks cover and is a real threat, which makes the missions very thrilling. like in the first three rainbow six or the first ghost recon. the campaign feels very tense, like operation flashpoint or the addon resistance and i really enjoyed it. the game runs perfect on my two year old pc and it is sure beautiful. the sound is also very good and the rifles dont sound like toyguns which adds to the war atmosphere. voice acting is great too. the controls are a bit difficult to master at first if you havent played the other games of the series, but you get there with a little practice. the new item system is also very good and now you can quick and easy change weapons, put attachments on your rifle or grab some other gear. overall this game is one of my favourite games of all time and its a true masterpiece and thanks to the community you have tons of content for free. get it and enjoy it! :-)",33.5
"i have to say that this is one of the most entertaining games iv ever played, if youre in to a war simulator or a real life simulator then this is the game for you. this game has everything from picking peaches to making war plans. the most popular mod on this game is altis life which is a rpg mod where you have rules and cops etc. i would reccomend this game for the people who either loves trolling or loves being something they are not (real hardcore role players) 10/10",370.4

"though i have not palyed this for the longest time, i have always been a fan of the arma series. i actually really like what they did with their newest game. it still pertains the original arma feel, but there have been a few changes from arma 2 i do not like. for example, i played alot of the campaigne and i find it strang how they made it that you die after about 2 shots (one to the head, three to the limbs), yet when i shoot an npc in the torso, it takes about half a magazine. i remember in arma 2 that the npcs had the same damage system as you. also, i feel that the first aid kits are a little bit cheap. in arma 2 if you didnt have a medic in your squad, or you wernt near a medical tent, you were screwed if you got shot, you would either crawl your way home if you were shot in the legs or shoot like a lawn sprinkler if you got shot anywhere else. im not saying its a bad game, in fact its a very good game, but previous arma fans be warned, there will be some things that will possibly get under you skin.",32.5

"well, all that i can say about this game is that, with all the game breaking glitches, random deaths, wall glitching, and leg stretching glitches... this game is ing amazing! i love how when i shoot someone, they bounce and make it unrealistic, and the amazing bush wookie graphics. if people have  computers i can just sit in an open grass field and no one will ing know! bush wookies are amazing all in all and truly make this game. with out the bush wookie suits... this game is terrible... buy it now! murica  yeah!",219.4
"arma 3 is a fun game to play with friends if you dont have anyone to play with its not gunna be that fun but its a great game but only one thing i dont get why did they have to make the controlles so weird i mean why but besides that its a great game",16.9
"well, what can i say.. arma 3 is a one of a kind game. its a twist on the average, fast paced, fps. dont get it if you think youll survive a bombardment of bullets and walk away perfectly fine, one bullet to the chest and youre done. this game is a slow paced shooter, its takes patience to play. you cant fight two soldiers at once. but what the game does offer is some of the best graphics. and stellar gunplay.this game needs a lot to run. the only cons are the team mates. most are there to play and help you. some asshats are straight from cod. and will shoot you and not help the team. two tips you need to know, this  is tough, your k/d doesnt mean jack  to you. its about the team winning. second, its about team work, telling people where tanks and soldiers are location is a must. team work people is the key to victory.",278.6

"good game, can drive off a cliff and do barrel rolls",59.6
"so, i built my pc specifically to play dayz and such games. then arma 3 was released and i shyd away from the zombie series and into full on warfare instead. after coming from the cod franchise and the battlefield games, i was scepticle that i could be any good playing warfare on such a massive scale, let alone on pc. i got cracking and found that this game was actually very very well built. the graphics are smooth and crisp (depending on your setup) the gameplay is solid and immrsive and you quickly get sucked in to the firefights and stuff. campaign i found was a little left out, it felt like the game was centred as much around the multiplayer aspect as possible (i was used to that from playing cod) overall its an awesome game, would recommend just for the multiplayer part.",68.5
"fun strategy army game, you are basically an one man army. awesome online gameplay and mods i recommend it (6.5/10)",135.0
"really good! hard to see enemies at 100m. dlc is a buzz kill for costing so much atfer spending 63 bucks on the game itself. not having the dlc does not take away from the experience at all, unless you plan on playing online in a modded servers that requires you to have the dlc and other mods installed. i put yes for recommend but having not yet finished the game my review is still a bit mixed.",27.2
"a very fun, military game that gets really intense.",82.1

"at first i was like - (   ) but then - (   ) and then a bit after- (   )",204.3
"coming from games like battlefield/counter-strike this was a nice change. theres a lot of little things to get used to, i.e. theres like 10 different stances all that can lean left/right. the ballistics are simulated and pretty well done aside from velocities of some guns. plenty of vehicles/aircraft to get the job done and offer a challenge, even though the flight models are still somewhat arcadeish/linear. the scale of the maps is just crazy, although everything kinda looks the same, its all laid out very believably. theres a few game modes for mp that are worth giving a try, mainly king of the hill/wasteland and i guess altis life but i havent tried it more than 10 minutes. one thing though, in mp games theres not much you can do fps wise when theres >60 players, you will get <25 fps in cities, it doesnt even matter how good your computer is. the sp campaign is good but the controls for ai still need a lot of work and more often than not they just die without following orders. the developers are constantly updating this game everyday with frequent patches so with that id give a rating of 8/10 at $60",318.1

"im going to be completely honest, i bought this game almost exculsively to play the battle royale game mod. as such, i have played very little of the actual campaign of vinilla experience. i can say though that if you like or enjoyed arma style games, you will appreciate the leve of detail and dedication to realism this series provides. the controls are responsive, and the guns handle amazingly. every time i died, it was 99% my fault and the other the lag i blame and curse over the microphone as i mourn my body. if you apprciate more realism to your games then straight up, over the top action, i would recomend giving this series a try. i did not mind spending the money and i bought this before the summer sale. i would highly recomend looking at the modding scene as well which is normally very active with arma series titles (look at the dayz mod)",7.8

"a great game, fun to play with friends. honestly, i feel a bit ripped off by the lack of content provided by the developers, and the gameplay seems aimed at entertaining the call of duty/battlefield fps crowd. they continue to update it with new content, but it just doesnt hold my interest very long. not to mention the many unrealistic features they added in to make it combat seem more fluid and fast if you are overflowing with $$$, and you feel like buying it, go ahead. i would not recommend buying it just yet.",114.3

"arma 3 has industry leading gameplay mechanics, which show a number of improvements. optimization, graphics, and sound effects have improved considerably, but it still isnt excellent in terms of optimization or sound effects. steamworks integration is a very nice bonus. its a better game than arma 2, especially when you consider that its best played in private co-op sessions on custom missions, but its very disappointing to see that arma 3 has no noteworthy game-changing new features. its a great mil-sim, the core game is very good and better than any other mil-sim, but its also a poor sequel. the first release has minimal content, which is now expected due to the sudden change of an episodic release. see my full review here:",100.4

"if you are looking for another fps to play like cod, this is not for you. this game brings a much larger meaning to combat oriented games. the situations that you have to adapt to, the fact that the map is about 19 sq. km, and how fluid everything is compared to arma ii, thesse are all factors of the this game that stand out to me the most. this game is not for any cod player (or battlefield at that) that just wants to shoot people for fun. once you get used to everything and how the game is played, it really latches on to you. especially when you have some buddies to bring with you.",87.1

"i dont really like the vanilla game, also the old arma ii missions like domination 2 and insurgency are terrible. but when you play in an experienced group with a few hundred mods. its freaking awesome. vanilla i dont like the gameplay and their are only a few weapons. but with some mods this game has no limits. try to find a group or clan who makes their own missions and you will have an amazing time. if not, good luck with the single player.",121.9

"im writing this review because steam wants me to. also arma 3 is awesome.",942.4
"much like its predecessor, arma 3 is an outstandingly good game. the sandbox action and incredible battles that the player can create are absolutely brilliant, and its great graphics also provide a treat for the eyes. that being said, i cant recommend it entirely. the amount of realism is a bit too much, and i guess thats the dilemma with shooters. theres one series that makes about as much sense as the plot of batman & robin, a totally unrealistic game; but with this, its like, you walk 10 feet and then you have the aim of an imperial stormtrooper. also, the amount of keys it has is a bit too much to bear at some times, and configuring them can be an absolute nightmare. my ultimate verdict is that i recommend arma 3, but there are still some things that i dont really like about it. im not attempting to ward off potential buyers, but just know that every rose has its thorns.",269.6
"really worth buying. you can go ride go-karts, play battle royale with friends, play breaking point with friends, play wasteland with friends. the only problem with the game is when you dont have any friends that have this game to play with. 9/10 from me.",55.9
"i remember playing this game after getting a taste of arma 2 and i was so disappointed. i joined a invade and anex server and got killed over and over by the super op aim hack ai. i was just about to rage quit, when one of the server group members asked me if i wanted to join their squad to play with them. they told me what to do and after an hour i got the sweet taste of arma team play. i joined the group after a while and started playing user made missions with mods and holy . it has been the best year of gaming i have ever had. if you like millitary tactics and teamplay, arma is right up your alley. it is not like any of the big fpss out there, you dont feel like a action movie super soldier. you feel just as vulnerable as the other guy on the receiving end of your barrel. if you are ever going to play this for the milsim part of the game, get yourself a group to play with. nr. one advice. i watch this every time i wonder why i play arma and i just want more:",864.8
"i love the game, awsome map, great textures the hard thing is get used to the control",106.1
"probably one of the best fps, military simulator, with endless user add-on and mods i have ever played in my life. its to the point this game is the only one i still play. its far from call of duty and sort of reminds me of the old battlefield games but better. i give it a 10/10 not for the game only but the the continuous community and their mods.",376.5
"feels incredibly unfinished and incomplete on so many levels and in dire need of major improvements and added content to make this as interesting to play as its predecessor. which is a shame as the new infantry controls are a godsend but it does not save a really marred and blemished product that is very lacking. frankly youre better off waiting until the first major expansion until you get this game unless you simply have to play wasteland.",455.6

"initially, i bought this game because i wanted to play wasteland or something coming from arma 2. this was back in alpha. it sucked , and i left the game to collect dust for a long time, then one day when it finally got released, a whole new gaming experience overwhelmed me! completely swept me off my feet with the mechanics that this game has to offer, and due to one of the latest updates being zeus it has made gaming to a whole new level. since becomming a fan of the arma 3 i now own 2 servers for a community named stdelta. its the most fun you could have with a war simulator you could ever have your hands on. would definately reccomend this game to any gamers looking for a challenge in their gaming. live long and drop the the floor and do the dinosaur. ~hash",577.8
"an incredible creation for those with right tools, i simply cannot reccomend this more to those of you with a good amount of ram and a half decent graphics card, otherwise you are in for a hard time. i like to look at games on how good they can be, not how good they are on a crappy little e-machine. on arma3 i have had some of the best memories in pc gaming thanks to the great community that plays it and the ahrd work bohemia interactive has put into this masterpiece. pros: -active modding community -great graphics/attention to detail -engaging and exciting storyline with memorable characters cons: -you will need a beast pc to have an enjoyable experience -pricey dlcs -some issues with fps (bi says it is related to the engine and will be optimized) overall i really do reccomend arma3 to the military enthusiast to the casual fps gamer:) enjoy.",554.5

"okay this game is amazing and pretty as crysis, if not, more pretty, the detail put into this game is beond imagination, its fantastic, and the game is really good, but it is a miltary sim, and not like battlefeild, its pretty much one bullet in the right spot and youre done, so you have to be patent, and to conlude this review im going to tell you the only ture con of this game, this game requires a gaming setup, it is very cpu heavy i suggest having an i7, and a good one at that, the gpu is pretty standerd requirments on this game but have a good cpu, and this game is very fun",65.2

"i love this game so much. but you really need to enjoy these types of games in order to keep playing this title from behemia interactive. this game has its ups and downs, first ill start with the cons .... you need a beefy computer to run it. this game is really taxing for your pc even though on max settings it doesnt look that amazing. its only because of its huge map and sandbox gametype. this game also has a few bugs that you can ignore because it doesnt affect your gameplay. but this game is fun as hell. delviering realistic gameplay like you are truely in the army fighting, i suggest putting on headphones and maxing out the effects sound option so those gunshots are loud! this game gets really intense, because you know even one bullet could end you... overall i suggest you buy this game but maybe when its on sale. if this game sounds amazing to you, then buy it now. 8.5/10",58.3

"this game has a lot of available game modes because of how many mods (mission files) people make. this game is diverse because of the modding community that the arma series has. while the game still needs more firearms to be implemented into it, i am sure the modding community will fix that issue. this game has been out for a couple years now and is doing strong. arma 2 had a strong following and i do hope that this will too. one downfall about this game that has been around since the alpha is that usb headsets are hit and miss. sometimes they have certain sounds cut out. the way i went around this issue is by selecting my optical out as my default instead of my usb headset (skullcandy plyr1). another downfall is the content. the game takes place the near future however the game does not include any current era firearms that are being used in any military force.",257.8

"ok so the bottom line is, this is not just a shooter, its not just a multiplayer shooter similar to the likes of black ops 2, aw or anything like that, it is as close to a military simulator. i love koth(king of the hill) great game & can be played as alone wolf or with friends. i have to give this 11/10",551.7
"at first it was not like any war game. it was one of the worst. then i played it a bit more. i do not believe love on first sight, so i built it up. now i love this game more than any other game! you just need to find your favourite game modes (that players have scripted) like king of the hill or altis life. everyone can find their own! just make sure you do not play alone. fighting alone in war is not fun! also, i strongly recommend using your brain to come out from difficult situations. 360 noscope will not help you in arma.",680.0

"so here is a military sim. it is a a very fun military sim. i have sat down and played most of the campaign, which had been enjoyable. a majority of my time has been put towards the mulitiplayer. the game has very many options and mods to play when it comes to multiplayer, some of them being breaking point, wasteland and king of the hill. all of them are great fun and i have had to at least sink about 15 hours in each. if you are looking for something that is fun to play with a group of friends and is a military sim, then this is a game for you. i would give this about 3.5/5. just because it still does have some bugs but would gladly say that this has the potential to be a 5/5 game once a lot of those issues are ironed out.",65.3

"this is a realistic shooter, with teamwork and everything. at some points you can be so immersed into this game that you think you are a real soldier that is fighting in a war. i also think this is a game that people would say buy this game for me to their friends or family for the holidays.",12.6

"the greatest military sandbox i have ever played, arma 3 is a lovingly crafted game, giving you an endless amount of scenerios to enjoy. singleplayer gives you the option to screw around with the editor and either create the insane or the epic. its a challenge to learn but well worth it. the main campaign can be frustrating at times, but overall is a very excellent experience. user-made content and scenerios add another layer of depth, and zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer. multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game, giving an in-depth experience in many a situation. you can play it as a roleplayer, joining life servers. you can be a survivor of the wastes in wasteland, or you can join in many user-made situations. the greatest of the options, however, is proper, team-based objective gameplay. with the right men, squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds. it gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team, and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling. if you want a very-well made military simulator, offering wonderful graphics, processor-melting situations, teamwork, tension and combined-warfare operation, arma 3 is for you.",763.8

(type altis in server filter to find altis servers or wasteland etc) etc this is just example :d",257.9

"like its predecessor, arma 3 really raises the bar in the gaming industry. graphics, beautiful... physics, fluid... gameplay... enagaging... you wont find a shooter like it! the number of mods is growing rapidly, and thats what really makes the arma series what they are today. as with arma 2, you are purchasing a game, with many separate games embedded for mulitplayer, or singleplayer. due to the fact that this game is full release, there are no major issues, and its only recently been available! however i would recommend waiting for a sale or buying this game elsewhere, as i do think 40 is a little steep, atleast for me.",85.3
"from altis life to breaking point arma 3 has become one of my favorite games. their are countless amounts of missions and game modes you can play, i highly recommend this game to everyone!",64.8
"so worth buying i spend hours in editior creating situations and living them, get this game search armaholic on google and get teh a3mp map pack. you will never leave your pc 11/10",263.5
"this game is fantastic and multiplayer is excellent great game cant wait for more dlc",124.7
"this is like a drug. murder simulation, the sound is probably the best thing about this game. the first time you fire a simple 6.5mm round you realize this game is on a completely different level from anything else. some games can be more fun, but none are more real. sometimes youll have memories of killing people on certain maps and youll wake up in the morning and remember it, that place you went to and that person you killed. genuinely a feeling of disconnection will grow when you play other games because you dont feel like they properly exteriorize a sense of realism compared to arma 3. the sunlight is like video game wizardry ill never understand. closing this review ill say you should have confidence in yourself, play the multiplayer from the start, switch your rate of fire, run and kill kill kill.",511.1

"one of the most realistic games and best game ive played",32.9
"arma 3 is the most replayable game ever. its so easy to create your own content, and if you join a clan or just play with some friends you will always have something to do. yes, arma has its bugs; and yes they can be annoying. but the pros just out weigh all of the cons: buy the game.",197.9
"a great game -- if you can get past the bugs, of which there are plenty. id have to argue, however, that this is one of the most fun games on steam. the mission possibilities are literally endless. the people that play it -- well, you get used to them. i cant wait for the snipers dlc, ill be buying it as soon as it comes out. this is the most realistic game ive ever played, and if you like military simulators, youre going to love arma 3!",451.3
"good sim where all mistakes are punished by death.",621.0
"if you are looking for a real army simulator, then youre on the right place arma 3 is the best army simulator experience you ever wanted with a good story line and the freedom to choose to do everything you want, there are no straight checkpoints, you aint going to be shooting at a enemy for 2 hours one bullit could kill you depends on where you get shot. this is straight away just the best militairy game ever made you have the freedom to do everything with the content creator. the only question you should ask yourself is.. why did it took so long to have this game!!! its worth the money. especially with online multiplayer on a big map with the freedom to do anything with anyone. see you in the battlefield!",249.6
"not only is it one of the most beautiful settings in all of video games, it is the most accurate military simulator avalible, always great fun with large parties of friends, but you also meet great people by playing in game, recommend you get teamspeak for this game, and research some great mods, becuase it is a large community modded game which makes it even more fun. also watch some how tos before you play so youre not totally blind sided, also know this is not call of duty, the game involves tactics and survival instinct to play, you will get destroyed if you one man army in this game. only down side is you do need something relitivly powerful to run the game so look at your specs. otherwise great game.",45.4
"didnt bring much to the table in my own opinion, but the addition of more modern controls and the addition of newer smoother animations makes it a nice upgrade from arma 2",35.6
"i got this game a week before it goes on sale. fgysuajiefuighw. dont play it on anything less then gt 750. sure you can get 35-45 on a gt 650 on single player but multiplayer kills 20 frames no matter what. if you liked the old arma 1 or 2 you will enjoy this much improved game. guns with their physx bullets are amazing.",8.1
"absolutely amazing. i was a little worried about the learning curve and all the action buttions you can use but it honestly took me about 30 hours of playting to understand everything. maps are really fun and this game is surprisingly addictive. the whole dynamic of the game is just mind blowing, the developers p[aid attention to detail. youll find yourself at the edge of your seat smiling and wanting to share some of the crazy stuff that happens in the game with someone because its just so realistic. buy the game and get ready to be submerged into one of the greatest games youll ever play. (i was a peasant who liked to play destiny, halo, battlefield. etc so the learning curve isnt too bad or a chore).",74.1
"this game is great. unlike most modern shooters, arma 3s engine and combat mechanics are complete poop. this leaves the most strategic player the victor instead of the player with the best twitch reflex. rewarding strategy over reflex in a fps is refreshing.",482.6
"fun game, very in depth if felt for an fps. you should have patience for some servers though, they will be figuring out which line you should stand in more than they will be doing stuff. if you like planetside 2 for the organization or players, this game will be fun for you.",16.2
"i like this game. i played my first fps years ago starting with doom and at that time i was blown away, and could never of dreamed of anything better. boy was i wrong. the next game to capture my imagination was meadal of honour and the single player world captured my imagination and heart. with meadal of honour came the first real multiplayer action that i enjoyed and i couldnt stop playing. next game to follow was call of duty, a great series of games that offered plenty of run and gun action... great stuff. the progression to battlefield for a more indepth experience blew what came before away. now battlefield looked to offer with its later installments a more realistic battle experience, but it fails. infantry are fine but the vehicles,which look great,in my opinion start to ruin the game series. that brings me to arma 3,, wow ,, once again i am blown away and once again what came before falls into history. animations, lighting, movment and the environment are a dream come true. this is a truely epic game.",66.7
"extremley fun, extremely low price and a great amount of content, if you liked the previous arma games then its a no-brainer, buy it!",216.0
"this game is plain amazing. it will give you countless hours of gameplay hours to play with your friends or even by yourself. there is workshop support/many mods that add new scenarios everyday. the developers are also constantly working on this and they come out with a major update about every month that adds even more hours. there is a singleplayer campaign that will probably last around ten hours(im not sure about this) with a great story that helps you get to understand the game in more depth. the multiplayer has tons of servers and tons of players with a bunch of different amazing modes. 10/10 superb game that will last you forever.",146.6
"havent played much of the game but from what i have, i can definitely say id recommend it to anyone who enjoys fps war simulation games. the campaign will challenge you. there are an assortment of co-op missions and the game supports steam workshop as well as various other mods and added missions. the multiplayer is where this game shines. with several different game types that will keep you coming back for more. if you get bored of doing the usual from what this game offers you can join fun multiplayer game types such as altis life, battle royal, or wasteland. im not sure if i would have spent the asking price of this game; however, if you can get it on sale it is definitely worth around $30 for as much as youd get out of the game.",57.1
"great game.gives you that original war feeling.for those who are interested in tactical gaming this is the game for you.",41.0
"what a piece of , glitchy, unrealistic game! i cant believe they released such a crappy game. the helo flying is horrendous (i am a helo pilot in real life). nothing is easy, specially during the learning curve, tutorails are not there to help you learn but to help you lose your cool and feel like deleting the game. i dont recommend, dont waste your money. if i could i would love to have my money back. disgusting.",14.7
"this game is an incredibly realistic and tactical shooter, with the addition of the editor mode, this game becomes so much more. it has its bugs but still they are forgiveable, altis life and battle royal are extremely fun and addicting. a warning before you buy though; practise your skills in the editor before you move onto multiplayer, requires a fairly good pc, make sure you watch some tutorials and gameplay before buying since if you buy this game and find it wont run on your pc, or you some how simpley dont like the game $60 is a fair bit of a waste of money. overall i give arma iii 9/10. hope you found this review helpful!!! =p",584.2

"a2 but with all bugs fixed, well most, but im very upset that i bought it at the beginning of the week and wasnt thinking of steam summer sale, and now its $20 less. grrrr. but yeah this arma is way more realistic, way improved, weapon customization, smoother gameplay, and if you are really looking for some tactical realism, this game is home to the most serious gaming clans. but hey its $40!! buy it!",16.4
"with visually stunning graphics and endless posibilities in the mission editor, arma has given my friends and i countless fun since its release. while the controls may be a bit combersome and the aiming a bit shaky, it is quickly forgotten when those intense firefights breakout. hundreds of mods on armaholic provide loads of free addons, making the game into anything whether it be the revolutionary war, wwii, iraq & afghanistan wars, or even some futuristic battle in the mediterranean sea. content although lacking from the initial release is stil being added and once again the mods make up for it. the game is so versitile it truly is unmatched on the market place. i would highly reccomend the game to anyone who enjoys a much more tactical and open environment fps rather than your typical paintball style play.",301.1
"ok so this review is quite short and you probably think its really stupid but anyways. this game is amazing from the user created mods to the interesting missions and level editor. i got this game about a year ago and instantly got hooked to the king of the hill mod my first day of playing it i got to about rank 12 and i loved every second. the next day i started playing some more but when i logged on i was banned why? no idea ws admin ban (random numbers i dont care about) i thought it was just that server so i tried joining another banned tried another banned until i realized i was banned from all servers. this especially sucked because i had just baught the game and i was not hacking i have played flashpoint arma cold war arma 2 arma 2 oa and never cheated/hacked in those games. due to this incident i can not recommend this game as i wasted my money and only bothered to do this review now because i watched a rhinocrunch video sniping 101 which was awesome and i hungered for arma but i never satisfied it.",197.3
"easily worth the price a military simulator with so many options. if you havent played arma before you will find the controls daunting but once you get used to them the game is great. the other issues can be de sync(lag) and low frame rate on some maps. this can make the game frustrating but the good times in this game out weigh the bad unlike some of the big aaa titles over the last few years. the thing about arma games is the longer they are out the better they get because of the community created mods. arma2 is still a great game which i still play and has a huge following. some of my favourite arma3 mods are wasteland, king of the hill, altis life and many more. you arnt really buying a game you are buying countless options and countless gaming sessions. buy it, this game is on sale often so keep an eye out.",584.3
"extremely fun military simulation. beautfiul simulation and great controls/gameplay. but the thing i love the most i altis life gamemode in multiplayer its one of the best thing iv ever played theres so many options to do whatever you like.",271.8
"brilliant game. when it first came out, the game was buggy, glitchy, and pretty much unplayable. but that was to be expected. now its a brilliant combat simulator which i love to play in my spare time. easy on the frames, great scenery, and awesome weapons. the update on the physics engine was on par as well. but i would say they need to dumb down the fatigue system. after running 50 metres with heavy gear and becoming fatigued is to be expected, but the character waves around the gun like hes aiming for a fast moving dragonfly. but thats the only thing they need to work on. overall, this game is a must in your steam library list. 10/10",139.6
"where taking a bullet in the head is more easy than learn the keyboard control.",103.7
"after trying for about 5 hours in vain to just get past a small phase in a mission in the game, i can finally say i gave up. above the insanely hardcore combat system, i got killed countless times by mines that i cant understand how to tell their location, so its just a simple, annoying, random death. also the game has a lot of bugs, mainly graphic. id say the devs rushed too much. 5/10 game health, 3/10 gameplay, 8/10 graphics, -30/10 gameplay forgiveness. bought the game when it was 50% off and i regret spending every and each $ for this game which i just cant play.",5.3

"arma iii is not a love hate relationship, it is a relation comprised of ruthless, and merciless defeat and frustration. this game made me pour hundreds of hours of my life, into a virtual world, where i only die. i could not recommend this more to someone who wishes to experience what its like to be a complete failure. playing arma, is like when you swap from cod to battlefield, except you are being constantly reminded, that you are vulnerable. 10/10, would bearing 000000",247.4

"awesome! great balance between fun and realism. multiplayer is fun with lots of custom maps available to play.",276.9
"arma 3 is one of the best games there is way better than bf4 and cod but at the moment the game is broken since the latest update and devs have no clue how to fix it so i would check forums to see if it is fixed before buying .when it works its a great game .",302.8
"this game is is the top military simulation (it is the only one). only problem for this game you must have high end pc standard to high graphic, in cod you will play at max setting. for ultra settings you need at least i7 and 2 gfx cards. i play on standard to ulta setings with 40 - 80 fps. what definitly need a big update and fix is terrain builder and other tools for making maps and mission. for game i give 9/10 need more optimization for editor 5/10 need a lot more work and better setup, guide and documentation... too long learning curve, hard to make decent maps without help from youtube and lots of forums reading and searching.....",55.8
"compared to arma 2 this game is no where near as good as arma 2 was. pros: goodish graphics better voice acting more enterable buildings slightly more realistic sounds cons: terrible fps on a good pc hardly any weapons hardly any air vehicles altislife is crap so save your money",115.9
"realistic warfare to a whole different scale is armas specialty, giving players the unique experience to play simulated firefights between either pvp, or pve. for the most part, arma 3 has a good community. most people communicate with their teams to lead them into cities, complete objectives, or simply talking to a pilot to let them know where to drop you off. i do not recommend trying to play as a cod player in this, trying to use a sniper in a city, or trying to quickscope. youd probably die really fast. anyway, there were only some problems with arma 3, such as minor bugs (that are not that noticible; rare), or major bugs that havent been fixed yet. also, some players seem to take this game a little too seriously. ive seen many players who havent played the arma series and wanting to try to use vehicles for the first time. some players dont allow them as (obviously, being a beginner) theyre not good, or wasting precious vehicles that could have been useful. overall, its a great game, but dont take it too seriously and just remember its a game, not real life. graphics: 9.8/10 sound: 8.5/10 gameplay: 9.7/10 community: 7.5/10 overall: 8.9/10",33.2

"the nato forces had us pushed back to our final two bases, i was stationed at the northern camp. our forces were beaten back hard, and we were scattered. i battled fatigue up the hill to get a vantage point looking down across the east from the beach to the mainland, i adopted the prone position and set up my lmg and scoped the area. thats when i saw it, a brown figure darting accross the fields below, performing evasive maneuvers the likes i had never seen. it was an intense 5 minutes, leading the target and squeezing the trigger to deliver a burst of rounds at my foe. finally my enemy took refuge (or so he thought) on a ridge nestled between two trees. i aimed precisely, meaning for this to end and took my final shots. i observed for several minutes when i decided to go and get a certain status on my enemy. as i walked up to the ridge i could not see my enemy in sight, so i looked around some more. it must have been 30 seconds until i looked down and saw his little b***** whiskers and his **** floppy a*** ears and noticed my god damned foe was a mother f******* bunny rabbit. 10.01/10 will definitely buy",130.4
"great game. in my oppinnion its probally the best military game i ever played graphics are outstanding but the multiplayer was disapointing when i got banned from 80% of the servers after only playing it for a few days . they wouldnt even tell me what i was being accused of and never gave me a warning about anything just random perma ban on most servers. very disapointed and sad because i was just getting into the game and having a great time with my new computer i just built to play it :(",52.2

"unrealistic. walked up behind someone unloaded an entire clip of an m4 into them. 25 yards away with them not seeing me or even knowing im in the bush behind him. he turns around and one shot me with a makarov? just very unrealistic on the things that should be real and the things that doesnt matter they focus on.",42.1
"arma 3 is a very special game. the realism that is blended with the game really brings the game to life. the maps in the game are extremely huge, allowing for people to roam and have great battles. the gamemodes associated with arma 3 show what fun can be had. battle royale is among my favorites, where the game is a hunger-games-like survival competition. there is a variety of vehicles, including aerial and sea. the weapons have many attachments, and some have the unique trait to have tracers. overall, the game is a thrilling experience. 9/10",13.7

"arma 3 is one of the best games i play; with its large maps and units. even after the singleplayer and senarios are finished you can do things such as: the editor, multiplayer or zeus. something to do in arma 3 that i would recomend is to go on a co-op server, such as ahoyworldss invade and annex servers, and play with other people against infantry ai. but even if you find the amount of equipment (e.g. tanks or guns) you can always mod the game. the arma modding comunity is huge, for example if you want to use less modern weapons, you can probably find it, even if you want to scrap the military aspect you can get things such as altislife. therefore i think that this game is a seriously good game and i would recommend it to others.",458.3

"i dont play classic arma 3 modes, but i play battleroyale and its awesome! highly recommended for expirienced fps players who love hardcore gaming. sadly arma 3 has lots of troubles with fps and it not so easy to google the solution, but its still very good game!",64.0
"this game is something unique and special pros: -modding community makes aditional content almost infinate. (there are some mods in development that look very promissing, im looking at you dayz epoch for arma 3) -massive map to explore -scenarion editor makes almost any imganinable scenario possible -extremely relistic (this could be a con to some) -graphically impressive for its size -massive longevity considering both the mod availiability and the scenario editor -very detailed environment cons -buggy, like very buggy, like has the potenial to ruin your day buggy -very steep learning curve, prepare to spend the first few in game hours learning how to move let along fly, drive, command a squad etc... -so buggy it deserve two mentions. -poorly optimized. no matter what setting i use i cannot run anything over high and even that ryns at 30fps. dont even both if you have a low end pc. overall this game has things to offer that no other game does but it suffers because of an engine that is difficulty for any pc to run. i fully recomend but understand if you pass it over because it looks so intimidating.",134.9
"great visual effects, a stunningly immense map with detailed environments and immersive gameplay, arma 3 is one of (if not the best) military simulators currently available. casual gamers beware, the name of the game in arma is realism and bohemia interactive has spared no attention to detail. arma is merciless, running and gunning into an enemy squad will get you killed in two seconds flat. alertness, caution, cover, strategy and teamwork will win the day. strongly recommended for the more serious fps players and those wanting a truly rewarding gameplay experience.",497.4

"this review is mostly on the vanilla version or the base game you buy. i say mostly because i recently started playing with the agm mod. anyhoo... arma 3 is a great game in my opinion. it is nothing like the general populations idea of a first person shooter (fast-pace, best connection required, twitchy shoot each other). this game actually requires you to think and try and stuff. you have to try to out think and out strategize your enemy. if i had to choose this or arma 2 oa strictly on gameplay, i would chose this hands down. now with every game there are a few things that could be changed. in the vanilla arma 3 those things are ai that can snipe using only a red dot sight, the small amount of guns, small amount of vehicles, and your friendly ai skipped the week in basic training where they learned to listen to their co. the thing about all arma games is that they are easily moddable. so all of these problems have been addressed with mods. overall i would give this game an 8/10. it is extremely fun to play coop missions with your friends along with things like wasteland and altis life. i havent played breaking point at the time of this review, the arma 2 dayz epoch mod has pretty much kept me satisfied with zombies.",231.3
"arma iii is a so vast game that 100 pages would not be enough to describe it properly. suffice to say this, then: arma iii is not a military simulator. arma iii is the military simulator. of course, there are still many small glitches and bugs that need to be fixed, but overall we are faced with a product extremely better than arma ii and any other military game ever released. in a word: masterpiece.",7.9
"dissapointing amount of vanilla content to be honest, and with the dlc coming it sucks even more, but a worthy upgrade from arma 2 or an entry into arma if you have the #cashmoney.",155.4
"the game itself is remarkable. arma2 + much better graphics. the mechanics require some getting used to, but the gameplay is fun and very realistic. excellent combat simulator. if you are not used to combat sims, there is a steep learning curve, but it is much easier to learn than in arma 2. the action and movement mechanics are much more fluid. once you get bored of singleplayer there is multiplayer involving co-op (team up with others to complete objectives), wasteland (join one of 2 factions, or go at it alone on island, surviving and killing others), and a plethora of scenarios and mods to play with. most of my gametime is currently on the breaking point mod. the mod gives an unique experience than just normal multiplayer. you will have to use tatics and strategy to survive from zombies, nature, and other hostile players. i had this game since alpha release and it is a must get if you loved arma ii and dayz. if you want a realistic, tatical shooter, this is it. no call of duty, counter-strike, battlefield  here. beware you will need (cpu) processing power to run this game. gpu power not so much.",542.5
"slowly becoming addicted, the mods make this game what it is. although it deserves a lot of praise as vanilla arma 3",108.3

"only ever played the wasteland mod. its harsh and fun.",387.4
"this game is absolutely beautiful. some of my best moments have been on this game, not only is the vanilla game absolutely brilliant but the modding community is also spectacular. you can play as marines, army, navy, whatever you choose. that being said, some further optomization is necessary as this game has major lag spikes and crazy fps drops, even in singleplayer. i have played for 300 hours and have yet to play the campaign, its great. if you are wondering what this game requires graphics card wise, i am playing with a msi radeon r9 270x which is a mid range card, on all ultra at average of 50-60 fps (on singleplayer). for a long time i was playing with a nvidia geforce 610 which is a low end card but wsa still able to play and had great expierences with. so overall, no matter what your specs are, buy this game. if your specs arent quite good enough to run it on ultra or high the sheer gameplay expierences will make you want to invest mor time, and of course more money on pc games. gameplay 10/10 graphics 9/10 fps 7/10 storyline (from what ive seen from others and from the few missions i have dabbled in) 9/10 overall 9/10 would play",819.1
"i couldnt reccommend this game anymore if i tried. it is very fun, very replayable, and intense at times. the zeus addition to the real time editing of scenarios has made this so much better tahn arma 2 its practically silly. the modding community is as good as it has always been maybe even better. there is plenty of servers and people to play with etc... go buy it!! nowwwww!!! :p",152.7

"why cant arma 3 be simble to play with friends or remotely. this rarely works. i followed step by step with the ports and ip address. the firewall has been turned off. any advice?",93.1
"this is arma 3, not call of duty. you need to practice communication, strategy, situational awareness, as well as being able to listen!!!!! listening is above all else the most important. unlike fail of duty, you need to help the squad you are in when in multiplayer mode; not who can have the biggest electronic  and showing they are on the top of the list. all this shows is that you are a gloryhog and a piss poor player, but mostly an , that will have you excluded from future multiplayer games. also unlike fail of duty the calibre of rifles plays key as well as environment conditions, like bullet drop and wind. if you play call of duty, this game is not for you! go play with the other prepubescent inbreds, or socially/maturity  adults, to compare imaginary  with and see who is the biggest  of all. if you do like tactics and strategy, then this game is for you. again, if youre a call of duty player, look forward to the next craptacular expansion of that horrible series.",53.6

"ive played 20 hours of this game, 18 of them have been in altis life alone, and the rest in wasteland and single player. this is one of the most enjoyable games ive ever played. when im not playing, i think about what im going to do when i play altis life next. a little about altis life. its basically real life in arma 3. you can play as a cop or a civillian. if you play as a cop, you enforce the law. pull people over for speeding, hunt down criminals, bust druggies. if youre a civillian, you can become a rebel, and basically be the bandits of altis life, or you can just make drugs, and sell them and become a millionaire. the choice is yours. i highly recomend this game, as long as you can deal with a few bugs. if you do end up buying the game. i highly recommend playing altis life. no mods/downloads needed. all you have to do is join a server, and remember the server name so you can continue where you left off.

"if you enjoy having to trek 3 kilometers to take out one soldier and then trek to the next objective for another 20 minutes (real time), then arma is your game. arma is as close as one can get in a game to real-life combat procedures. taking one hit will usually result in death or severe injury...and you dont wanna take a hit when youre 3 kilometers from an objective and have to walk there... there are a few things that you should know first: 1) combat is slow-paced and tactical 2) there are a lot of different controls that youll need to know 3) the online community is great for help 4) with enough time and imagination, there are very few things that you cant do/create in arma the guides that come in-game are very useful and are a must-read if you want to have a good play experience. all-in-all, for the amount of content that comes with arma 3 and the amount of content streaming-in constantly from users as well as can be made by you, this game will give you unlimited hours of entertainment, provided that you put the time into learning the controls properly. this is a steal for $60, and anything cheaper is almost a crime for the amount of value that lies within this game. even if youre not into military shooters, this game has more than just something for everyone.",101.2

( it is singleplayer, but i dont recommend playing alone ). war has never been accurate in a video game like it is in arma 3. instead of run & gun combat, you experience patient and heart pounding moments knowing the fact that if you die in a mission, its a game over. work with your friends to find advantage points to your enemys and call air support if a tank has you under fire. and if you get it in maybe the leg or arm, you can always bandage yourself to avoid bleeding to death. many missions usually last many hours so be sure to have nothing to do during the day and time in your hands. and if arma still feels like its missing something, visit",101.1

"arma 3 is a one of the best purchases i ever made. considering that not only you get the main game (army simulator), but you can get many more mods (for free ofc), which are so much fun. for example battle royal, which is the mod leaving you and lot of other players on a n island, where you have to find a weapon, and kill everyone else to win (basicaly same as in the movie hunger games, or battle royale). another one breaking point is the one familiar to dayz. or there is a role playing mode where you are thrown into the city, and only you choose whether you are going to be criminal, or cop, or doctor, or anyone else. thing about this game is that its engine is really open for comunity to make its own modifications of the game. this game is based on comunity, so if you are bored of regular deathmatch shooters, and want to play shooter with more realistic atmosphere and better interaction with people, there is not better game for this pupose. and if you didnt actually get what i ment by this long boring review, just google a little bit and try to find many exciting mods that exist, or are in development. shortly... if gaben gives you sale on arma iii, go for it, you wont regret the money you will spend.",21.6

"for someone not big on shooters, this game amazed me. its definitively a game, because its tons of fun, but many would rather call it a simulator - in this game i have stayed hidden in the bushes watching an enemy squad pass by, not to ambush them but simply to survive, and adrenaline was sky high the whole non-combat encounter. cant even describe the battles, except awesome. pros: so realistic in many aspects many roles to play, from civillian, to infanterist, to pilot, to general, and every step between. huge - insanely huge - maps (up to 200km squared!) many ways to play, play sp military missions, online mp missions, mp pvp, sp/mp sandbox pvp/pve and even rp! your own powerful (complex) mission editor - user-created content galore! mods! mods! mods! mods! mods! so much more... check out vids by dslyecxi or jester14 on youtube for good insight cons: steep learning curve first time, complex (though well-working) controls demanding for your hardware on graphical high settings and rendering distances (>4km) seems to have some time-space-twisting effect where hours dissappear into adrenaline-ridden joy one of my all-time favorites. and i dont like many shooters.",180.2

"yes, i recommended this game, but its not that great. this is only my oppinion, to me the game is ok i guess, but it has a lot of bugs. also, its not that fun. the game would be more worth it if it was about 25 bucks, but nooooo it has to be super expensive. yes the game looks nice but it didnt change at all from arma 2. (again not worth it) well, if your into this kind of game, go ahead and buy it, don t let me stop you. but if you are not that into super hard core serious games than i suggest you dont get it, its a waste of money.",48.2

"possibly the worst game created so far, even compared to really  indie titles. this game was never optimized for a computer from the look of things. if you run intel anything youll be fine, but god forbid that you run amd youll get 0-20 fps no matter what situation. the developers for this game are autistic  who have clearly never cared for gameplay in anything, sure you can argue its a simulator, not a game but its still a military simulator. there is no effort for gunplay whatsoever in this torm of a simulator. all the guns feel the same, bullets never connect where theyre supposed to, you run around feeling clunky as  shooting nerf guns at nothing. tl;dr pros: its a game cons: its a really  game low/nonexistant fps  gunplay models are ugly server list sucks just about every game out there is better than this , and thats terrible seeing as theres a full dev team that made this. just take your $60 and spend it elsewhere, thats all there is to it.",152.8

"arma 3 is as real as it gets in military simulation. i would rank the 3 main military simulator games like this; cod < battlefield < arma. i have played the arma series since arma 2 and i can say that this game requires more use of strategy and skill rather than the other two games listed above. it is not about shoot em up, get points, and level up. it is more like use your advantages and strategy against the enemy to push back or eliminate them. its about teamwork and large amounts of skill to win the mission. there are 2 huge islands in the game with tons of bases and towns on each. there are lots of mods and the multiplayer is fun when you find a good lobby. (i mostly play battle royale and annex). the single player is fun and long and the graphics are amazing if you have a good pc to run them. there are not as many vehicles in this than arma 2, but there are still a lot. the workshop makes getting add-ons a breeze. if i were to give a rating for this game i would give it a 9/10, with the -1 being around half the multiplayer lobbies having near empty or no people in them most of the time. other than that this game is a great buy for people looking for hardcore military simulators.",76.5
"lets start off by saying that, this game is great. totaly worth all the money. now this games does have its flaws. the controls are hard to get used to, almost every key on the keyboard is used for something, or multiple things. also the game engine is broken. if you want this game you need to have one heack of a pc. on single player, full graphics, usually runs nice for me. i do have a gtx geforce 660 ti and a 4.33 ghz prosseser. but sometimes on single player, there are massive framerate drops. on multiplayer, running as low as this game goes, im getting about 20-30 fps. but not always. and now lets get to some more good things. the vide and screen shots dont seem to capture what this game can really do. you can build your own battles, so much to do in multiplayer like regular battles to survivals to get a jjob make money and live your life out with the need to buy guns and fight the rebles and the cops, or be a reble or a cop. the underwater diving and submariens are fun. there is litearaly so so so many gear types, clothes back packs guns attachments, and alot more. so yes, i do highly recomend this game, but only if you have the pc for it.",14.3

"i bought this game with the hopes that it would be an awesome realistic war simulator, it didnt go the way i thought. i wish that steam could let reviewers to choose a neutral option instead of thumbs or down. arma 3 is a really nice game, but also a bloody glitchy one. the game is quite enjoyable so far, but it requires lots of updates to make it even more enjoyable. to give an example of this is that some of the physics in this game are completely illogical! an example is a sports vehicle, you touch a single rock or tree on the road you can say goodbye to your wheels or hull, because the car seems to be made of paper, but when someone shoots your car, it takes like 3 clips to explode it. there are many glitches in this game that destroys the fun i have at some points, and i really hope they fix that soon. in other words, if you intend to buy arma 3, i recommend you to take it with a grain of salt, it would be better if you bought it in a discount.",69.6

"if you were a big fan of operation flashpoint back in the day and you think that the game has totally gotten derailed from where it was before - it actually is the same game with a lot of improvements and enhancements. i totally recommend this game to you if you enjoy tactical gameplay and military simulation. so far my favorite modification is the official arma iii zeus mod, which allows game masters to create their own missions on-the-fly, though they could add some more parameters for zeus servers (so the admin could disable game moderator totally - as sometimes youngsters join up and destroy everything). but so far so good. the game is very tactical and if youre into fast shooter games such as call of duty or battlefield - i really doubt this would be the ideal game for you unless you are willing to learn and see more. this game series goes in depth with the daily things they do in the military nowadays (or well, in the future, as this isnt exactly based on 2014 warfare). i love the game despite the fact that i havent played it too much; but as an old operation flashpoint veteran i would say that this is a great game.",166.4

"highly recommended for serious tactics-gamers. lightyears away from more or less arcade-games like battlefield 3, cod etc. even as an alpha-release its already a great game with really benchmarking features in tactics, gameplay and suspense. as the subtitle says: this is war - or at least something very similar.",94.3

"new mechanics, less gear. thats all i can say. i miss the mass of equipment in arma 2, now a days you can buy some more  purely for vanilla mp servers. so yeah, equipment is in lower quantity with a bit better quality. the downside is the s want you to pay 66 bucks still, i payed around 30 or so when it first came out. so, i recommend this game, lots of cool , but on the other hand ill point out the lack of crap in comparison to arma 3, also vanilla maps suck. modding it is a helpful option to deal with the lack of vanilla .",391.6
"so, another amazing game from bohemia. arma3 is very beautifull and well made game. from arma2 it got more into simulation part, but lacks some vehicles and weapons variety, but all of that is being add... with purchasable dlc (that sucks, but for this game- worth it).",122.0
"arma 3 is a great open world simulation military shooter. its not like your normal run and gun shooter. the game focus more on the realistic side where tactics and team work is key on being successful. arma 3 give you a large variety and options, kind of like battlefield 4. youre able to be just a random grunt or you can fly a helicopter (not as easy as other games) or drive a tank. bohemia interactive did a great job on the graphics of the game as well, it can be hard to find camouflaged players that are not moving unless you have thermal optics or what not. i recommend this game to more of the hardcore gamers who looks for a realistic game. i dont recommend it if your just trying to find a shooter to pop in and out like counter-strike.",627.7

"arma has gone a long way. the game is great, but it could still use some more realism. still too many glitches and the game still doesnt have that feel to it. i do love the game, but still could use some improvements from it. cant wait to see some more realalistic action packed the game has to offer. maybe arma 4 if it happens will bring even more of that and get rid of the robot voices and the big majority of the glitching ai and glitches in general. more planes offered by many countries. the f/a-18, f/a-22, f/a-35, eurofighter, you name it. bring in more planes. the game has the vehicles and the tanks but not the planes.",219.1
"well for starters the game seems like it could be really good. when i first got it about a mouth age i tried it out the frame rate wasnt the best but very playable the i finally decided to trying to learn how to play and load the game up and now im luck to get 10 fps. ive looked around and tried a bunch of different things the i found on different forms but nothing seems to help. i get the same frame rate on low settings as i do on high so really dosnt make sence. its really to bad because this game is exatly what i was looking for. update: i thought i would give it one more try and i hadnt changed anything and now im getting 40 to 60 fps on high settings in single player so hopefully it stays like i have no idea what was wrong before.",90.0

"in all honesty, this game is worse than arma 2 in the simulator area. it just doesnt have the same feel as previous games nor the community. the down fall of the series had to be the creation of many community game types created to cater to the causual gamer community, and now arma 3 feels more like any old fps game since bohemia interactive has not been creating the game with their hardcore fans in mind. there are many instances of copy and pasts from previous games and there were many corners cut and promised features left out to get the game out quicker. this is why i will continue to play arma 2 and not this lousy game. i find it hard to call arma 3 a part of the arma/armed assault series.",160.9

"if youve loved any of the franchise... this one is just the next step in the evolution of the game. the game, in my opinion, seems to play smoother, the ai is a bit smarter, although it still seems like the enemy ai can spot you with ridiculous ease. with the community creating content, the possiblities for this game are endless. i kind of miss the realism of current existing weapons and vehicles and technology, but being set in the near future also gives the developers some creativity as well, and some of the included technology makes for an interesting experience. the campaign seems decent (at time of writing ive only played through the first installment). but the real meat of this game comes from user created content. for anyone who has never played any game in the franchise (arma, arma 2, operation flashpoint etc) this game has quite a large learning curve. that being said... all of the games have had the learning curve. but you have to start somewhere, with a bit of time and dedication, this game can and will be one of the most intense and realistic combat immersion experiences youll ever find.",361.1

"arma 3 is arguably the single most realistic and immersive experience you can find today. it took me quite a while to get it running well, however after its up and running you wont be able to put it down. the maps are insanely huge, allowing for intense tactics. the realism of the guns is where this game really shines. while some may complain that the kick is not entirely realistic you have to adjust the sights for distance. if you get shot even once you will either be dead or have an injury such as a broken leg which only allows you to walk. overall this game is a 9.5/10. aside from some performance issues this game is nothing short of amazing",49.5

"from the short time i played it, it seemed like it would be a fun and well done game. i had too much lag to give it a thorough rundown but some highlights would be the vehicle pyshics, the fatigue and movement factors, recoil, and even armor penetration. the down side is the enormous ammount of cpu usage and the graphics card you would need to run this game. in the future, i would like to see them add a very low graphics setting for people who have to buy computers on a budget and cant get a new one every year. would i recommend this game? for now, i am going to go with a yes because several of my friends have it and love it and after playing it, no matter how little or laggy, it seemed to have some pretty cool features.",3.8
"maybe i just dont get it? maybe ive just been playing too much ghosts and hawken lately to really appreciate it? maybe i was just bored this weekend and couldnt pass up a steam sale? id say get this if you know somebody in real life to play with online. i dont even feel like going into detail, but this is not a good single player campaign compared to some of the other fps titles out. i think the goal of the developers was to create a realistic sandbox and they succeeded there, with respect to bullet trajectory and not being able to get shot up and instantly heal like in other games. it sounds like a lot of people enjoy creating custom missions and getting together as a group to play them. but despite all that, id rather read a tom clancy novel or watch an oliver north show than play this game.",5.4

"the game is great and can be played for hours without a break, the action is smooth and unforgiving one mistake can lead to half your team being slaughtered in a matter of seconds and a swarm of enemy combatants suppressing your position. the epic landscapes that the series is know for is best represented in arma 3 with altis and stratis, two mediterranean paradises that have become the setting for a full scale conflict. my only qualms with the game is the lack of playable content thus far. though the game features three conventional factions and a guerilla faction, only two of the factions have full ground capibilities (nato and csat) leaving the other two at a disadvantage. compared with arma 2 combined operations it holds up pretty well. another problem that doesnt bother a lot of players but bothers me personally is the lack of a full campaign. the only issues that came to mind for me have been noted by bohemia and they are adding the campaign and more content for free. i would totally recommend this game if you have any interest in strategic shooters, if you liked rainbow six, battlefield, or even the less popular reboot of operation flashpoint youll find a warm home in the arma 3 community.",746.7

"if you like battlefield 3 or 4 for the graphics it has, youll appreciate this game. its a really different game though, if you have ever played arma 2 youll find yourself loving this game. when this was in beta i really hated it, regretted paying money for it at all, but then i realized it was a work in progress. the game has really been patched up a ton, the game is located in greece, on an island which actually exists in real life, look that up if you like, its awesome. anyway, when you are alone, not in combat and just walking into a little town and just listen to the ambient sound, youll fase off into another reality. i am not kidding, this doesnt feel like a game at times, playing on role-play servers really adds to that. tldr; great graphics. controls are wonky but thats the engine to blame, its the same engine as arma 2 if i am not mistaken, but once you get used to it its great. mod support is great as well, a lot of fun to be had. multiplayer is fully working, it has its flaws but nothing gamebreaking. hackers ive yet to be annoyed by, nothing too dramatic. price is a tad high, but knowing that black-ops is still rather pricey after a few years of being on the shelves, i think its a fair price since this game is better to begin with. definitely worth buying.",76.7

"my most anticipated releas eof the year! after being an arma 2 junkie for years this fulfills my wishes and brings the arma series to the modern age, also i have to add that this game is probly the most beutiful game ive seen to date. highly modable, sandbox, multiplayer experiance. 10 out of 10 !",290.5

"the game is good. have many thing to do. but now game still lack of the mod i love the most since arma one is warfare mode. which is basebuilld around you to buy unit and explore the map and conquest the town i didnt said game was bad. im still that there will be official release for the warfare mode. the single player is ok for me. but the setting is not i love modern weapon which current in use like in arma 2 more than those prototye weapon. so this arma is still recommend if you want the simulator game that not hard. i love to drive tank and play infantry in this game , but fly model isnt that good so i didnt fly much but it easy enough to fly anyway and if you have friend to play with it awesome as developer including zues mode !!! if you dont want to play with mod this game dont have much thing like arma2 so wait more a bit i believe developer will release more content !!",56.4
"unrefined and jerky -- describes every aspect of this game. even with the settings turned down the animations are horrible and the guns are garbage - i cant even hit a window on the side of a building. bohemia needs to take some pointers from other shooters, refine the animations, fix the guns so they actually can shoot someone, and fix the jerky animations and lag so that whopever you shoot at, is not ghosting and jerking around like someone having a seaizure. i wouldnt even call this and alpha build and this game has been out for years -- no excuses at this point. i want my money back, this game is garbage.",24.8

"great game, i like the king of the hill mode, they seem to be improving it really well. just a lot of buttons, and the steam workshop is a nice touch. only downside is this games horriable engine. the engine its self is from 2001 and its been pushed beyond what it can really handle on the clients side. once you start to add about 20 ai or players the engine starts to use the cpu or video card less and less cuasing a performance drop. i seen maybe 30% cpu/gpu usage on a 106 player king of the hill match with 30 - 35fps hile on armory i can pull well into the 80s with a few players. thats my only gripe about this game. if they would fix that then i would have no complaints at all.",214.0

"a lot less clunky than arma 2, infact arma 3s stance adjust control system should become standard. ive so far found the single player campaign a bit lacklustre, feels overly linear for such a non linear open world map. that said, playing the mod pilgrimage is much much more addictive and shows what this game is capable of. cant comment on multiplayer yet as i wanted to learn the control system (and finish pilgrimage) first but its safe to say thats where the real meat of this game is.",34.2

"excellent military simulator with a wide variety of difficulty options, and editing stuff to customize your own military scenarios. supports steam workshop, achivements, trading cards, all round a much better steam focused game than arma 2. still, arma 2 is arguably better, but arma iii is still a great game. caution: the game may be very dificcult, even for the experience fps players. this game is a military simulator, it isnt cod or battlefield. so keep in mind that even on lowest difficulty, you may find this game very challenging.",128.4
"its a pretty good driving simulator if thats what your looking for. on top of the endless bugs, explosions, and hikes, youll find tons of different gamemodes and mods. the modding community really holds this together and without them this would probably be a piece of trash. after the first ten minutes, using the three guns supplied in the vanilla version of this game will get boring. this game is unfinished and shouldnt be bought. i give it a 10/10",69.3

"i love this game.i remember watching gameplay of the alpha version and when arma was released i bought it even though my pos laptop wouldnt run it.i played and averaged out about 11 fps on minimum settings,but even though it sit in my library i have grown more facial hair so its a plus:)since then i bought a better pc and so its playable now",554.1

"it may not be a shooter for the masses, but arma 3 succeeds where battlefield fails - in being a true open-world combat simulator. you will die (a lot), but as you start to learn how to actually play a tactical fps, youll die less, and every kill gained will be a significant accomplishment. and the size of the maps...oh my gosh! theyre huge!! theres nothing quite like jumping in a helicopter and performing a night op with a friend over the many, many kilometres of island terrain. oh, i hope you have a powerful computer, because youll need it to run arma 3 in all its glory.",41.9

"amazing military simulator, all the console peasants are jealous their peasant machines cant run a game as good as arma.",344.2
"verdict: good reasons: on its own the game is a small disapointment from what we would come to expect from bohemia. stating this i would like to mention that the game is not even close to being a bad game the standards where just set very high. the game allows tons of mods about all kinds of things. this game is nothing near cod so you cod fanboys that do nothing else than cod please dont ruin this game for others. overall the anti hack system is prety good. this game requires a lot of team work so dont even think about being a stingy player it wouldnt benifit you. im not the best in reviews but i hope this helped someone",640.6
"after the recent update most of the desync was gone, marvelous work. 10/10 would crash the vehicles again.",709.5
"pile of , biggest waste of money ever. it should be illegal to sell a game as broken as this for 45 mother ing euros. 5/5",15.3
"amazing game!, has many things to do and have never been bored playing. full of cheap dlcs you can easly spend 50+ hours on this game, for what it costs its worth it!",595.8
"this is good, i like it, it lacks some basic things like female character models and some articulation of the current models, but its a vast improvement. the big problem though. i have liked the arma series for a while so i got this in early alpha. now, my friends want to play it but $50? did bohemia sell out or something? it doesnt even feel fully finished yet.",120.1
"great game for hardcore gamers cant wait for what more is to come in this game",31.9
"question to the game makers: if i bought the lim addion, should i have all the dlc?",179.2
"love this game! has a good gameplay with a good graphic,really worthed!",207.7
"as all arma games they are hard to figure out the controls but bieng the next step after the most realistic game in the world its understandable.arma three has greatly improved its campaign after arma 2s rather terrible one arma #s is actually worth playing.when it comes to multiplayer in a arma game there is nothing like it ranging from altis life(role play) to conquoring the whole vast 270 sq kilometers of altis.i would definately recommend this game to anyone that has a computer that can handle it.nomatter if you have the recommended requirements or not as you can imagine this game puts a load on computers.",273.6
"having owned this since the alpha, i can say i highly recommend it. this beautiful game brings not only fantastic single and multiplayer modes, but stunning graphics as well. it has a much better optimization than arma 2, but is also more graphically intensive due to being a newer game. modding community is very developed and mods are plentiful. breaking point mod highly recomended for those who enjoy dayz. all together an amazing game and a huge step-up from arma 2.",287.9
"very good so many things to do i would deffently recommend this game!!",176.2
"great game especialy the mood atlis life and dayz lot of fun and realistic behavior on multiplay",87.4
"one of the best combat simulators ive ever played!!!! the modding community is wonderful and supportive! this is a must have!",110.5
"this game lets you have the freedom and creativity to make/play the battles your way. this is not for the casual gamer nor the gamer who gets easily frustrated - most likely caused by the ais complete stupidity and the terrible damage models. however, this game is stunning. the lighting, shadows and texture quality really push any pc to the limit. i could go on about the bad points, but its the good aspects of this game which really sets it apart from the rest. if i had to give it a score out of ten - 8/10.",46.7
"ive got to say, arma 3 is one of my favorite games. the base game is fun by itself, but the real fun comes in when you play wwith mods. arma 3 provides you with wasteland (survival teambased mode), altis life (an rp), breaking point (working dayz sa), and multiple more. this vast amount of solid content shows how good of a game it is.",219.2
"just finished the main campaign, it was pretty fun and challenging.",356.9
"great game. imo, more realistic than arma 2, better graphics engine. i was able to run it in 1600x960p. recoil is not that of a damn barrett .50 cal when you are shooting a pistol. cooler story and just overall an advancement from arma 2. op af",12.1
"its fairly rare for me to write recommendations in general, and its even rarer for me to find a game that ill keep coming back to after the 100 hour mark. arma 3 is definitely one of those games. im in no way saying its finished mind you. there are some occasional bugs, and sometimes the ai is really  or has laser rifles that pistol kill you from 1000m away (not so frequent anymore) but for what it offers, and what can be added via mods, this is one of my all time favorite games. if you have even one friend playing with you, youll have hours of fun. its really unbelievable how much you can do, and how much you keep coming back for even after frustrating encounters or missions. theres something for everybody in arma 3 (theres even a fishing mod for all you nonviolent pansies.) and it really provides a framework for you to do what you want with it. in all honesty, i am hard pressed to name a game that allows you the ease of introduction and ramps up to advanced techniques so smoothly. the more you play, the better you get (obviously) and ultimately, you decide how and what you want to play. the game goes on sale occasionally, so id wait til then, although i bought it full price and never looked back. its one of the very few unfinished games that i dont regret buying.",392.9
"while i love the arma series, this game was not was i was expecting. when you make a game, you have a couple things that need to be set up to make it a game. 1. a setting - they created the island, and it was good, very large and open with a diverse landscape 2. the engine - everything works well, even the physics, which arma 2 completely failed at. movements are fluid, you got way better animations, so there arent any complaints....until 3. weapons and vehicles - this is one of the most crucial points to add variety to a game, and i am sad to say that bi failed miserably. they created virtually nothing for the games release, for what reason i dont know, but it aggravates me to no end. you have all the things in place, the tools for people to make their own missions, but there is no variety, same guns, same ammo, and a couple of vehicles. look at arma 2, even without the dlc, there was tons of content to work with, and the dlc just added onto that. my advice? keep up to date on the status of the game, and once the first dlc comes out, then buy it",41.2
"this game is an amazing follow up to the second arma. a huge graphical improvemet, ui changes, and weirder keys replacing inventory with gernade, yeah that was fun to find out... another thing that makes this game amazing is the steam workshop, it adds, litteraly, hundreds of mods, missions and just fun things to do!",106.6

"this is an awesome game!! really realistic. so far everything that i could want in a shooter and more.",448.5
"this game has the most hardcore roleplayers ive ever seen. nothing quite like it.",131.7
"this is a great game i recommend it to all my friends. reasons why: it is fun !, many possibilities, online gameplay, many updates, cool gameplay, great campains and lot of weapons and cars. fun to play and really sweet graphics! only one thing.... they must make more maps!! stay aswome arma iii !!",366.2
