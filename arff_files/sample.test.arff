"i have played every version of this game since it came out. like any crack addict, i was compelled to buy knowing the risks. hell, i even upgraded my pc just so i could play the game properly because the last two incarnations just wouldnt work on my battered old machine. there are always problems when it first comes out. ive found that the problems persist until a patch comes out in december/january. now for the breakdown: good - the user interface is so much better; there is more interaction with players; you can force moves out with a gentle discussion - a great innovation. bad - whats going on with the tactics? i was scoring plenty of goals, but i noticed that i was conceding far too many. maybe it was my tactical setup? so, when i went into a 3-0 lead, i decided to shore up my defence. i dropped my defenders back and even my wingers. yet, once again, i was conceding the same sort of goals - a cross into the box and finished because my full back was somewhere else or (more usually), the goalie making a save and the rebound always falling to their striker. the end result was 4-3. my stats showed i had the tallest team in the league and thus scored most from corners. however, i also conceded the most from corners. wtf?! i developed one tactic where i gave up trying to win away and just park a bus. still a 5-2 thrashing. i won the league scoring over 100 goals. i conceded more than the relegated teams (70). despite brilliant fitness coaches, i was losing to loads of last minute goals. why, god, why?! i love this game and always will, but to get most enjoyment, ill wait until the patch.",317.2
"i love the football manager series ,this game has potential but it has some serious teething issues and needs updated. the high score lines and players getting injured every game is very unrealistic and not up to usual standard. ive been playing fm since the start and was put off by the mix reviews on here but decided to try it for myself . i dont understand how people can honestly enjoy or reccommend this game in its current state? pros- looks good and performance is fast. new interface is good and easy to use once you get used to it. scouting has been improved. cons- far too many injuries ,at least one per game leading to a selection crisis. no matter what team or league i pick. far too many high score lines, 4-4, 6-4, 7-5 , 4-3 , even against lower league teams. goal keepers are slow to get up after a save. defending is poor/non existent no matter what team or tactics you deploy , i have yet to keep a clean sheet. far too many goals from long range against you. far too many goals conceded from crosses. one game with everton vs new england revelation i had 30 shots on target and scored 2 goals. they had 6 and they beat me 6-2! its not very realistic and what i expect from a football manager game . i can put up with the high scorelines, but the constant injuries is infuriating. no matter what team or league or the set up in training etc , even the reserves seem to pick up injuries . you shouldnt have a selection headache due to injury a few games into the season. it has potential but im only a few hours in and these issues have put me off. i expected to be lost in the game and have 20 plus hours gameplay by now! i simply cannot reccomend this until they address the issues.",38.8
"ive played every single football manager game since the split from championship manager and every single championship manager before that and i have to say, this is the first time ive been massively disapointed in the series - it doesnt feel like fm, its a skewed imposter. some things around the game has improved in subtle ways - match day stadiums looks great, the scouting is more realistic than ever but the good ends there. the matchday engine has slowly become a joke over the years, tolerable but still worsening for the past 3 editions, this one being the worst. injuries are through the roof in this version (even after the hotfix tweaks) and its impossible to keep a players fitness up even with squad rotation. in addition to the injuries the goals are insane your team will score 100 goals a season with anichebe as your main attacking threat but youll also concede just as many with neuer as your keeper. tactics dont seem to matter all that much, after testing it seems the main factor is your familiarity with it. if its low youll drop easy wins without question as your defenders refuse to perform any type of tackle. in all i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone in its current state and i really hope si throw out some massive fixes/improvements and soon.",79.7
"its decent installment again but nothing much is new. i paid 35 bucks for this and just upgraded from the beta to the full game and i dont notice a single difference... everything still is as shady as in the beta :( this just wont stand... it means theyve probably had this game ready for ages since the changes are just graphical mostly and want to hussle us as much as they can. of course the engine / card / injury system is messed up on launch as usual too ffs why do i keep falling for their scummy tricks... i cant recommend anyone buying this now, get it for 15-20 bucks and after a few patches and maybe then its a decent update. (had to choose thumbsdown until the state of the game changes, then my review might change too) edit: just got a crash dump error for the second time as well, im done with this till they patch it, back to fm14 it is sigh :( edit #2: the only thing fixed are the crash dumps, i no longer get crashes but the match engine is still so random and terrible that i dont even want to play no more. edit 3: 20/12/2014: almost winter and this game is still a mess, you can lose to the number 18 of the league with your best eleven and then 3 days later win against a stronger opponent with your b-squad for no reason at all. si should be ashamed of themselves.",443.5
"ive bought this game for many years and think this might be my last. firstly im not keen on spending 30 a year on something that could be released as an update. the lack of competition in the manager genre has made si very lazy, to the point where they make one or two small changes and market it as a new game. here are some of the points where my problems lie -ridiculous injurys, in my first season there was not one point where i didnt have at least six players injured -how many times in real football does a team make all its subs then a player gets injured and they finish the game with 10 men? well in fm about one in three games but amazingly never to the computer opponent -its almost impossible to generate any momentum anymore in fm, you will be playing well then suddenly lose for no reason -football has always been in the headlines for footballers astronomical wages, thank god its not like fm, youth players who have never made a first team appearance asking for 40k! agents of average players asking for 5mill in fees! -instead of improving things like the ability to see how your players have performed in training during the week to help your decisions on who to play si add tunnel interviews?!? i can imagine the meeting at si so what have the fans on the forums been asking for well their all desperate for more press interviews in the game, they just dont feel theres enough as fans of the series we should treat si like an alchoholic relative and not hand over money to them to continue their bad habits, in this case their bad habits being treating fans like cash-cows that they can just make sub-standard games for and rely on fan loyalty",237.9
"this is the last time i will ever pre order fm!!!!!!! this game is just garbage. if ur a devoted footy manager fan like me u will hate this game. i am currently managing birmingham city i am 16 games into season and i have scored 35 goals and have a goal difference of -6 so thats 41 goals conceded, the team who are top have scored 22 goals, what a pile of junk. cottrill scored six in six all free kicks. i mean iv almost scored double the goals of most teams and conceded treble the goals of most teams. instead of waisting your time trying to fill the game to the brim with unwanted bull**** like media and trying to replecate emotions just spend a year making a match engine that works. im angry i have pre ordered this rushed out piece of junk and will never spend my hard earned money on this game untill i see that u get the basics right.",150.1
"played football manager since its inception in 84 on the zx spectrum, this is one of the worst in the series for multiple reasons. the devs seem to have the notion of more is constantly better whilst getting the fundamentals of the game which always stood it above the rest completely wrong. i have thousands of hours in football manager games and never been compelled to write a negative review. although playable is not great, the series has gone downhill the last few years in my opinion.",117.7
"this franchise had been in decline for a few years now. fm14 had absolutely terrible defending, and the problem still isnt gone. this is especially clear in lower leagues, where its rare to have a game without at least 4 goals. the match engine does look and work better, in most aspects, than last year, but at the end of the day, the scorelines are still ridiculously unrealistic. the 3d engine is still extremely bad graphically, but whatever, 2d classic is the way to go, i mean it would be, if not for the unrealistic results. i havent played a really good fm in years, and this is not one either.",114.4
"as much as i love the franchise and the previous releases, this one just doesnt do it for me. its a horrible game atm.. realism; non existing. its basically fm14 with a sidebar, more time wasted on annoying interviews and an, if you can belive it, even worse match engine (the worst one so far in any fm game imo). it has the potential to become a great game, but it needs so, so, so much work that i dont think si will be able to pull it off before the release of fm16. im not going to recommend this game right now, but if there is a god then it might be worth it to check back in 2 or 3 months to see if anything has improved. cheers..",141.2
"not saying this is a bad game not at all. i have played football manager since 2012 and know the game in and out. now this is the most fun football manager. but is the most fake as in a season only having one 0-0 game where i play defence with counter attack still does make for an interesting season. having 127 goals and 58 conceded is interesting to watch as well do not get me wrong. but this is the most unrealistic football manager they have put out. its a joke how many goals go in and how much is just plain unrealistic. example first game in the prem just got middlesbrough promoted playing against liverpool games ends 8-6 .... 8-6 !!! how does that happen? if you want an unreal intense football manager where it is all goals goals goals then this is for you if you want a football manager go and play the last year and just download a mod that updates teams for you because this is not a football manager. pros  - a lot of goals - never a dull game - more in-depth communication with player and staff - in match team talks - better transfer and overall balancing - always fun most game end with a min of 3 goals - more goals goals !!! goals for every one - being able to speak to a player who does not want to come instead of being blocked by agent gives more scope to get players out of your range cons  - very unrealistic - random injurie spells (not always but can end up having 9 players out for 3 weeks after 2 games and two weeks of training) so always save and quit when this starts as when it does the injuries will not stop until you cannot field a team - no matter strategy you will score a lot and concede a lot - could still have more depth, i still think it has got too streamlined from 2012 - players seems to get very unhappy fast and all seem to being a stubborn as a mule unless you use the talk ( x player is having good form) no matter the form they seem to agree with you - having a one 0-0 in a hole season and 3 strikers with more than 20 goals and top 6 goals scores in the league all having more the 30 goals kind of makes it seem very unrealistic - german league rights have gone and still no badges for most top flights teams ( mods do fix both mind) overall for people wanting fun 7/10 people wanting a football manager 3/10",76.4
"im a fifa manager guy. however, as it has been discontinued, i had to move to football manager. a friend taught me the ropes, and ive been playing for a while. i played with liverpool, ac milan, bayer leverkusen and atltico madrid. no game has gone to mid-season. i studied, researched and spent a lot of time talking with friends about this game. i wish i hadnt. this is just the worst manager game ive ever played for a simple reason: nothing you do matters. i bought marco reus and alex oxdale-chamberlain to play on the wings. might as well have kept the money for myself and used emile heskey and djimi traor there. the most skilled player cannot dribble past the worst defender. the best crosser of the ball cannot beat the first man. the tallest and best header cannot score 3 goals a season from crosses. every team play the exact same way, and most goals come from the same three things: shots from outside the box, defensive mistakes and free-kicks. in upwards of 300 hours spent in the game, i dont think i saw a single goal from a corner. however, three times i saw a goalkeeper handle the ball outside the box and get booked, and two of those free-kicks resulted in goals. players are so unbelievably stupid that its annoying. steven gerrard to take a free kick on the edge of the box. you think hes going for goal. no. hes going to pass it back to the left back, who will then try to dribble and lose it. you think asmir begovic is a good goalkeeper? well, hes not above handling the ball outside of the box when trying to boot it upfield. id always been told that football manager was all about the tactics, and that it is the hardest thing to manage. well, it is hard. specially because no matter how you set your team up to play, they will always play the same way. you can try to get the best passers of the game, but they will misplace at least 30% of their 6 yard passes. this is so frustrating im at a loss for words. injuries? well, hows this for a list. before the third match of the season, i had the following players injured: steven gerrard, jordan henderson, alex oxdale-chamberlain, alberto moreno, john flanagan, marco reus, adam lallana, daniel sturridge, asmir begovic and mario balotelli. thats before the third match! all of those players (bar lallana and reus, who are injured at the start of the season) got injured during pre season! seriously? unless this game is heavily patched to fix everything thats not just wrong, but plain dumb, ill be forced to stop playing a genre i really enjoy because ea were not competent enough to keep fifa manager going, and because sega apparently have no clue what a football match looks like. ill wait and see. but i will not hope for much.",641.2
"well well, where do i start.. upon reading reviews of this game (largely negative) i was very cautious on purchasing this, but i still did as i love fm. ill start with the positives, i like the new interface, it makes it much easier as everything is in front of you in one screen rather that lots of drop-down menus having to be opened. it also looks alot smoother and i like having world news opened up in a tab after skipping a day which means i wouldnt have to subscribe to other teams and leagues or some players. negatives? hold your breath because this could be a long one depending on how much i want to type. i have played three competitive matches with my team oxford united and here are the scorlines: 4-2 burton (w), 1-5 wolves (l), 6-3 mansfield (l), thats 8 goals scored and 13 goals conceded in three games. outraged enough as it is. i saw lots of people reporting situations like a large amount of injuries, the high-scoring games, players with apparent mental and physical disabilities, too many own goals.. well, in those 3 games i had expereinced all of these things. during the match against mansfield alone i had an injury (my 6th in total including the 2 i started with), my right back halting mid-run unchallenged then leaving an opposition player to score 1 on 1, and then two own goals just to add to my misery. who knows i may just be getting all the rubbish out of the way early and the remainder of my entire fm15 career with be rage free (yeah sure, good luck with that son), but in my honest opinion do not buy this game if you are capable to rage and wait until it is cheaper/there has been a patch which sorts this out. come on guys, wake up. this is poor. if the in-match experience is improved then this would be a good game and i will go back to my usual fm addictive binge playing until the early hours of the morning, but i will not be playing until there is this patch, whenever that is..",203.2
"oh boy... where to start? the pros? the game is so in-depth, detailed and looks great that at first glance you feel like you are in heaven. unfortunately, the absolutely ridiculous ai and randomness of the game ruins it for brand new players and seasoned veterans alike very quickly. i have played football manager games since the 1990s. i have bought every game in this football manager series. i have probably tens of thousands of hours of experience playing these, and have thoroughly enjoyed every fm yet. until this fiasco. i have only played this one with two teams, man united and sheffield united, but the experience has been identical. the game is so damn unrealistic, that it will suck the life out of you. these are actual situations that happened in my season with man united. a month into the season, i have lost nearly third of my team to long injuries. some players cannot put together two games in a row before returning to the injury list. not totally out of the question, but highly unlikely. queens park rangers finished 2nd in the epl in my first season, while tottenham and liverpool barely missed relegation. i finished 9th, and got fired. i kept beating the top teams repeatedly, while collapsing at home 0-5 to teams like qpr and swansea. i lost 5-0 to a 9-man manchester city, after winning the shots 14-5 and hitting the post/crossbar five times. frustrating, but not impossible. but scenarios like this unfold throughout the season; the likes of rooney and mata cannot score regardless of opposition or their position on the field while james wilson bangs out a 30-goal campaign, you can literally have a guy of van persies stature standing on the 6-yd line with an empty net and hit the post over and over again, and dont even get me started on these phantom goalies... you can be playing against a backup to the backup goalie 2 divisions below yours, and fail to score, while the opposition sinks 3 behind de gea on three shots. i scored 2 or 3 goals from direct free kicks all season, and maybe twice from a corner. my opponents? you got it, somewhere around dozens. now, it might sound like im making excuses and dont know how to manage. but as i said, i have enjoyed these types of games some 20 years, whether i win or lose. why? because the games have been as fair and realistic as a simulations sports game can be. sure, there will always be that crazy 7-5 home win against some world class team, but when it happens once every 150 games or so, thats pretty okay... there will always be that game where an underdog takes you down and leaves you extremely frustrated. but guess what, it actually happens... what doesnt happen are the scenarios i discussed above, and after some 150 hours into fm 2015, i feel like i have enough personal experience to call this game total garbage. fortunately, fm 2013 and fm 2014 are still installed on my computer, and still offer limitless hours of fun and entertainment. do not waste your money on this game, play the older installations and wait until sports interactive gets their crap straight. a major major disappointment.",148.7
