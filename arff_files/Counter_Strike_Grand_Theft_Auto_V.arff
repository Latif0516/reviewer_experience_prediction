"this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review, because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counter-strike. here you go: i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game. i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it. a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house. when i saw the counter-strike logo i was filled with gamegasm (?) and i was so happy. i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then. so, the journey started. i was playing it hardcore. made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. counter-strike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience. playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. in a pleasant way, ofcourse. shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. sometimes the most simple games like counter-strike are the ones that live to this day. also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. the gameplay is very simple - defend as a counter-terrorist, attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct. i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counter-strike, so i am sharing here more of my experience. i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008. so, i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago. i think counter-strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today, if this game wouldnt exist. i am sure many of people already have played games like cs:go, but never the roots. i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from cs:go and modern games. i am glad that i lived through the golden era of shooters and if id have to rate it, itd 10/10 ofcourse,",1440.5

"cs is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. it is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. it is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in. it starts off with a team trying to kill another team. i started playing cs when i noticed jacking off isnt the only activity to do on a computer. i started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. i wanted to play every chance that i could. on my road of cs adventures, i encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as i was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasnt a lot of fun. then i discovered that i could sign up for a class with dboorn. i was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. sure enough, i was proven wrong. we started off by practicing a little bit. then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. i made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course. when i play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. only i, the mouse, and my teammates remain. we are united in a common goal. we strive collectively towards an end we all desire. each player has a spot to hold. they stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. thus, cs celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. when i play cs, i play until my veins pump battery acid, and then i play some more. cs is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. what destiny might you ask? i spoke before of unity. and it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. that is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. one machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. not that these small metal objects are actually animate, im of course speaking only metaphorically. over the course of the years, i have increased in skill, but i have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. i have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. even if that team is less than ideal. i have realized that cs is about more than just ones athletic ability. instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the ak, the awp, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). and more importantly, the teammates at my side. i love them. it is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness. in conclusion, i love cs. i love to win. i love pushing myself to my physical limits. its that feeling that first drove me to the computer. for every second that i am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. a thirst that grows as every minute passes by when i am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. i had an extraordinary time playing this game, and i will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how i used to feel. this review may be over, this game may be dead, but i will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).",6059.0

"counter-strike: ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, i have finally quit counter strike. counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great fps game that anyone can enjoy it. its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. the huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. with this games ive met so many different people and unique friends. this game is literally g(old). to all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, i highlly recommend on this. ive got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike in tottal,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... great game. gg wp. and too all the people who will keep playing this game, all i can say, as always, gl & hf <3",507.9

"its a real legend .. legend of pc games",20.4
"this game is unlike the other counter strike games. this game requires a different type of skill. you have to become used to the recoil each weapon has. you also have to become familiar with the different advantage points of each map. i personally think this is the best counter-strike game.",65.7
"this game appears to remain no. 1 fps action games since 2000 for around 8 to 11 years. it is a intense game as your health and your exposure is important as well sticking together with your team mates at all costs. you should maybe try this game and learn the routes in common cs maps like dust or assault. go on try it! however they are a several downsides to this game like the weapon nerfs like the recoils and smoke grenade failing to detonate airborne and the lame tactical shield. and cos this game is so popular that thousands of servers host this game online, that some pc criminals tend to take advantage on players like using hacking or server addon hacking materials. so you maybe best to stay clear of weird or dodgy servers with extreme adult material and steam cannot unban victims who got hijacked and vac banned, so please be careful! but if you are old and wise enough to handle this intense action game...buy it, soldier!",172.8
"i dont like because steam blocked redirections from server to server. i know that people using it to slowhack, but now... servers with redirection are unusefull.. also, vac not working good for counter-strike 1.6. maybe it could be good for some update, or something... i can give you anything you need for it. contact me. kinds and regards, drag1c.",650.1

"first of all its my first online game ever. i was very young and i was playing with my friends lan matches sometimes for fun sometimes with bets the loser treats refreshments. xd this game its the reason that i maked my mum to buy me a pc to playing this game at my home. with the time i learn how to modding on cs 1.6 servers,plugins and more stuffs about pc. after this i learn how to aim on the enemy head, how to fire inside the walls, how to hear someone with his steps and how to fight!!! i have played many fps(first person shooter) games that they called me hacker of my fast killing. i had so fyckin good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never. for others its only a game for me it was my life! this wasnt a review but a little story. so counter-strike ftw es!!",2998.1
"a still alive first-person shooter, since 2000. the game that changed everything, along with half-life. still, the best first-person for thousands. and you know why? because this games focus isnt on graphics. its for having fun with your friends, or, even aim for world turnaments. all proffesional teams, such as fnatic, navi, sk, still play counter-strike, doesnt matter if it is 1.6, source or global offensive. highly recommend this game.",1959.1

"counter-strike was an amazing achievement. a free mod for the original half-life that outshone its parent game completely and become becoming incredibly popular, so popular in fact, that it was sold it stores as a individual entity back when it was still free to download for anyone that already owned half-life. nowadays a mod turning into a full game is almost common place and happens sometimes even without the popularity but back then, it was a monumental accomplishment. counter-strike managed to become the most played pc shooter of all time and even to this day boasts both a strong competitive scene and tons of active public servers. how many other online shooters can say that their online community is still alive and kicking 12 years down the line? the game itself i never really cared much for, i played it back in the 5.2 beta days and although there is something to admire about the simplistic purity of its gameplay this has never been the kind of game i could really get stuck into. the developers tried to introduce a number of new game-modes back in the beta days but quickly found that trying to complicate the game would only leave the players confused and unsure of how to proceed. counter-strike is a simplistic teamshooter but it is a milestone in gaming history and one that we should be happy and proud of because counter-strikes simple existence is the reason why modding turned mainstream.",733.6
"greatest game ever.",448.7
"yeah... the old counter-strike.... everybody know, what cs is.. counter-strike - my rating - 9/10 why or why not to play this old classic ? positive: its a legendary game, and if u playing games like cs:go etc. u will like it, cause it will be legendary in your library. almost everybody played cs 1.6 from start his cs:go career counter-strike 1.6 is latest and best version on the game, and if u purchase cs, u can play it, if u will download it, theres is some chance, that u cant play it (win 8 etc). most of legens/pros in cs:go played cs 1.6, its like beginning, and it could be your beginning! negative: no more good tournaments on cs 1.6 (on cs:go are tournaments like ems, dreamhack etc.) graphic+gameplay - graphic sucks... but its still better then warz:p gameplay.... yeah, crouching sucks, aiming sucks... u know... bad gameplay, if u see cs:go, when is all so smooth, u will hate cs 1.6... but if u play cs 1.6 before then cs:go, its good for you, and u will like it (probably:d) so... my opinion is: its legendary game, everyone, who likes fps must have this in his/her:p steam library. :)",27.1

"counter-strike is probably one of the if not the best fps series ever, and it all started from this humble beginning, counter -strike 1.6 is a down right one of the greatest classics. it still holds up today, thousands of people play it everyday, this community has not weakend from 1999 it has gotten stronger, and it is 2014! the competitiveness and skillfulness of cs is so much fun, and no other game can even capture a mere smidge of it. this game also still has competitive servers still today, unlike the newer cs:source which just have casual servers that are only on office and dust 2. on 1.6 you can find nearly every map (including moded maps), and nearly every game mode (even moded game modes). cs 1.6 still holds up today and it is still so much fun, i give 1.6 a 10 out of 10.",17.9

"counter-strike 1.6 is a great ing game. what makes this game great is that i can write a review for it in one paragraph, completely summarize everything that is included in this game and still fully recommend it to everyone. this game is the most generic shooter at first glance, but after your first few weeks of cs 1.6 you quickly realize that this games aesthetic simplicity only encourages more community map development. and when you really begin to play more of cs 1.6, you realize that the shooting mechanics and first person mechanics of this game is anything but simplistic. no other first person shooter feels just as a smooth as a valve first person shooter. and the amazing mechanics that are in this game are backed by an amazing community of players who will never leave cs 1.6 behind. the maps such as, dust2, inferno, and nuke are built to such perfection that they will suck you into the game as if you were in a modern militaristic tron. the gameplay is pretty similair to that of its opponent (cod). search and destroy is completely influenced by cs 1.6. only downside i could think of is that really the only weapons that are worth using are the ak, m4, and the awp. all the other weapons are left behind. in my opinion counter-strike 1.6 is a strong 8 out 10. its a total classic.",83.0

"im not one to criticise a game but, this has to be a great title mostly for its your role affects your teams success. your teams success affects your role, system even if it had many problems. the gameplay is great with plenty of user created content to play. vanilla gameplay is not advised as it gets repetitive fast. overall gameplay is a 8.5 out of ten. the sound isnt very good with its annoying tracks, the only way to fix this is to download custom gun sounds but thats a pain. the sound wasnt even good in 2000 when the game came out and thats telling you something. overall 4.0 out of a possible ten. i know this is odd for me to review a game off of this but online community. the community if few and far between, there are barely any good servers up and sometimes the community is awful. (still not as bad as team fortress 2 imo xd) overall 6.0 out of ten. graphics usually take the backseat in my reviews but, i do have to say the graphics are ok i mean in 2000 they still werent as good as unreal 1 or idtech 3 but they get the job done. overall 6.5 out of ten. my verdict is that this game is good and still is i have to say this is a damn fine game earning my score as an 80% out of 100% (btw this is all criticism because, i am a critic.) (i go into detail about every problem a game has.) therefore i recommend. monstercat signing out.",34.2

"so if you are a counter strike player from india there are chance i hate you . the game is amazing , the first game i ever played online , i had fun since i came to more depth ,in indian counter strike community . lets start from cons : 1. too many servers .people floods with spams. 2. hackers , people normaly play with illegal copies of cs and use hacks. 3. admins there are people who are  and people who are admin in cs indian servers . the  scored a 2/10 score in test and the admin scored -10/10 due to the  and useless ban they does. my cs got destroyed so many times cause some dense admin thinks i was hacking (you play nice you must get punished destroy cs -admins). not all are dense thou. 4. the community calls each other pro it may not be a bad thing but it is really annoying when you see people calling each other pro everwhere even your social life gets destroy if you are connected in a counter strike group tons of spam useless ban and demo for hacking and all. 5. wallspam in map like de_dust2 (which is played mostly) there are so many wallspam people spams a entire magazine in wall in hope for kills . not once or twice but always you cant move from that place ever . 6. the community is bad way too bad . and more. now the pros 1.gameplay cs requires gameplay i knew some player who were worth calling good or even a professional level player.they had the skills 2.mods were allowed in servers . jail break was my most fav mod in cs . and there more like zombie mod. 3.the game is competitive in everyway . 4.there are few tourney for amature player to earn some money. its hard to see games this old still is successfull . 5.maps are well made not talking about custom maps which are worse (in my opinion) some custom maps are good but majority are worse. 6.the recoil is kinda hard to control this makes the game hard for noobs who spams bullet hope for kills . 7.there are many more pros to this game . no doubt one of the best game i ever played . still if you are an indian cs player i hate you .",178.9

"the greatest game out of the older games. this is why it is still going after so many years. this game contains lots of modifications including different maps to download for your server, different skins for your weapons and even fun mods like dodgeball or zombies! this game is certainly worth its full price and it does deliver the entertainment that you are looking for. of course as it is an older game the graphics will not be compared to call of duty or battlefield 4, but the graphics should be the last thing that a person worries about and you have to look at the level of the entertainment of the game. counter-strike definitely delivers that entertainment and that is why you can spend so many hours on this game.",1237.8

"this game, is not a multiplayer game, is the multiplayer game. this game is classic, is a monster! counter-strike... i love those words. this is my 2 favorite game of all time. to be good in this game you must be a strategist, to have a good team relationship, and takes dedication. this game has tons of weapons to choose. the game modes are perfect, the other community gamemodes are even better! you like cod with zombies, well, this game haved zombies before cod, and better zombies. in what game are you gonna do a deathrun, where you must be alert to everything and to have skills to survive and kill a terrorist? in what game are you gonna kill zombies, while they run at full speed and all your teammates throw granades and shoot as if there was no tommorow? in what game are you gonna surf on wall? in what game are you gonna find this quantity of maps, and good maps!? in what game!? battlefield and cod can have better graphics, destruction, campaing and more guns, but, they will never have the community that counter-strike have. we made counter-strike, counter-strike made us.

"heres my story, i went over to my friends house one day, he was playing cs. i tried it for myself, i was instantly hooked and have been for over 10 years with the counter strike franchise. best online action franchise ever for the pc in my opinion. counter strike is like a drug that you will never be cured from, trust me.",0.6
"a great game!!!",4225.3
"1999 is when this came out, but when i was born. gladly though i grew up to find out and discover about this magnificent piece. there was no other game that i played once i purchased this with some b-day cash on steam. first time playing, i got mutilated like the noob i was, but when i started playing more often, i became better and everyone else can too. this isnt like the cods or battlefields that i have played here and there today. no its much more different. counter-strike is a tactical fps which relies on teamwork and tactics more than fast paced arcade action. you dont unlock weapons, you buy them with cash earned from kiling enemies, completeing objectives, or winning rounds although you still get a little for loosing. think of the game as cops & robbers. robbers blow things up and the cops dont them too. on the extra note, this game has probably one of the best modding communities out there. there too much to do or put in here but i can slam a bit down. -zombies survival/escape -soccer (or football for the europeans) -surf -bhop/kz (climbing zone) -pokemod -gungame (those new may have heard such from call of dutys spinoff) -and more, etc. so now that ive explained the game i guess i can lay down some pros yet cons to playing counter-strike 1.6 pros -fun/unlimited gameplay possibilities -booming community that has been alive for 15 years -plethora of servers to choose from -competetive and casual at the same time -fun to play with a group of friends -more skill based than many other games out there -cheap price cons -graphics from 1998 may seem slightly offputting -not an easy game to jump right into, as it takes lots of time to become better -may seem repetitive after a while i came into cs late. but, im glad this was the first one i owned.",253.8

"this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review, because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counter-strike. here you go: i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game. i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it. a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house. when i saw the counter-strike logo i was filled with gamegasm (?) and i was so happy. i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then. so, the journey started. i was playing it hardcore. made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. counter-strike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience. playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. in a pleasant way, ofcourse. shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. sometimes the most simple games like counter-strike are the ones that live to this day. also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. the gameplay is very simple - defend as a counter-terrorist, attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct. i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counter-strike, so i am sharing here more of my experience. i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008. so, i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago. i think counter-strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today, if this game wouldnt exist. i am sure many of people already have played games like cs:go, but never the roots. i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from cs:go and modern games. i am glad that i lived through the golden era of shooters and if id have to rate it, itd 10/10 ofcourse.",44.2

"this game still continue to live on, but why was that? well it was quite due to that fact that cs:source isnt that much like by the pros since 2004 as cs:s as quoted: too easy and such, so the match for cs 1.6 grew more and more and that it was so hyped and praised and good, it still have matches even after 10 years of its 1.6 release (2003 - 2013) in which just kind of died out for cs:go, but still, because of its core gameplay and the fact that the commuity has been long just playing this multiplayer long and long and long, it is a game that will take long to die out, since it has a strong community base for it. since this game has been, well for long, then you should commonly see the use of wallhacking, cheats, aimbot, fake servers been used today, and the fact that there are quite a lot of empty servers now, but there are populated servers that are good and good community, but there are part of the community been off ever since. it is seem a bit late to just buy and play this game, but it is still great to check it out if you are new to the cs series, or otherwise if you dont have gnu/linux (in which i have), then you can buy counter strike : globle offensive anyway, since it is newer and (i think) has more players and pros playing it now. but if you want to have this raw action, then cs 1.6/cz would be great, you can get the bundle too if you want source as well, but source is fun to play as well. verdict: 9.5/10 - it still holds it place.",93.9

"counter-strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously. the objectives vary depending on the type of map, and these are the most usual ones: bomb maps: the terrorists must carry a bomb, plant it on one of the designated spots and protect it from being disarmed by the counter-terrorists before it explodes to win. the counter-terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. hostage maps: the counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages held by the terrorists to win. the terrorists win if the time runs out with no conclusion. vip maps: one of the counter-terrorists is chosen to act as a vip and the team must escort this player to a designated spot on the map to win the game. the terrorists win if the vip is killed or if the time runs out with no conclusion.",1131.8

"counter-strike... this game is the reason to why i got a steam account in the first place. i got this game six years ago from a near friend of mine. everytime i was at his place we used to play this together in turns; he played for a while, maybe 2-3 deaths then i played. we had such a great time. but... the problem was that outside his house we couldnt play the game together. at the time my dad didnt allow me to buy the game, so my friend ended up giving it to me as a christmas present. since that day we played it all the time. one of our favorite servers was eropid (hs only). he (my friend) ended up beeing in 4-5 place for a while on the server. overall, ive had a great time playing this game, and still enjoy playing it today. the game was the start to my fps gaming interest and since then ive bought every cs released. i recommed this game to anyone who wants to start play fps games; as it is a great starting game. i also recommend that you play it with your friends; that way you will get the most fun out of it! thanks for reading, and enjoy! - nit",343.7

"the original counter-strike, is a game one cannot forget. albeit having 3 successors, the gameplay of the original is incomparable. the title number 1 online action game was truly deserved during its glory days. that said, the game is tactical, and the guns handle close to real-life counterparts. either you plant a bomb, defuse a bomb, defend hostages or try rescuing them, theres also a few deathmatch maps, but the tactical/competitive gameplay is a lot better. if you find yourself struggling to get kills while revisiting one truly legendary game, try condition zero, as its quite useful to understand the mechanics in the counter-strike franchise.",86.2

"best game known to man-kind. no enhanced engine captures the reality of this original. 1.5 was even better. per. head-shot boxes have never been the same and since vac i miss seeing the cheaters getting caught red-handed and added to the international blacklist. i still keep a black book of every ip at the scene of any crimes. if you want to experience the original awp trying playing op4. shoot opponent in the hand or foot and they are toast! if you are still mad that they cliff and whoever took the silencer off the colt i got the sob back. visit antpla.net to get skin pack ii. original was from ~01 and is still downloadable as general sphinx brothers of steel bos skin pack. i was there playing uks ganstawars last man standing gameplay type messing with the bots skins trying to get cs skins on gangstawar bots and enjoyed how one of them was invisible. sort of like a prank. if you can tommygun invisible opponent you are like a luke skywalker bad a$$. skin pack ii has the starwars lightsaber replacement for knife and the ak to plasma rifle from 1980s movie alien. the skins out compete csgo any day of the week with 400fps instead of stuck on 30 same kernel. i got a duo-core up to 1200fps. well i should not have shared the knowlege with other gamers on the map because next thing you know everybody was doing it on their own character. [au] deathwish settled it when it got to cs with rainbow coloured animated reskins instead of them being invisible. my first game was cs canyon_siege and i was wondering why we all were moving around as ghost spectators. i am not the prodigy inc sphinx. i have only made auto-admin called 3 forms of punishment. it was for admin mod then re-written for amx. lost. no need for it anymore anyway. people still found a way to hack with it and fly around the maps prior to hook and vote for matrix, etc. give them enough rope and instead of being slapped, killed, kicked, ban was in effect for short period. essentially you mixed 2 words with lag and server and other various buzz words like gay server all these got punishments set fourth. talking crap about admin was a slaying. lag was a slap. it was based off trinity and the server was the spirit. if trash talk is about the spirit, that is not forgivable or rather as tolerated and the ban was automatically set. that resolved major breach of security. suddenly there is no need to have tons of admins. most of whom were there just to exploit code often unintentionally, due to buggy 3rd party plug-ins such as statsme.",3270.2

"best game known to man-kind. no enhanced engine captures the reality of this original. 1.5 was even better. per. head-shot boxes have never been the same and since vac i miss seeing the cheaters getting caught red-handed and added to the international blacklist. i still keep a black book of every ip at the scene of any crimes. if you want to experience the original awp trying playing op4. shoot opponent in the hand or foot and they are toast! if you are still mad that they cliff and whoever took the silencer off the colt i got the sob back. visit antpla.net to get skin pack ii. original was from ~01 and is still downloadable as general sphinx brothers of steel bos skin pack. i was there playing uks ganstawars last man standing gameplay type messing with the bots skins trying to get cs skins on gangstawar bots and enjoyed how one of them was invisible. sort of like a prank. if you can tommygun invisible opponent you are like a luke skywalker bad a$$. skin pack ii has the starwars lightsaber replacement for knife and the ak to plasma rifle from 1980s movie alien. the skins out compete csgo any day of the week with 400fps instead of stuck on 30 same kernel. i got a duo-core up to 1200fps. well i should not have shared the knowlege with other gamers on the map because next thing you know everybody was doing it on their own character. [au] deathwish settled it when it got to cs with rainbow coloured animated reskins instead of them being invisible. my first game was cs canyon_siege and i was wondering why we all were moving around as ghost spectators. i am not the prodigy inc sphinx. i have only made auto-admin called 3 forms of punishment. it was for admin mod then re-written for amx. lost. no need for it anymore anyway. people still found a way to hack with it and fly around the maps prior to hook and vote for matrix, etc. give them enough rope and instead of being slapped, killed, kicked, ban was in effect for short period. essentially you mixed 2 words with lag and server and other various buzz words like gay server all these got punishments set fourth. talking crap about admin was a slaying. lag was a slap. it was based off trinity and the server was the spirit. if trash talk is about the spirit, that is not forgivable or rather as tolerated and the ban was automatically set. that resolved major breach of security. suddenly there is no need to have tons of admins. most of whom were there just to exploit code often unintentionally, due to buggy 3rd party plug-ins such as statsme.",3270.2

"counter strike is a game that will be in the gaming history books for centuries to come. it is valves turn in the competitive scene and this is their weapon. counter-strike. stupendous game which has proven to many gamers that gameplay, strategy and quick thinking comes first and graphics second. unique because of the ability to completely control the recoil of your weapon. astounding as pretty much all the maps are beautifully designed, even now i appreciate the creativity, the player and modding bases allowing for some of the best content by the people, you to create. the gun mechanics are by far the best seen in any game i have ever played. the way the guns fire and flow syngerize and play so well, its almost mad why they never copied this to css and csgo. planning rather than rushing is another reason. you never know what terrors come across. counter strike is no longer updated but however is still alive and played by most of europe, where small teams and clans are still existing to this day. veterans also still play this game (i dont play comp on this but i have met and played with players totalling 3000 hours on it, which is insane, inspiring and completely awesome!) the game itself, is in no way glitchy or bugged and is in fact, for a better word for it, near-perfection. valve will be remembered in the glory that is counter strike.",180.3

"this will be more of a my experience with this game type of review, because saying things like great gameplay will not suit something ive experienced with counter-strike. here you go: i remember back in 2002 i was at a friends house and he was playing a game. i didnt know the name of the game nor i had internet to find it. a few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didnt have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. he told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment i knew that it is going to be the game i saw at the other friends house. when i saw the counter-strike logo i was filled with gamegasm (?) and i was so happy. i dont remember a day when i was so happy like back then. so, the journey started. i was playing it hardcore. made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. counter-strike is my first game which i played competitively and it was a whole experience. playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. in a pleasant way, ofcourse. shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. sometimes the most simple games like counter-strike are the ones that live to this day. also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. the gameplay is very simple - defend as a counter-terrorist, attack as a terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a ct. i am sure most of you already know this and i doubt there are gamers that havent heard or know the gameplay of counter-strike, so i am sharing here more of my experience. i wish i could find my cs anthology account which ive lost since 2008. so, i decided i am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. i still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and i sometimes even stumble upon people ive played with years ago. i think counter-strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldnt have many games like we have today, if this game wouldnt exist. i am sure many of people already have played games like cs:go, but never the roots. i doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because its much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from cs:go and modern games. i am glad that i lived through the golden era of shooters and if id have to rate it, itd 10/10 ofcourse,",66.5

"the sum of years of work put into designing something the devs were happy with along with the community (back when the community wasnt composed of reddit and casuals).this game has a good design in general. its very simple, very clean, and thats what makes a great game. there are some small things i could whine about but for the time it came out and even now, these things arnt huge issues that could frustrate me like the issues in the newer iterations of cs. this is cs. its a damn good game that you have to play. its a shame though they abadoned pretty much everything about this game in go aside from the fact you play on t or ct and buy guns. only problem is no us and english speaking players. which pretty much ruins the game when you dont want to hear third worlders and their monkey screeching.",17.5

"a great game of cat-and-mouse where you either play as a terrorist (plant bombs or hold hostages) or counter-terrorist (defend bombsites or rescue hostages). either complete those objectives or kill all players of the opposing team to win the round. counter-strike is a fast-paced, realistic shooter that encourages teamwork so play with a friend (its also more fun). the graphics hasnt aged well but the guns still looks authentic. one thing i hate about counter-strike is when you die, you have to sit and wait until the round ends. even if the rounds are usually short, its frustrating and it puts a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive. fortunately, counter-strike has tons of mods available so youre able to play the game in many different ways. this helps the game from becoming repetitive and keep the game fresh. theres also not a lot of detail in the sound, other than the guns, but thats a minor complaint. the mods, dedicated servers and competitive nature of the game is what holds this game together to this day and thats why millions of people still play this old-school game. although there are many better shooters on the market now, counter-strikes unique gameplay is what keeps me coming back from time to time. 8/10 - great game!",41.0

"counter-strike, this one also known as counter-strike 1.6, is a team-based multiplayer realistical/military shooter. and a very well known one at that. it was first available as a free mod for half-life 1, being patched regulary up to version 1.6, until recently it got its way onto steam, as a serapately sold title. so, how is the player base? counter-strike 1.6, being popular self, has an active player base. you will see many servers, up to 32 players. at very least there are many russian servers, as it had a cult following over there, cant really see past them. on bad side, most seems to prefer terrorist plant c4 mode and then de_dust2 is the most played map. a lot of servers run small mods, that may alter balance or other small things. and most of it, playerbase had a lot of time to play and master this game, so new players will be more frustated than having fun learning. counter-strike is a very well known realistical fps. it gained its popularity while being free mod for popular half-life, because it provided something else what wasnt overused yet - realistical shootouts (using models of real weapons, you know) in team multiplayer. unforgiving and furious. or unbalanced and twitchy one-shot kills with headshots. whichever one you prefer. counter-strike has two types of map. first, de, is a mode where counter-terrorists have do defends few market spots on map from terrorist. one of the terrorists spawns with c4 in inventrory and has to bring it to one of the marked spots to plant it adn start to countdown of ts victory. roles change as terrorists will have now to defend this place from cts, whos aim now are to defuse the bomb, in which case cts will win the round, no matter how many more ts are left. pretty interesting mode and most played, otherwise this game would have been camping fest. and if one site is too well defended, ts can go to another one. and then there is a second type, cs, in which cts have to to rescue hostages by bringing them back to base. the problem there, is that hostage npcs arent perfect (though good enough) and since cts have to rescue them all, terrorist can camp in one of the spots around them, since cts will have no choice but to come to win. much less played and even if it does, it goes like your everyday team deathmatch, just killing all of opposite team. much simpler anyway. now, the core gameplay... there are few rounds. each round starts with each team spawning on their side of map. there is no respawning during round, once person is dead he is out, so you will have to worry much more about getting insta-killed. there are no items placed on map itself either (on correct, official maps), no kind of medikits. in spawn place, you have 15 seconds to press b button (or whichever you set) to bring up buy menu, where you purchase weapons and equipment for the round witht he money that you earned so far. yep, when round ends everybody gets some sum of money to spend, with winning team getting more, an ingenius design decision that helps losing team to get steamrolled even harder. what you can buy there is a pistol, primary weapon and any of the equipment. (yep, if it doesnt smell like prototype of modern military shooters) once past purchase screen, you are free to run and shoot. and here comes the art of recoil and aiming. for you see, one of the more important thing that is used in this game is accuaricy of your weapon. if you move it drops. if you jump, it drops. it drops while you are shooting too. thus it becomes more importanly to get good position, making assaults more compilated, and you often have to relearn to shoot, making few clicks instead of just holding down mouse button. you will have to be often walking instead of running, to keep accuaricy while moving (it also makes you silent, so do it often), or just stand and crouch sometimes. burst shooting is better there and for long range targets you want to be just click few times. another important thing is that you can shoot through some walls with more powerful primary weapons. so dont be surprised for people shooting through door, walls and even just over the corner, it indeed does small damage to whoever is behind. the game also emphasises aiming because it supports headshots and they do a massive damage. and you also got three kinds of grenades. explosive (he), which explodes, good for throwing into chokepoints. flashbang, which blinds whoever looked at it when it blows for few seconds, quite annoying but good for stroming into room. and smoke grenade, when you dont want enemies to see you coming and dont want to be under direct fire, good for open spaces with snipers (who instakill you when you peek around corner). protip: you run slightly faster with knife out. and well, while on theory it sounds interesting, as well as empashises teamwork. here comes the downfall of the game. the weapons, while make people with gun fetish happy, are badly balanced around each other. there are just best and bad weapons. from pistols desert eagle is the best, they behave as backup when you got no time to reload primary weapon. shotguns are theorically good for close range but in this game they are useless and assault rifles can kill even better at close range. sub-machine guns category had advantage of no accuaricy drops while moving, but are still inferior to rifles. rifles category has two best guns: all-range assault rifle like ak-47 and all-range sniper rifle like awp (which doesnt even require headshot to one-hit kill), exactly what majority of people use. the only machine gun is pew pew pew cant hit. and all-range is all-range, random is random. you may run and shoot in general direction of enemy and pull off a headshot from your ak-47 by luck. or you may walk around corner, thinking of your next grandious tactical plan, just to get headshotted in insta-second by guy with sniper rifle from close range. its just so full of cheap and frustating, the rage is probably the main thing that keeps players coming back for more, not honest fun, as well as luck of possibly pulling few magical headshots. slow-down when being hit doesnt seem to be good idea either, making it harder to get away from the choke points. and random spread is not actually random, it just randomly follows one of the pre-set pattern. and yes, if you will learn them, you will be able to control your shooting better and get on top. exactly what puts apart newbiews and elites, and exactly what elites seem to boast about when they want to say that counter-strike 1.6 is the best because it takes more skills and time to learn, with artifical challenges like this one that makes little sense. and well, once you spend your time to learn them, you will still find out on top that it didnt make the game any more amazing. but you know, its not too bad. it does teamwork well. sometimes the game just works. when you work along the team, round the corners and storming the next room, where you follow teammates, supporting each other. provide covering fire to the corner. when upon entering next place, each one covers his own direction, as some of the rooms just have too many places from which enemies can shoot you (smoke grenade and flashbangs help in these cases). and its pretty damn nice at those moments, until they get ruined by something stupid, something you dont feel like could be prevented. yea, getting shot by sniper. and yes, this game has good enough sounds. no music, sadly. the graphics are quite hl1 high-definition era, but otherwise are fine enough. the levels are a bit of bland though. cant really recommend it. because everybody who will like such games are already playing it. and player base of this game had too much time by now, that they will be just way too skilled for new players, who will just get destroyed and it will take a long time to get onto same level. its not like there arent enough military/realistical shooters anyway.",19.1

"counter-strike: global offensive is the current iteration of valves top-in-class competitive shooter, and the first to be maintained in the very modern way it has been. learning from its experience with team fortress 2, valve has a miniature economy in cs: go that revolves entirely around gun decals. players get a few drops a week after matches, which can be a gun decal or a weapon crate  the latter of which cost 1.49 to unlock with a one-use key from the store. obviously this economy is tailor-made, and so there are extraordinarily rare and mysteriously fantastic-looking gun and knife skins (with prices in the hundreds of pounds), then a large range of other skins tapering down to the common-as-muck variety that trades for pennies. i dont pay much attention to the cs: go economy as a whole, though its interesting enough, but its important for a non-player to understand that a big chunk of the games audience takes it very seriously indeed. in the days after a new operation launches countless forum threads are launched about the value of the new goods, whether someone should sell this new rare drop they got or hold it for a while, twitch streams with giveaways and 50 crates being unlocked and so on. you get the picture. i give such context on cs: gos economy because  even though it is a subsidiary part of the game to many including myself  it is the molten core of operation vanguard. cs: go is a regularly-patched game but the major updates come in the form of operations that introduce new maps and new skins, at the price of around 3 for an access pass  with the nice touch that maps are available to all players regardless, or made so shortly afterwards. to give an exhaustive history of operations would be no more useful than a general overview. if you play counter-strike then the chances are you play a lot of counter-strike. what the operations do is freshen things up a bit  naturally they dont disrupt the regular dust-mirage-inferno cycle of competitive play, but you get some unfamiliar environments to tool about in, the chance to score some fancy new weapons, and in the context of a game you play almost daily, 3 a few times a year is chicken feed. operation vanguard is different, and the changes are not for the better. the first problem i have with it is major: the way its sold seems to skirt the borderline of deception. to participate in operation breakout you bought an all-access pass for 2.39. to participate in operation vanguard i bought an access pass for 2.39. the difference is obvious side-by-side, but of course when ov popped up in counter-strikes home menu i bought it more or less instantly, thinking this was the same thing. ovs selling point is two campaigns, a series of missions with three branching paths. the missions are things like win 16 rounds on map x and kill 20 chickens in deathmatch mode, and completing one bags a pre-determined award  either a weapon crate or a random weapon from a specified collection. so far, so ok. but in fact ov has two more campaigns, both of which cost 1.79 to access  which follow more or less the same pattern. to be crystal-clear about this, the money is not the problem. im happy to pay for operations, and ovs combined total of around 6 in the context of the time i put into counter-strike is really not an issue. but that switch from all-access pass to access pass (with the right to buy more access), just pissed me right off. first of all i felt conned. i bought the ov pass in the same way id bought all the previous operation passes, expected it to be the same deal, and realised id been fooled by the removal of all. secondly, what the two extra purchases offer is basically a re-skinned version of ovs mission book. but thirdly, and this is the real killer, youre encouraged to buy them to self-medicate the most egregious, enormous, climactically wrong and frankly offensive design decision in vanguard. there are multi-day cooldowns on missions. thats right rambo, you may have thought you were buying another set of missions and drops to liven up day-to-day business in cs: go, but in fact vanguard is a campaign designed to play out over a set period of time, with the only limiting factor a bald external one: cooldown timers. let me set the scene for you. i love counter-strike. i saw vanguard was out on a thursday, and cleared friday night. got in a few beers. booted it up and bought the pass. i played the first mission, cleared it in about 15 minutes. chose a second, the killing chickens one, and that was another 15 mins. so around half an hour into my evening of joy i was given a four-day cooldown for the next mission. you can slice this any way you want, but its . the sad thing is i get the thought process behind it. consider: youre valve, in charge of a game where players (a) want new content but (b) put in so many hours that theyll rush through anything almost instantly. for example, mission chains. operation breakout introduced missions in the form of random drops, which parcelled them out over time but had no larger arc. it was fine but the missions never felt important. so operation vanguards missions are in structured patterns, with defined rewards, and are given the desired longevity through simple brute force of timing. you will not complete this content before we say so, because you cant. oh, except that if you buy the extra mission packs, your cooldowns decrease across the board, because now youre allowed to do more missions in a set period. thats right. youre basically paying to reduce cooldowns. in a valve game. the thing is that operation vanguard is only a campaign in the same way that a pile of biscuits is lunch. the missions are basic objectives like win 16 competitive rounds on season or get 100 famas kills in deathmatch mode. and what do you get for completing them? either a drop from an existing collection of guns, with a minor chance of a rare gun, or a weapon crate. the first is fair enough, but the second i mean, at this point i already felt pretty rinsed by operation vanguard, and now its rewarding me with crates that i need to pay more money to open. there is a school of thought that says valve has done this in order that a flood of new crates and mission rewards doesnt flood the in-game economy, instead trickling them in over the coming months. to that argument the only appropriate response is  who cares? i play counter-strike: go because its a great game, i dont play it because of the economy, and while i accept the latter is how valve makes money, the moment it starts intruding into the game  if indeed this explanation holds water  then the economy is not acting in the way that it should. that is, it should be improving the experience rather than throttling it. the sad thing is that operation vanguard comes with my favourite selection of community maps yet, including two in season and back alley that feel like potential classics. yeah theyre all over the place in terms of favouring one side or the other, but this is par for the course with cs: go and will be tweaked over the coming months. every cs: go operation freshens the game up with some new environments if nothing else, and the point of operation vanguards structure is to elongate this beyond a few days  to really showcase these excellent maps by forcing people to play on them semi-regularly for missions. it at least manages this. i want to emphasise that im an enormous fan and c",0.6

"let me start off by saying that the counter-strike pack is a stand-alone product. you dont need the original half-life to play this game. in the retail package you get a full version of cs as well as team fortress classic, opposing force multiplayer, and the wanted, redemption and firearms mods. the entire pack is overflowing with multiplayer fun, but, of course, the real focus of the retail release is counter-strike. there is a single-player component to cs and, while it provides a good primer, this mod is all about online action. you basically play a game of cat and mouse, with the mouse being a terrorist group and the cat a squad of counter-terrorists. as a terrorist, youre goal is to plant a bomb at a specific location or hold a group of hostages. as a counter-terrorist, its your duty to defuse said bomb or rescue the ill-fated hostages. taking out all players on the opposing side will also assure your victory. cs is an action lovers dream, with games lasting only four or five minutes (if that in some cases) because, unlike half-life, one shot to the head can mean instant death. cs is the perfect mix between fast-action and realistic damage. you cant just absorb bullet after bullet and expect to walk away. working as a team is a must and, while youre in the game, taking the lone wolf approach will often get you killed...and fast. its the team-based tactics that make cs so fun. i cant stress how important it is in this game to act as a team. if your team is on the defensive side youll all benefit by creating a cohesive strategy. if you team is on the offensive side, you will all benefit by sticking closely together as well. im sure youve seen movies or television show demonstrating this conga line style of infiltration. well, thats exactly how your team will have to act. this creates a fantastic game balance that will keep you coming back for more. itll also keep you from thinking about your school work, your job, and interaction with your loved ones, and often work around the ign offices will be put on hold so we can clog our network with cs. visually the game will not disappoint. while the half-life engine isnt the prettiest beast out there, there is plenty of animation that creates a smooth look and feel, and the gun models are some of the most realistic looking of any shooter available. the environmental textures look realistic enough and complement the provided camouflage well enough for you to be hidden, but not be invisible. as in real life, the distinguishable difference between good guy and bad guy is a little difficult, but the balance to this is if you cant tell who it is then you probably wont be able to hit him with your gun. now, if youve purchased sniper rifle, you should have plenty of scope magnification to tell the difference between terrorist or counter-terrorist, but otherwise you may be taking out a team member from afar. as good as it is, a couple of features of this game really stood out as frustrating... at first. but over a period of time they actually became enhancements to online multiplayer gaming. one feature is buying your weapons at the start of each round. this takes a little getting used to at first since, in most shooters, you just run around picking up weapons at your hearts content. usually by the time you figured out which guns, grenades, and armor you were going to take in your early games, the bad guys would come over and kill you. but a couple of tries later, after getting the gist of things, youre off in no time. the other feature that took some getting used to was the wait and watch feature after you get killed. once you sustain a lethal injury, you have to wait for the next round to start before you can join in again -- you dont just spawn again and start shooting. this actually adds a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive and completing your objective. but like i mentioned before, the rounds are short, so you shouldnt have to wait too long before you can jump in the action again. not surprisingly, the user interface is very half-life-esque. gamers who have played half-life or any of the other mods for the game will have no trouble with the menu system. even for the first time user the interface is easy to use or fumble through. the only thing that even slightly tripped us up in the interface is the update on the server page. first-time users may be confused into thinking this meant update my version of cs. not true, it actually means update the list of game servers. but the rest of the interface is easy to understand and even easier to navigate. just about the only aspect of this game that we could make negative comments about is the sound. sure, the realistic guns sounds are spot on, we just wish the same amount of attention to detail was given to the rest of the sound in the game. some levels have lighting and thunder. when the thunder crashes it sounds a little wimpy. we were hoping for some deeper bass and clearer sounding claps from the lightning. in most of the level the user can go inside or out side of buildings, the sound of their footsteps should also change to reflect what type of surface they are walking on. the sound of footsteps getting closer and closer could also have been improved. as it stands now, its hard to tell how far down the hallway or street a bad guy is from you by sound alone. so how long does the magic last? well weve been playing this game for over a year now and we still cant get enough of it. are we tired of it? hell no! were still surprised by how fun this game is. this game actually made some of us squeal like little school-girls after getting sniped from an unexpected angle on high. on the other hand some of us were drawn to stand up and scream obscenities at the monitor. i guess well just have to get them next time! in a nutshell, if youre looking for the next step in online first person shooters, then look no further. cs is fast paced, intense, and satisfying--this game will not disappoint. this is truly one of the best mods for one of the all time greatest first person shooters ever, and the retail package of cs is simply bursting with multiplayer goodness. if you like to play shooters online, get this pack!",88.1

"the classic shooter upgraded with modern controls: counter-strike was something unseen, yet highly needed in the late 90s and early 00s. it carried with it the idea that you didnt need a single player story mode to make ripples in the video game industry. as future competitors would attempt to reflect, all cs needed was an incredible skill-based gameplay with a start-of-the-art ability to play against players from around the world. toss in some alternate gameplay styles to help break up the chance of monotonous moments and throw it all over a large assortment of levels for good measure; youll end up with a dish that, for years, has been best served with a dedicated server and a good group of friends. its no wonder that cs gave birth to some of the best online team play the world has ever seen and continues in that tradition to this day. if you havent played the original counter-strike yet, youre missing a small part of your soul... hurry, go get it back by quick scoping with an awp down long a on de_dust2.",453.0

"first at 8 years, since in 2007, a friend comed at my house and installed me a cracked version of counter - strike 1.6 . well i played it like one thousand hours , my friend moved in other country, and when i was playing someone destroyed my cs. i didnt know how to install it again, so i watched on youtube ,i reinstalled it again, that story with the destroy repeats like 2-3 times. i started to be an admin at 10 years, yes 10 years baby, i was doing requests to be an admin and i was telling them i was from 15 to 25 :d well servers that i was an admin closed , get to the next one , when this closed , to the next one and like that. i always knew that servers close because there is a lot of money to pay to have one. at 12 years i discovered steam. the first year i didt have any friend on steam because i haved a  laptop and i was not able to play call of duty 1 on 30 fps. i continued to be an admin on servers. 1 year ago i discovered an server that i love, i have some great owners that are very nice, and some day the owners decided that the admins need to buy counter-strike 1.6 . i dont planned to buy cs 1.6 on steam because i already have it cracked , but i loved the server so much that i buyed it on steam! i think that i have like 5000 hours of play with cracked css :) i totally recommend this game! 11/10 love cs 1.6! <3",33.2

"counter strike is an first person shooter that was released in the late 90s. whats it about? well counter strike is an online first person shooter where you either play as an terrorist or an counter terrorist. the terrorists objective is to transport a bomb to a bombsite located on each map marked as (a) or (b). whilst the counter terrorists main objective is to stop the terrorist force from planting the bomb. theres also a gamemode where the terrorists will have hostages and the counter terrorists objective is to rescue the hostages before the time runs out. game ends when the counter terrorists has saved all hostages or the terrorists has whiped all counter terrorists. is it worth buying? since this is an really old game and the graphics are really outdated compared to the games we have today i would still say this game is worth buying. the game is over 15 years old but still has a alot of active players and playing with friends make it even better. counter strike also has alot of maps, mods and other stuff that makes the game better in any way. graphics. 7/10 sound. 8/10 gameplay. 10/10 this review is based on my own opinion and noone elses!",68.2

"welcome to the worlds most fun over rated pile of . since i first got a pc nearly 3 years ago all i have ever heard is counter strike, counter strike, counter strike. and, after about 15 hours of play time i see why. right away i can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fps/multiplayer genre and i can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike, its nonexistent learning curve. for the first maybe 3 hours i played on a few different servers and never killed a single person. i figured im new to this and it seems as thoe these guys/girls have been playing much longer than i have been so i began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later i had killed maybe 6 people, not much had changed. and then remembered that thats stupid, i shouldnt be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while i have 5. another problem is the weapons i can understand the weird names, valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesnt mean i wont still make fun of them. the damaged ratio is also complete . the sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and i was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast. the knife is a bit under powered but thats better than it being a light saber. and for some reason the only guns that are ever used are the ak look alike the m16 look alike and the sniper rifle. i should say that counter strike is not a bad a game. its for sure a sextillion times better than any call of duty ever made. and i will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends adhd kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy. but its also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat.",28.0

"this is by far one of the most fun online shooters ever. if not the best ever made, and in my opinion the game that pretty much started the genre. ive been playing the game off and on since its release and still to this day it never gets old. the game runs really good on modern pcs and its really a game that when your doing good you really feel a sense of accomplishment. plenty of fun maps to play on, plenty of servers to play on, plenty of customization options. this is one game that you can really taylor to suit your style. plenty of user created skins for your weapons that can really make this game look amazing. and i still prefer counter strike over counter strike source. i dont know, call it nostalgia or whatever but there really is something about just good ol counter strike 1.6 that is just simply magical. it truley is a classic in every sense of the word. and still is just as enjoyable (if not more enjoyable) then any online shooter on the market today. so glad i got to grow up with this game. i would definitley recommend it to any fan of competitive online first person shooters. come join the fun.",299.1

"ive played this game since i was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever i launch it to this very day. over 12 years of endless entertainment. no other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than counter-strike 1.6 has and i doubt no game ever will. reason ive only got 38 hours here is because i no longer use the account i originally played cs 1.6 on. func_vehicle is what makes this counter strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise. find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world. you can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. do i need to say more? mods on this game are amazing too. there is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. call of duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on... there is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles. 1337/10",96.8

"game of the year simulator. if youre thinking about buying a game and you dont have gta5 you basically need this game. beware you need a pretty fast computer to keep up, the game is cheap in comparison to what you might need to spend to get it running but i can play it on a radeon hd 5870 1gb without much fuss so the fact that it can run on 2009 hardware is pretty impressive. no complaints in the optimization department. i must say, the pc options are fantastic. there is a lot of tweaking to do, especially in regards to the controller and keyboard settings in addition to the expansive performance tweaks. my favorite part is having a keyboard and mouse and gamepad in front of me and when the game gets to an intense shooting part i can put down my controller and use the keyboard/mouse and start shooting without having to go to a settings menu and change anything. it just works. its perfect. the gameplay itself needs no introduction. you can do pretty much anything. even online play is pretty good, first time i played two guys were in an airplane and nosedived right into me while on foot and everyone died. 10/10",27.8

(hes my favourite character). grand theft auto: online multiplayer with a lot of stuff to do (if it works). game modes: free mode - my favourite thing to do in this game! deathmatch race (including standard, gta and rally modes) capture survival hold contend raid parachuting you can have fun killing civilians or just chill and ride your car around beautiful places (what i like to do). heists are additional gta: online missions that you can complete with your friends or with random people. its really cool and a lot of fun, you will probably enjoy it! so the conclusion is that you must have this if youre a pc gamer, as this game has almost everything (killing to racing). the verdict is a must have game that you will enjoy playing alone or with friends. as i said thousands of times, it is fun and epic! enjoy and have fun!",75.8

"april 14, day when i quit my job, april 14, day when gta 5 was released for real xd april 14, day when i stop having xxx <3 with my wife, couse game have so much thrill ! ok now about review : grand theft auto v is a spectacular third person free roaming game which does well in portraying everyones guilty pleasures, whether that is slaughtering innocents, exploding cop cars with rpgs, murdering hookers or taking a trip to the local strip club. grand theft auto has always been amongst the greatest free-roam shooters of all time, and it continues that legacy here with gta v. the online experience and racing have been greatly improved and the story features three playable protagonists rather than the traditional one. in the story of grand theft auto v, you play as three very different characters, with three different, distinctive personalities. first is michael, a retiree from the illegitimate business of bank robbing and a family man with tons of family problems. next is the young blood, franklin. straight outta the hood and looking to make a living without having to look over his shoulder every step of the way. lastly is trevor, the truly psychotic man with no regards for human life. everyone that plays gta v instinctively chooses a favorite character, whether it is michael, because you want to see him get his family back on track, franklin, because you want to see him create a future for himself, or trevor, because you too enjoy killing drunken rednecks. regardless you must play as all three, and the greatest feature that separates the campaign of grand theft auto v from all others is the bank heists. plan and execute heists, whether you choose stealthy or an all out blood bath, choose your crew which ultimately decides the payout you receive from each heist and enjoy every detail and heist you can. the story is well worth the price of buying the game, but it comes with an added bonus. gta online. although gta online had a rocky start with several issues, it is for the most part fixed today, and a very fun experience to play with friends. in the beginning their were terrible servers, problems involving created characters being deleted and now the mission payouts being much lower than early release, and replaying them pays out even less. along with most others, i am still awaiting for heists in multiplayer, which very well may never come, but regardless gta online is still fun. you still have the ability to run around and kill others, as well as civilians, but instead of that simplicity, you can now customize your character, his vehicles, and even where he lives. you earn money through online missions and other methods that helps you pay for newer vehicles, apartments, weapons and clothes. you create your own character and literally choose his skills, which you can later improve. grand theft auto always has great replay value, gamers still play san andreas and gta iv, and of course, several thousand still play gta v. after the story is over, you can always free roam, and when you get tired of wandering aimlessly, the multiplayer is great to play for long periods of time. gain satisfaction improving your vehicles and purchasing a high end apartment. i only have one little note about this game, not for kids. seriously, if you are even the least bit immature, or offended by violence, language or sexual content, please do not buy this game, and dont buy it for kids either. a great game but its worth waiting for, especially if it will traumatize you, or turn you from innocent, into a kid that spews foul language. overall a masterpiece. rating 9.6/10 visual rating: 10/10 audio rating: 10/10 story rating: 10/10 playability rating: 10/10 replay value: 9.5/10 multiplayer: 8/10 written by golden members ; epic gunner and zemunbre please do subscribe if you liked this review there will be more to come ;)",72.2

"played it for a few hours on pc. i have to say i definitely prefer it on the pc over the console version, it seems to run much smoother, looks nicer, the controls are easy, driving is definitely a huge improvement compared to gta iv where that was just awful all together. rockstar definitely proved me wrong, after the amount of rage i went through on gta iv and how much of a crappy pc port it was along with all the buggy video editor errors, all of that seems to be fixed in gta v pc with a tidier video editor and less buggy overall. oh and no more gfwl! yes! well done, rockstar. definitely worth buying.",15.9
"this is one of those games that nail that sweetspot of rp [roleplaying] and the perfected multiplayer that is in gta v. personally in these games i go for that and its typically hard for me to find games that are like this that my friends and i enjoy playing. gta before [so gta iv] hit the perfect spot of relying on the community of mods to keep it interesting and multiplayer which was fantastic. i think in these kind of reviews its important to mention its predecessors and judge them to see exactly how far they have come. gta iv was fantastic but abit buggy alot of glitches to be exploited and kinda fell short in that rp aspect as i saw it. pros: -alot more to do in the terms of role playing and in terms of multiplayer alot more for the player to strive for which is a key aspect in keeping a player immersed and infactuated with a game alot of the reason why skyrim and such are still so played - the multiplayer is done really well no ports or anything to have a server just for you and your friends to screw around in - roleplaying has that optional feature that it isnt necessary to have rely on like in skyrim. there is that feeling that you can have it with friends aswell the game is what you make of it and i love it - the asthetics are supremely adjustable more than alot, even most games have out there and helps catch the eye that just give you that itchy finger for screenshots - friends, if you have any this is a game that can just be played for screwing around in a sandbox feel and keep the game anticipating which most games dont do - the game literally is just for  and laughs there are some many things in this game that just make fun of other things in media which keep the game hilarious and fun to play - the story mode is well done but not alot of replay value and is fun just for a story mode with good characters and voice acting that arent heard in every single game you play like troy baker as the main voice actor helps make it diverse - online and singleplayer are easy to switch to and from with easy access to players etc. - the ingame recording is a nice and good feature to have that makes the game feel a complete package which helps complete that 60$ feeling to a game such as this - pc master race> console beta testing cons: - public servers suck like public restrooms when you enter one you non-stop get killed and robbed, etc. and it seems that no matter what when you leave an activity you automatically enter one unless you set it to make your own private server - when you are in a public server when someone talks in it it goes across all the server there should be some limiting proximity to this because it is just plain mic spam when someone is talking. - the damage system for cars is kind of short cars give way super fast unless you buy armor for it [in about like 100 levels] which sucks and gives the feeling of buying cars just plain dumb - killing in the game is a bit realistic and a bit stupid a combonation of both which could be easily fixed when you shoot at someone they take about awhole round in anywhere but the head - cop are extremely accurate and actually do stuff which is good in the sense never do something bad or the cops will come eat you, but its done in away that if you do something like run over a headlight they chase you. this drags away from the initial feel of gta in my opinion - the  loading there are so many loading screens that take awhile to through even with the game optimzation - the game is the most demanding game ive played ever which makes it hard to have fun and not worry about your fps the whole time and that sucks major cohoanez (i run a 970 and still get 42 fps and some points) - game invites there are so many of them and that little ding that you get when you are playing sucks  cause its so damn frequent and sucks, i know there is the setting to pretty much turn it off but you cant from my experience when playing with friends with all of these pros they do outweigh the cons in the game in away that yes if you look closely at the game every second you will notice but otherwise if you play the game normally you wont most of the time. this all being said i find the game to still be fun with and without friends hours and hours of gameplay in and will proly delve hundreds upons thousands of hours in the game with friends, mods, and gameplay enjoyment. with so much to do and work toward it keeps the game perfect. this is a perfect game that was worth the wait and everything is lovely and asthetic as a hot girl in the sun.",132.2
"i couldnt enjoy this game on a console, but maybe its even better because i was familiarized for the first time with gta v on pc. the game is well optimized and polished, didnt notice many bugs yet, the graphics are stunning, even at medium settings. the gameplay is way more developed in comparison to gta iv and the story is promising to be very interesting. i dont regret any cent i spent for this game. totally worth it.",28.1

"ive been playing this game since day 1 when it came out, for 4 days straight, everyday for aprox 18 hours. in less than 3 days i finished the main missions and most of the optional side missions (game completion at 75%), without stealing more than 3 cars/vehicles in total (in the stats i have trevor with one police car stolen and michael with one firetruck and a taxi stolen, franklin didnt steal no nothing). i also played on the side online in that game time and reached a rank over 20, its great fun with or without friends. it feels like this game is a drug that stole my life...but i dont regret a thing. things i really enjoyed and you should probably do too: the game, despite its large size, its amazingly optimized with many graphic options to tweak. i have exactly the minimum requirements and i can run it, sure i had to turn every fancy pc enchanting option off and it looks like the graphics on the old-gen consoles, but i am happy, it works with +30fps. the missions are really captivating, the money spending system feels more challenging (because you have a lot to spend it on, to invest it, to simly lose it). you get to meet many interesting sidecharacters and the overall voiceacting is really good. besides the actual story and the many twists in the missions, they have quite a replay value due to their minichallenges for each of them (like finish in the required time, complete it in a certain order etc.) if you are a completionist. the car handleing, amazing, the gave up the gta iv simulator like driving and brought back the arcade like car handling from the older ones, where you can rotate in the air or do some nice stunts. the world is really immersing, each npc with its small story, with their interactions etc. its a living world filled with living people, animals and moments...and with internet, radio and cable tv! i cant quite say there is a lot of choice based tasks, but there is a really decent number of those, most of them involving planning or the interaction choice, but as long as you have imagination there will always be a choice. its great that we have animals, you can kill them, you can play/interact with them, you can even become them at a certain point (hidden easter egg). most of the people are avereage aged, from 20-60 or so, i kinda wished we also had the extrems like children or quite old people...sure it would probablly create some controversy, but it would make give the game an even more real feeling. and i could enumerate so many more...but now i have to get back to the game.",99.0

"for the first time in the series, characters now have a set of eight skills that they can grow over time. stamina, strength, stealth, and lung capacity are joined by a meter for their special abilities. these impact how long you can run and swim, of course, but also impact how well you handle recoil, climbing speed, take-off and landing in planes and helicopters, and so much more. if you want to bump up your flying skills, logic follows that you head to flight school. similarly if youd like to have a bit more stamina, then riding bikes, triathlons, tennis, golf and other physical activities will help with that. other than specialty skills, simply doing more of something makes you better at it  practice makes perfect. this is not an arbitrary add, but one with real. also graphically, grand theft auto v makes the respectable presentation of its predecessor look pretty bland in comparison. what a difference five and a half years makes! gone is the drab and depressing color scheme, giving players all the bright faux-california sun they can stand. having lived in los angeles, many places in the world of los santos, san andreas are familiar. the city itself is teeming with life, and i dont just mean random pedestrians and cars roaming around. people go about their daily lives: traffic backs up, downtown is busy, vinewood is full of shopping and mansions, vespucci beach has people skating and lifting weights, blaine county is far more rural with rednecks and pink flamingos, and wind turbines spin in the distance like the real-world san gorgonio pass wind farm. the whole place feels organic, looks the part, and is more like a living world than ever before.",34.6

"while the pc version of this outstanding game is new, its been out long enough on consoles that i dont need to go into every single thing about the game so ill just sum up what i personally like, (alot) and dont like (not too much). likes: -the environment an insane amount of detail has been paid to recreating parts of l.a. (l.s.) to near perfection. having been to the actual city several times, i could easily recognize landmarks and accurate streets while in game. the viper roorm, ripleys believe it or not museum, the scientology center are all here plus lots more albeit renamed but the structures remain the same. when the sun sets and rises, all of the lighting is accurate and at times, absolutley beautiful especially when the light rays are breaking around mt. chiliad and when storms roll through the desert or in the cities, its some of the best weather fx ive seen in a game because it feels real. roads gradually get wetter the more it rains and lightning illuminates everything when it crashes. it truly feels like a living world. -the satire what i feel is one of the strongest points of the game is how it shows no mercy towards the vapid lifestyle thats so prevalent in l.a. across all social classes. the rich are just as shallow as the poor in their life goals and in a very cathartic and some would say sadistic way, its never been more fun to mow down socialite trash in the hills or go on a rampage down in the ghetto. the signage and radio commercials are also perfect, knocking everything from politics to the video game industry itself. this can keep a person driving around just looking at billboards and movie posters and listening to the varied radio stations. -the characters there are many who dislike the characters, especially trevor and i can see why but i liked them because of how they played off of one another. michael, the would be retiree whos juggling family problems. franklin, a young man growing up in the hood, doing what needs to be done but also having some kind of conscience and a want to get out of his current lifestyle. trevor, the manic fiend throws all caution to the wind and is the vulgar but free spirit, taking pride in his insanity but also has some insightful moments along the journey. none of the characters generate any real kind of sympathy but theyre all believable and kept me wanting to play to see how things end up for each of them. the voice actors do an a+ job in bringing them and the secondary characters to life. -the first person mode not only is this one of the best 3rd person games ever made, its also one of the best fpss in years. being able to take in the entirety of the world and action through the eyes of each character really brings the world to life and the shooting is super smooth in both 3rd and 1st person modes. -the radio stations theres nothing like blasting through neighboorhoods or driving off cliffs while rocking we built this city by starship or heartbeat by don johnson. if you like pop, rock, country, rap, trance or even talk radio, theres something here for anyone to like. dislikes: -the police they seem overly aggresive and i dont know if thats a play on the lapd or not but there have been time that ive simply pointed a gun at someone and got swarmed by 4 cop cars in less than 5 seconds. also while in a car, ive been clear of their field of view with no chopper in the air and parked in the most secluded hiding spot i could find only to have them pinpoint my location and jump the walls to get me. -the storefronts i just wish there were more of them that could be entered and explored but i also know how much of a challenge this would be in an already huge world. id be happy if they would have an arcade somewhere with a few playable classic games. -the sub and the helicopter for me, the sub missions are the biggest weakness in story mode. the model looks cool but is just dull and not much fun to drive and thankfully main missions with it are few. the helicopter, while fun, could have the controls refined a bit more to make it more fluid especially when trying to pinpoint certain targets. thankfully rockstar is fairly lenient when it comes to this. -real time destruction again, like the storefronts, i know how much it would take to have this throughout the world and wed probably be lucky to get 10-30 frames per second with phys-x cranked up but it would be a sight to behold bringing down one of the contruction sites or collapsing an overpass at will. something about shooting a rocket at a building and only leaving scuff marks really removes me from the game in those moments. -extra activities given the sun and sand vibe of l.s.(l.a.), i wish that you could surf and skateboard. seeing a skateshop as well as a skatepark and half pipes and only being able to ride them with a bmx bike left me slightly gnashing my teeth. thats not to say they couldnt add these things in a dlc pack, (fingers crossed) but i just find theior absence strange and overlooked. those nitpicks aside, this is still one of the best games ive played in a very long time and, with so much to do, ill be playing it for the rest of the year and beyond and smiling the whole time. overall score: 9 out of 10",73.3

"great game with an amazing singleplayer storyline which is long and fun to play. there are many side missions and things you can do if you ever get bored of the main missions. you can fly planes, drive boats or just go around doing whatever you want. the multiplayer is so fun and there are so many challenges and different missions/heists that you can do with your friends or anyone you want. there is so much to unlock and so many different vehicles to customize. you can buy houses, vehicles, planes, boats and so much more. the heists which were only introduced recently are fun, challenging and great to do with friends. i would recommend this game to anyone especially if you have played the previous gtas this game brings together aspects from every game which you will notice. the map features things like grove street and mt chiliad from sa and other gta games. overall this game is very fun and great to play with friends or alone and i would recommend it to anyone.",77.3
"well since 17/04/2015 i was have pain in the  loading the game for 1 ing hour even it was horrible i just crashed and crashed over and over again and on graphics only thing that i can see is squares its like ing: minecraft 2 as party buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut its kinda fun to play if you play with your close friends you have so much fun without doing exactly nothing just sitting even when we come to phone or tvs they are actually animations and shows just like real life (but serously watch out watching these when i was exactly doing nothing but watching suddenly a woman voice sayed windmills kills birds and we shouldnt save energy and bla bla bla when i hear this i was like wtf then how solar panels kills the birds. if a 6 years girl/boy hear this he probaly turn into those who dont care about forests and the world so please i know its kinda funny you some of you think but serously dont even think about this) well another thing we can say is its kinda too much unrealastic beacuse of the fps for sure and i dont even care about 60 gb i cant even say something but some of you say even 10 gb is too much how we gonna download 60 gb oww?! well  you then we are not in a world that tech is too further if its easy to fit a game like gta 5 in 1 gb go and make your own  game second of all game is the best game ever we can count: graphics (if you have great computer that can carry on gta 5), game modes and many many more. but you know people just can die from 1 single pistol shot no matter what (im not counting those who has great strengh and does sports all the time they can die with 3-4 shots even if they are not wearing and armor but in this game you just fist fight each other and they just die from sprint and hit (like you ran and punch them in the face they just die not even 5% blood comes out and they just die from pain or what) and when we come to guns if you are away from them like 10m just shot over 5 times! they wont die (civils) they have and invisble armor or what when we come to cops they die from 3 bullets on headshot and over 13 times with body shot now wow even a real life cop can die from a 5 shots (if they are wearing great armor). now for the biggest thing of all for me: graphics : 7/10 shoting : 10/10 characters (single): 1/10 lester (why i even counting him): 10/10 multiplayer in a server with troll players : 1/1000000000000000000000000000000 ( no) friends server : 9/10 freaking characters on multi : 8/10 easter eggs : 6/10 (i didnt like those easter eggs much missions : 1/10 heists (much more better atleast has a adrenaline) : 10/10 62/90 (not counting multi  that) game is play-able for me",63.9

"amazing so far. great sequel to the series and finally on pc. running on a gtx 760 at 1440p. 4k looks nice, but fps drops to below 30. buttery smooth @ 1440p. radio is very entertaining. the map has definitely changed alot since san andreas, but there are still some areas that are very close and reminicent of the older game. cars handle alot better than gta iv. switching between characters isnt as bad as i thought it would be. im also a big fan of how the map is not locked down from the beginning such as all the other gta games. first thing i did after the prologue was boost a car, drive to the airport and grabbed the first plane i found and cruised around the map (dat turbulence). love this game so far. only played online for a few minutes and hit rank 3. lots of potential and really looking forward to continuing this game. 10/10.",32.2

"if you have your graphics driver updated to the latest version (no serioulsy nvidia has actually released a driver update specifically for gta just before it was released) and the settings at a level your computer can handle then youre in for a fun ride of stealing stuff, injecting marijuanas and really messed up stuff. not for prude or squeamish people at all. pc version is optomised really well which is really rare for a huge game of this caliber and it even includes settings for future graphics cards and i get a smooth 60fps at all times. thats until you start playing gta online, then you start getting conectivity issues and joining your friends or trying to make a private session is a nightmare. but youre still likely to have an great/10 time with the online mode just dont be a complete  to the other players and they wont start beating your  down for being said . thats untill you get to the online heists, then youll start praying for patches to save you from the crashes and the bugs that can never let you win a mission sometimes and the automatic mission failures for the game disconnecting another team member and the freezing of the screen thats sometimes fixed by pressing alt+enter twice but not really and the prison heist thats an absolute long boring drawl that builts itself up as a squeaking mission but is just rambo guns blazing at the end without telling you and leaving one of your teammates with a  pistol in the middle of a high security prison and the even worse connectivity issues and the issues where enemies can spontaniously go invisible and jesus christ i just wanted to have fun. fun is dead ;~;",70.1

"ive already played this game on console so the hours played are not correct... with that said. the game is way different from console. i mean... it is the same game. but it feels and plays much better. i max out the game and rarely get below 60 fps. if i ever do i get like 55 fps... not a big deal. so rockstar did a great job porting the game. it seems people are having issues logging in to the social club. i never had that problem. my friend did though. his steam name had a dot at the end (name.). once he removed that dot he was able to log in. it has something to do with the social club not working with certain symbols. the game: the story is crazy and filled with even crazier people. the longer you get through the game the more fun it becomes. i love the characters though i think rockstar did a much better job in red dead redemption when it comes to personalities. the world is filled with stuff to do so you will never be bored. if you somehow get bored theres always the multiplayer. ive not tried it yet on pc... but i can say the console version had a ton of variety in community made maps and game modes. i am sure the creativity of the pc gamers will outdo what has already been done.",19.0

"back in my mid 40s i had what any normal person has... a midlife crisis. i had an urge for adrenaline that i just couldnt get. i tried joining a triathlon, that didnt end well with my heart condition. i tried smoking weed for the first time but nothing really happened and my whole house smelled like pizza, i tried being extremely racist to black people in order for them to assault me but the only thing that happened was that they dismissed me as crazy and continued on with their day. one time, i remember, i even tried cocaine but to no avail. i simply wanted a rush, an experience, something that would send my heart racing (yet not overboard). i wanted adrenaline. on a fine summer evening, i walked to the grocery store to buy a pack of cigs when out of the corner of my eye i see a man in a mask with a gun. he tells us all to get down on the ground or he will shoot us and skin our family alive. so, naturally, we all got on the grown and complied with our captor. my heart was racing, i couldnt believe this was actually happening! i went for my phone to call the police but he saw me and kept me in his crosshair for a good 15 minutes while his friend cleared the register. after collecting all the money, they were making their way out when suddenly a cop turns the corner of the door and aims his pistol at one of the robbers. he yells freeze er! and the robbers stopped in their tracks. the cop told the robbers to drop their weapons and they did so. the cop then yelled holy  he is resisting! the criminal then started to say but, i alread... when the cop layed down the criminals life. the other criminal stood their shocked and frightened at his fallen comrad when the cop says now its your turn, bite the counter! which, in my opinion, was an odd request. the criminal listened to the officer of the law and put his teeth around the edge of the counter. the hero & hunk of a police officer then said say goodnight, er! and proceded to stomp the black mans head in. i was so amazed by what i had just witnessed all i could do was start a slow clap, everyone in the store was screaming and yelling in amazement at the officers fine work. it was the rush i needed, it was amazing and i highly reccomend the experience.",49.6

"is it optimized? yes does it run at 60fps? yes does mouse and keyboard work well with it? yes does it look good? yes does it look better then console version? yes i played it on xbox one earlier today and i notice the difference in some areas moreso then others does it look 10x better then console does it look better overall indeed it does. did rockstar have enough servers to make gta 5 playable online at launch? no (kinda didnt surprise me anyways) was it worth the wait for the pc version if you already owned a xbox one or ps4 version? thats up for debate im undecided i dont write reviews often games cause i suck at writing them anyways, if you havent owned gta 5 its a must have to own especially on pc. if you dont have a very good gaming pc but already own a xbox one and or ps4 but are thinking about trying the pc version you can if you want but it wont be worth it in my opinion. benchmarks will follow specs: i5 4670k 3.4ghx oc to 4.4 ghz 16gb of corsair ddr3 1600mhz gtx 970 g1 gamining edition anyways theres the most important specs i maxxed out the game at 1080p using very high and ultra settings when possible with 8x msaa then theres the option of 4xmsaa with txaa i tried both the second option used a little less gpu ram and looked same as first option in my opinion and ran the benchmark mimumum fps was 26 max was 60 (vsync was on) and it uses 3764mb of the 4096 mb of availible video ram mind you thats everything up even in advanced settings so heres the wrap up 60fps nice its very well optimized mouse and keyboard are great and work good even for driving its a definite graphical improvement sometimes more noticeable then others but dont expect it to be mind blowing difference if you played ps4 or xbox one overall 9/10 (hype made it lose one point same with gta online not working)(which was partially expected) disclaimer i am candian and trevor doesnt represent canadians lol! ps this is my opinion your milage with the game may vary edited:: alot of people are having widespread issues with game not working from what i heard people that have it threw steam are having no issues for the most part people who got it threw rockstar warehouse are having issues for the most part so i hope there issues get fixed and whoever buys it doesnt have those issues just a warning",8.7

"wow, just wow. in just a day i have gotten around 12 hours in game, ive started online and i am up to the planning for the first heist. what ive noticed: positive: - very good optimisation ( a dev that isnt so mean to amd users for once <3 ) - the anti-aliasing is just beautiful - i have noticed that things at a distance get blurred/fogged; this makes it look so rich, so instead of seeing rough textures, it gets softened off ( in a differant way to anti-aliasing, i think. ) bad: - after pre-loading i had to do a 220mb download, however it took 45 minutes to actually install and decrypt the file - during my livestream, i had a glitch where in climbed over a ledge during an early mission, only to find myself catapulted 400m into the air, then fail the mission from dying - the steering sensitivity on a keyboard doesnt seem to have the ability to be adjusted - during the day when i wanted to play online, the servers didnt seem to be up and the game kept displaying the message - cannot connect to the social club servers - was flying a heli that took me around an hour to find, then during my livestream my brother comes up and presses f on my keyboard :( thank you for reading, so far i am very impressed. i am very confident i will get my moneys worth out of this game. i may do an update on this review tomorrow after i have played another 12 hours ;) btw, i have been playing on a pretty stable 50fps on max settings 1080p :d specs: amd fx 8350 4ghz 8 core cpu ( water cooled) ) gigabyte 970a-d3p radeon r9 270x direct cu ll top ( 2gb gddr5 ) 1tb sata3 hardrive (6 gbs per second) 8gb kingston ddr3 1600mhz (2x4gb) 7.1 audio ( built into mobo ) windows 7 home premium 64bit",59.1

"amazing pc port !! runs butter smooth @ 1920x1080 on my gtx 970 with almost all the bells and whistles turned on (and it does offer a huge variety of video options). the graphical fidelity is outstanding -esp. for an open world game. i am very happy they didnt dumb it down unlike so many other contemporary pc ports. beware of the ~ 60 gb download / hard disc space requirement though. the game also seems to be using up almost all of my 4096 mb video memory. so if you have a mid range pc, i suggest disabling anti aliasing and turning the texture quality sliders down a notch to ensure smooth gameplay. im not even gonna waste time reviewing the actual gameplay/storyline as this game has been out on consoles for almost 2 years now. but for us pc players it was certainly worth the wait. brb overclocking my gpu so i can crank up the msaa even more ... #justmasterracethings",9.8

"ive already completed the story and reached level 67 (online) on xbox360. what i can tell you now is that the pc is a definate improvement. ill be updating this review as i see fit but for now here are some reasons you should/shouldnt buy the game: pros: - excellent optimisation. dont listen to the other guys with low fps and crashing. - looks amazing. like, best graphics ive seen. for real. - cool story - fun gameplay - endless playability - gta online is the center of some of my best gaming memories. - custom radio stations omg - you can plug xbox wired controllers (or wireless if you have an adapter) in on the fly. no restarts, no settings, it just happens. perfect for getting in a car, pushing the usb in and not getting a scratch because you can actually drive the bloody thing. - first person is pretty cool cons: - this game is huge. 59.1gb to download. if you cant handle it, dont do it. - some of the online players are s to say the least - dlc is pretty hefty - terrible driving without a controller (but what did you expect) - first person, while it is cool, gets old. dont spend money on the pc version just for the first person feature. especially if you own it on ps3 or xbox360 already. you will be dissapointed. - ill admit, the launch wasnt fantastic.",25.1

"everything about my passion for the series gta v im on the road somewhere in the desert, asphalt - pink at sunset on my glasses aviators, in his hand - a pistol with a silencer. life - a complicated thing. in the distance seemed machine, and i know that this movie was going to happen, because the decision has already been taken. then there will remain only a crime scene may lead a quiet country of radio fired at the car. for fifteen minutes of real time in gta v has time to occur so interesting that for the whole game cutscene cheaply enough. got into a fight with the homeless, drenched them with gasoline and set on fire, tried hijack jeep, the dead driver knocked down, the leg stuck in the radiator, the cops, kill, got into the jeep drove off, the gas tank is breached, burn, jump on the asphalt, car explode at a distance. thats all - in two minutes. now die in traffic accidents - simple (much easier than in gta iv summary of the game), and the city all the time you travel with this thought. crashed on the fly on an opposite - a way to continue in the air, without a car. but this car is almost always possible to turn left stick - is unrealistic, yes, but not break the rhythm of the game. she eventually became harmonious, not without flaws, but for such a colossus like gta, - a major achievement. feeling of continuous action - one of the main objectives in the case of rockstar gta v. narrative job followed without interruption, clinging to one another, which is why the player with the first seconds of narration captured and may go through the game a couple of times looking menu with incredible beauty ambient tangerine dream. game included, and it is itself forward as a film about gangsters, but without the participation of our film is not spinning. *** you can speak at length about how gta v hits record, earns a billion dollars in the first three days and finally pushes the game in general cultural background. houser brothers (and after some time we turn on the card) if this transition is felt even before the game, and maybe here and legs grow their sermons. interestingly another: this is an adult a game based on the boyish emotions, and therein lies its charm. this is partly why gta can not escape the violence. and this is a very cruel game (not the first, and obviously not the last in rockstar), childishly cruel game, psychopathic violent. and naturalness of all it looks like a psychopathic character with complaints of severe childhood - nailed to the floor with wooden toys and other fatal trouble. he did not have those memories of the machine, well, you know, when it is such a great-looking, and it sits a plastic driver: maybe batman can, spider-man, or maybe just the driver. when it was possible to take her hand and go out for an adventure: the carpet turned into an imaginary sun city, like the one from the mysterious film bellied tv. in this fantasy we play, and that fantasy alien - it is for the better. at the end of history show us allegorically statistics in a form of a psychiatrist. the conclusion from the reference, in general, the same - childhood was difficult.",28.5

"the fact that you dont have to listen to roman asking you to go bowling every few minutes should already be a good sign. provided that you have a decent enough computer, you should be able to run it quite nicely. when the graphics are turned all the way up the game can really look amazing. the controls can be a little wonky, but youre free to re-bind them to whatever key you want. (caps lock was the characters special ability button which was super annoying to reach) but in terms of how it runs on pc, i havent seen many glitches which is a really nice comparison to their 2008 release of gta iv.",17.4

"well, what can i say about gta v. the graphics- every one moans on about graphics, and i would like to put this as plainly as possible. on what was a medium rig when i bought it in january 2014, i can run the game at medium texture detail- this does look better than gta v on the pisspoor, and the xbone presumably has no better. the aesthetics are good, but watch dogs was better even before the patches that got the e3 bloom working. some games go for more realistic, but if you have seen a car in gta v, you will know they went for shiny. not alienating, just could have been better. the singleplayer- this is the same as the consoles, so nothing new to those who have played or seen it. i find it boring, i dont like the character development, i find the writing as polished as my last turd. some people like it, simple minded or easily amused people, or those who dont take games too seriously. this is too subjective to settle in a paragraph. the multiplayer- unfortunately, rockstar took the activision aproach of everyone loves multiplayer! put all of the money into it and while it is amazing, it is bittersweet. the singleplayer suffered from lacking what i liked about gta san andreas, which is hard to put into words, but the multiplayer can be endless fun if you have the right amount of friends. unfortunately, my group of friends is 5 strong and everything is based around multiples of 2, unless you are going for records on races. to settle this, as i implied earlier i take games quite seriously. so i killed one of them* over it. the missions are well thought out, but i can see myself playing nerdcubeds missions for 90% of the time when the custom missions are fixed. controls- my friend told me that the way that driving was programmed, it would be near impossible without a controller, from what he had read prior to release, but i use a keyboard and mouse for everything. aiming is not overpowered, as with a controller, aim assist means one only has to tap the left trigger to have a headshot lined up from the otherside of one of the deathmatch arenas. because of this, you dont get queued with controller users if you are on a keyboard and mouse, luckily. flying a helicopter is designed to be awkward. expecting it to be similar to just cause 2, the grand master of open world third person shooters until jc3 is released, i was horrifically shocked. but i still found using the numpad and wasd to be better than controller, and mouse is only good if precision isnt required. overall- i love this game, but there are so many things i would change if i made it, but that is the basic economic problem. it isnt possible to satisfy all human wants. so i leave this game with a reluctantly high, 9/11.* *distasteful joke",37.9

"ive played a ton of the ps3 and ps4 versions before pc, so consider this a sort-of comparison thing if youre thinking about switching. if youre new to gta v then you might want to look at other reviews because this might not help you so much, i havent touched the singleplayer game beyond the mandatory prologue before getting straight into online. the key reasons i wanted gta v pc even though ive already played it a lot were: graphics, controls and so i could play with pc-playing friends. the configurability of the graphics is pretty crazy, there are a lot of options here - its not like the average port where youre lucky if you can change the resolution. the game properly supports multi (ive tested triple 1080p) monitor setups, as in theyve actually put some thought into how itll look so you dont get any crazy gui mess like you do in other games, it even fades the peripheral monitors in and out if it needs to. ive got a fairly ok rig, an i5 2500k and a gtx 680, and it runs great at 1080p but obviously its nowhere near the max settings but it still looks a lot better than the console versions. there is the odd hiccup in the frame rate but on the whole it is a night and day difference coming from even the ps4 version. i havent seen any particularly alarming bugs or artifacts, either, maybe the odd lod transition that takes longer than it should (even though its running from an ssd) but nothing you wouldnt expect, really. the default keyboard controls are awful, they use pretty much the entire keyboard - even the numpad! the default flying controls are wasd for throttle and rudder, num 2468 for pitch and roll and the mouse does the camera... i dont have three hands. admittedly its not all that common to need the camera but im going to eventually try to come up with a better configuration for all that. it would be nice if you could turn off camera auto-center for vehicles but i dont think you can. there are other weird things, too, like cycling prev/next weapon in vehicles; mouse wheel up or tab to go to the next weapon, or [ to go to the previous. what? so thats left hand or mouse for next weapon, take your hand off the mouse and look for the [ key that no one ever uses in games to avoid having to cycle all the way back around to the weapon before the one you were on. still, you can remap that, so thats ok. lack of analogue control over vehicles is a big deal, offroading is terrible because you just wheelspin all the time, it could really do with a slow modifier (maybe it has one, i didnt spend much time looking at the car control binds). im not sure about directinput controller support, it definitely supports 360 controllers though so you could have one on your lap to switch to for vehicles. however, for all thats bad about the keyboard and mouse controls, it has one massive, massive plus: mouse aim. this is the biggest game changer for me, i can actually hit stuff with my first shot when firing from vehicles now and the marksman rifle is actually useful! i think it would be worth hacking some sort of one-handed driving controller together just to be able to use a mouse to aim while i drive, its so good. i might even use first person mode for more than just messing around now. finally, being able to play with friends. it seems like almost everyone i regularly talk to has now bought gta v and everyone else is on the fence but holding off because its expensive, so for now at least theres no shortage of people to join. the social club crews feature means i can be a member of a variety of different, er, social clubs (i.e. a group of irl friends, a group of one gaming site, a group of another, etc.) and play with anyone from any of them at any time without much trouble, except i did have one problem last night in that the in-game friends list was saying a friend i was talking to was offline... but thats also ok, because the game supports the steam join game feature, and you can also invite people through the rockstar social club overlay. theres also in-game voice chat with push to talk (no more being assaulted by people breathing down their mics or coughing!) but it wasnt working when i tried it three hours after the launch, and global/team text chat in addition to text messages - communicating is therefore much easier, which is extremely handy in a game where communication during jobs is so important. yes, online still has the long load times and flaky servers the console versions have, but you can massively reduce the wait by installing the game on an ssd so theres that at least. otherwise, the game is pretty much the same; same cars, same guns, same map, etc. snapmatic does have a meme text feature now and there is of course the replay editor, but i havent touched that yet and i dont know if i will, apparently the buffer isnt very long. oh, and theres the custom radio station which i havent set up yet. thatll be handy, i was getting a bit sick of cant hardly stand it.",63.5

"great game as we all know it by now playing on consoles before (i only played it on 360 just for the sake of finishing it and then waited for pc release.) the game came with some issues for some people such as the username having special characters. however mine is my microsoft account with my email in there, it didnt seem to caused any issues in launching the game. i did have some issue launching it at start as i would click on the play button and it would show for couple second on steam that im in-game but then itd go away for no reason. the fix for that i found that you need to manually install the installers from installers and _commonredist folder if you had an issue like mine where it didnt auto installed it. i am having another issue now the game crashing, it only crashed twice so far in my almost 2hr of game play but still is annoying. i am hoping for it to be working fine with couple updates. so once youre past that and can launch the game successfully. its a gorgeous looking one to say the least in my opinion, pc port is better than max payne 3 for me. im playing it on 4k with 50-60 fps constantly in closed locaitons or while fighting and 45-50 while driving at everything max on 970 sli setup. its doing rather well and youll get steady fps with something like this setup. all in all .. the game is totally worth its price, i didnt like these launch issues that i had which were minor but the game crashing and saying gta v has stopped working is making me mad to say the least and others are still facing some other issues. maybe .. wait a while until they fix it, at least theyre not ubisoft and i have high hopes from rockstar to fix their mistakes. launch issues aside, game is very well optimized and well worth the price.",29.7

"i can currently not recommend buying it - there are heaps of problems, at the moment gta v seems like a game that has been released way to soon. amongst others: 1. launcher issue - you will need to create a windows local admin account if you are having a useraccount name with certain characters. (this is the case for almost everyone who has windows 8/10 as you usually have the @ due to the microsoft account). 2. more launcher issues - beside this there are various problems for people with different avs, dual graphic card settings, etc. 3. performance - it is a hit and miss. once you finally can get into it..it works... next time it is so slow it does crash windows as it has an massive issue with memory spill. it is playable, yes. some people do get lucky and have a machine where it does work..and the game itself is as good as you have seen it on the consoles a year ago. but...some if not most players experience problems.... and this is unacceptable. update: wow, it is even getting worse. on one of my three machines the game could be loaded -although with massive performance problems that occured randomly-. well. the last patch was installed yesterday, after that it worked as well. now it does not start on either of the three machines. congratulations rockstar - after almost 18 years that ive played your games for countless hours it is the first time i am seriously disappointed. it seems this is yet another game pushed out early due to pressure from shareholders and marketing. i will wait for another 3 days before i will apply for a refund from steam.",10.5

"played this game for two years on ps3 and have salivated over the thought of how good this game could be if done correctly. my god. its flawless. this is how you do a port. i never imagined this game running this good. i knew it would be better than gta iv on pc, but i never expected this. i adore this game. in my opinion all it needed on pc was 60fps and 1080p native. we got so much more. absolutely the best it could have possibly been. never drops below 60fps with every single thing i could find maxed out(except msaa, id need another 980 for that lol). were talking a game and dev that released a notoriously poorly optimized port and mindnumblingly cpu intensive game, and now were maxing even all draw distances, objects, shadows, pedestrians, and traffic. even with all that it still maxes out my ing gtx 980! there is no cpu bottleneck to be found here. throw all of your doubt about this game out the window, it is ing perfection. if youre interested in the slightest, and have at least the recommended specs, buy this game right now. just for reference: gigabyte z77x-d3h i7-3770k @4.4ghz 16 gb corsair vengeance ram @1866mhz msi gtx 980 gaming 4gb 250gb samsung evo ssd asus 144hz vg248qe any questions about this game or its performance feel free to ask.",55.3
"run great on my evga gtx x titan with 1920x1080p. it is faboulous game and has a really nice hud interface. just like any modern game would have. graphics are great and the best part is customizing the cars. this game is truely a great game and nothing needs to be added. no bugs or anything yet and still pretty nice for a 2013 game.",16.6
"i have bought this game 3 times already. (the fact that i bought it 3 times must mean something) i currently own grand theft auto v for the xbox 360, xbox one, and pc. this game is one of the best games i have ever played. it runs amazing my rig. i highly recommend this game. pros:",16.9
"my pc met all requirements the only question mark was gpu which is integrated, it will still run and smoothe though rockstar really did a good job with this. i can tell they made full use of the delay times they had, with my integrated graphics card i shouldnt be able to run it but i can. however that will be upgraded today. was well worth the wait rockstar great job on making the pc version. ps. which is not a port it was developed with the main game side by side",83.2
"this game is perfect. it plays like a dream, and its most definitely the definitive version of the game. 10/10 on r* redeeming themselves, this port is perfect.",31.2
"grand theft auto are one of my favourite game series. gta v is the best gta game after san andreas, which i loved due to it being my childhood game and being the game to bring new things that year and with a huge map and possibilities. i have played this game both on xbox360 and pc. its amazing. the storyline is amazing, the graphics are great, the pc port is awesome (works smoother than on x360), comparing to gta ivs port (which was  on pc, very bad performance issues). the online is great, as long as you dont play to grind it, and have some friends to play it. anyways, the pc version > console is that theres some new features, and the files were already opened and modding should be available soon, thus we will see some good mods with no doubt. truly a game of the year, for 2015 too.",38.9

"best game i ever played atm.",110.0
"this game is great, but without mods it is kind of the same boring game, if you have previously played it on the consoles but with amazing graphics, compared to the consoles. the best thing about gta on pc is the mods that will be sure to come out, but as there are none yet the game is still kind of dry. this game is not very well optimised for pc players, as the keyboard and mouse controls are kind of unusual, this isnt saying they are unusable, but if a player has never played pc or gta on pc before then it takes some getting used to, which is why i recommend playing this game with a controller, unless you are exclusively playing in first person mode.",34.2

"unbelievable. the coders from r* have been porting the game for almost 2 years, but they didnt think about the owners of the modern laptops with 2 gpus. im not even able to launch the game. upd: ive managed to run the game by disabling my second gpu (and then enabling it), but i hope the devs will fix this as soon as possible. the game is gorgeous, no doubt about that. upd 2: i should make a huge remark. the game optimization is just outstanding. r* did a great job here. everythings running smoothly on my 3-year-old multimedia laptop with high details in 1080p. just amazing.",51.9

"this game eats system ram for breakfast, i recommend 16gb for this game.(had an issue with stuttering and it turned out to be my 8gb ddr4-others with same specs as i with 16gb have no issues, the game uses around 8-10gb at very high settings) but thats not a big deal really because most games dont use resources as well as this game does. it has got to be the most amazing pc port....... neh, pc game ever optimized. yeah you heard me, pc game. the scaling and smoothness was worth the delay, and def huge leaps in looks from its console counterparts. i can not even beleive im saying this, but rockstar nailed it. regardless, the story is fun and endulging and exciting, theres loads, and i do mean loads of graphics settings to cator to your systems needs. the graphics scaling and resource handling is out of this world!!....this is literally the most my pcs hardware has ever been used!; and efficiently and responsibly as well. the games detail is just out of this world! walking around the city, every nook and crany is filled with random detail and the roads are just spectacular; makes the city seem so real how used the roads are, and thats just a small part. i am just incredibly mindblown how rockstar was able to pull this off....now i will be begging for red dead even more!!! just to give some facts for a few people maybe wondering, theres no mouse acceleration, the controls are seemless, controller support (if wierdly you want that) is seemlessly there. fov is decently implemented (not perfect in fps, but im sure mods will change that), it supports ultra widescreen (most cutscenes were made at 16:9 though). the first person functions perfectly. all controls are customizable. and based on low graphics settings, most peoples systems will probably run it well, and low settings still look pretty decent. oh and no frame rate cap! yay! proper ads!

"ive been a fan of grand theft auto for many years, solely playing on the playstation platforms since vice city stories. rockstar has fallen short on pc ports everytime, especially with gta iv. however, this time around is a different story. rockstar developed this game partially in parallel with the console versions rather than sloppily porting the game from the console version over to pc. they did a phenomonal job. performance: i have a gtx 970, i5 4690k, and 16gbs of ram. i am able to max basically all graphical options while achieving a solid 60fps. this excludes high res shadows, extended distance detailing, and whatever else is included in the advanced graphics page. these options eat up performance for little value in return. if you have a lower end system that meets minimum specs, you will have no trouble running this game as long as you do not mind turning some settings down. things to note: - the pc version seamlessly integrates gamepad play, so you can use your keyboad for shooting and your controller for driving and find no issues switching over while you play. - you can add your own music to a custom radio station which is traditional for pc versions of gta. im glad they carried this over! however, many people are running into performance issues such as texture pop-ins and major framerate decreases when listening to the custom station deemed self radio. i have not ran into any of these issues. all in all, this is, with no contest, the definitive version of grand theft auto v.",70.6

"for all of you complaining about the game not working on launch day realize this - its a launch day. that being said, on launch day, a few hours after it had unlocked, i got into single player without a problem, and social club was not bothersome. this is hands down the best pc product rockstar has done, even better than max payne 3 (an amazing port by the way) this is not a port, but instead what feels like something that was engineered from the bottom up to be on the leading platform, and its minumin specs even let you play it on a video card thats from the mid 2000s. after playing this on a 360, its just like how i wanted to remember it, now with a great keyboard and mouse control scheme. most rockstar ports measure your performance via the amount of vram thats been allocated for your card. to produce a great image on screen, 2gb would be good. for fully maxed out, its best to go for a 4gb card. however, i myself use more than the game says i should, and it runs fine, with the highest texuture settings. a few technical highlights.... -you get raw mouse input for zero mouse acceleration -borderless window, works well. -tons of options for shaders, post processing, aa, anti aliasing... even grass. -this game supports both amd and nvidia exclusive tech. woot! is it worth $60? unless you commit your life to the new rockstar editor, the fact stil remains that this is a two year old game, which is now, granted, on the platform of choice. however, i strongly suggest you wait until a sale. (as of writing this, were looking at about a couple of months away from a steam summer sale, wait then.) it is clear that any delay for this game is completly justified, since the end result is a well oiled product, something that is becoming rare nowadays. finally, we have a proper grand theft auto game, and it just so happens to be the best one in the series.",15.8
"first impression: see my profile for pc specs. (please note i have played the game on ps3, ps4, and now this (comparison at the bottom) (i also had an issue with launching the game, see below) i will start by saying (see below for game review) i didnt expect to run this game so well, on a laptop with a nvidia gt 650m 2gb. its a 3 year old card so i didnt feel like i would push the settings up to high. so lets start with graphical. rockstar really have done well with the minimum requirements, with my laptop an alienware m14x r2, i was able to have all settings on either high, or normal and the game still looks better than the console version. while they are locked to 30fps i was getting a low of 48 and a high of 64 fps including in the city, in the air, and during rush hour on the highways. note: couldnt run msaa as i ran out of video memory (2gb) but af was at 16x without loss. ok onto the game itself. first off the first impressions when i ran the game. well. it took me a solid hour to figure out why it wouldnt even load. i had to disable my nvidia card (i use optimus) then reenable it at the menu screen to get the game to run. once it had i quickly played through the prologue to get a feel for the controls. i will say i had to look into the button bindings when i couldnt do something i needed to. so memorize those buttons! the story is what youd expect from rockstar, full of drugs, sex and violence, i wouldnt mind playing through again in the beautiful detail. you can play up to 3 characters as they go on a journey to ravish los santos of its moneys, dealing with corruption, sexually active tv presenters and lindsay lohan clones. gta 5 was the first gta game i ever finished and i loved it. there is also plenty to do afterwards. ok onto online. it let me transfer my ps4 character which i transfered from my ps3 with no hassle including the bonus preorder cash. i didnt suffer any lag but maybe that was because i was alone in the server.. not sure if that is my settings or a server issue. overall, owning the ps3, pc and ps4 version, the story, online and the graphics let alone steam integration is enough to force me off the consoles and onto the pc version. comparrison. if you have a ps3/xbox360 and own a ps4/xbone or pc. please make the jump to next gen or pc, the graphics alone are worth it, but make it a pc version if you want fluid motion with over 40fps+ on a decent system with settings near the max.",21.3

"too soon to post a review? no, not at all, because this games been a year and a half coming and if you honestly havent played it yet, despite your platform bias, then you really missed out on a great gaming experience. however, for those of you who were craving the experience of a next-generation grand theft auto from the comfort of your own pc, then have i got news for you: grand theft auto v has finally arrived on steam, fully optimized for the true pc gaming experience. the game looks better than the xbox one and the playstation 4, if you can believe it (which you probably can). pc grand theft auto v comes with all of the content released up to this point on the consoles with a few neat additional features. the rockstar editor allows you to create your own movies. the game comes with a fps camera view thats surprisingly fully functional (disorienting, though). the game has full controller support, but works just as fine with the keyboard and mouse. i personally run the xbox one controller for driving and flight, keyboard and mouse for everything else. launch-day stability, at least for me, has been pretty good -- i only crashed once in the past six hours ive been playing. ive heard that some folks have been running into issues getting the game pre-loaded, but i had no such issues so i cant really speak on their behalf. i have no problem recommending this game. its been a long time coming and i know a lot of folks are bitter towards rockstar for taking their sweet time, but the end-product is worth it. i ran the game on the following rig: i5-4690k @ 3.5 (no overclocking done) asus strix geforce gtx 970 8 gb ddr3 1600 hz msi z97 gaming 5 motherboard with msaa turned off (everything else at maximum) and v-sync turned on im able to achieve fluctuating frames between 55 and 60 frames per second.",25.6

"how could i possibly give this top one sandbox game a bad comment? definitely awesome! rockstar games postponed this game like three or four times, it might make some people critisize the game itself because of that. i think it totally worth waiting. good graphic optimization and integrated contents, even including the groundbreaking first person camera view, are not something you could see every day on pc games. totally worth trying, dont let the price scare you!",17.5

"works like a charm even on an older system (i7-2600k, gtx 570, 8gigs of ram). though you need really strong hardware to enjoy more-than-a-console type of graphics. anyway, rockstar came through with their promise of optimisation. great game, great pc version. 10/11, would would again. edit: quick tip - if youre using the latest nvidia drivers and nvidia geforce experience just find the game in your experience app and click optimize. it did wonders to me. everything looks so nice and it doesnt drop fps much if at all.",11.7

"gta 5. youve either played it by now, or you have seen someone play it. if you havent yet, you either have done a great job managing to avoid one of the most popular games for the last few years or you are resilient and have been waiting for the ultimate version to come out on the superior machine. well, its finally here. the ultimate edition of gta 5. 60 fps, 1080p, and upgraded graphics. this game truly looks incredible. one fear many people had about this version of gta was whether or not the port was going to be of max payne 3 quality or gta 4 quality. thankfully it appears to have landed on the max payne 3 side of rockstar quality. there is a lot of hate for gta, because of the open ended nature of the game. many do not enjoy the story, or would rather just cause havok in los santos. causing havok is plenty of fun, but can get stale after a while which is why i love the story so much. the story is overflowing with personality, odd characters, likable characters and downright scumbags. there is plenty of variety to keep the story moving and it stays fresh right to the very end. i havent touched the online yet, but from what ive read it is overall enjoyable and should keep the life of gta going for a few years. i just need to find out whether rockstar will allow modding for gta 5 or not. that will truely determine if gta 5 is going to have a long lifespan or eventually fade out from peoples libraries.",36.1
"spent two hours waiting for this be unpacked, while sitting on the hype train, after spending two years waiting for it to be realized. launched the game had to make a social club, the servers were dying because rockstar could not comphrend the superior power of the master race, finally got to get into the actual game, pfft game auto set to 800x600 for the console peasants alright, spend twenty minutes changing graphics to the optimal master race specs. game looks great runs smooth. played through the intro nice, decided to try to play online, again rockstar didnt count the number of slaves from gta iv online was down. so, whatever game looks nice might as well play the campaign. two hours later, try to play online again it actually worked, but glitchy as the console. 100-200 cars but only in the color black. shoot a car until it explodes. car hell. steal a viper from some kid, sell it go to bed. spent the entire launch night wandering around waiting and making mass suicide runs while in skype call with five other master race  riding the hype train all night.",42.9

"wow... what a game. i pre-loaded this sometime over the weekend waiting for 4/14 but was released a bit earlier on the 13th. ive had this game on all the generations, 360, one, and now pc. let me tell you something... i honestly looked at the trailers and pictures for the pc and thought well, this doesnt look that much differnet for such a delay. until i pressed play... (i did have the windows account error - which was an easy fix for me.) the game is just purely stunning and the crisp sounds of engine and rifles. the story line... now that is an amazment that would keep you entertained for days and days! the gta online dlcs; some may be bad but then you have massive ones such as gta online heists which is just spectacular. this game could bring hundreds of hours of fun once you really get into it!",11.7

(you can use your online character in single player). play as any character like the republican space ranger and you can enable cheats, making you feel like a superhero. youll be able to make some really creative movies with all the options theyve given you, an improvement over gta 4. theyve also added a custom radio station as well. this is truly the ultimate version of gta 5 and i highly recommend it.",60.5

"this is exactly what ive been waiting for, for the past 2 years ever since gta v was released for console back in 2013. this game is well optimized, feels responsive and runs like butter. im currently playing on a 3 year old gaming desktop with a gtx570, 6gbs of ram and an intel i7 quad-core 960 on a 144hz monitor with v-sync turned on and its locked and runs constantly on that framerate (with the exception that it dips down a little bit when theres a bit to much happening on the screen at once) currently running the game on normal-high and it feels great. the 60fps+ is exactly what i needed after playing this game on xbox360/ps3/ps4 for so long in 30fps and sometimes dipping below because its console yknow :^) gta v is the ultimate open world game and it feels like the best one yet from rockstar. gta iv had its moments but you reached the limits to the game once you beat the game on a 100%. the fifth installment has it all and it even has gta online that expands upon the newly added heists mode that you can do with friends and other cool stuff to do such as jobs, various competetive gamemodes and the rockstar editor that gives you the ability to craft your own gamemodes and etc. but the best thing about the game for me personally, is the singleplayer. the singleplayer adds a new twist to the storymode giving you the ability to play as 3 characters instead of one, all with their different and unique playstyles. the voice acting, animations and enviroment makes it all pretty immersive and realistic. the satyrical reimaging of modern day california is both hilarious and true at the same time. the best feature rockstar has added, has to be the 1st person mode that builds upon traditional fps controls and at the same time has the same button layout as normal gta controls. for me, gta v is probably one of the best games i have ever played. this is the 3rd time i bought it, but it was worth it. im really happy with what rockstar did and i really appreciate the time and effort they put into making and giving us the best gta experience possible. so please, buy this game, buy it! :d",37.4

"for all of you complaining about the game not working on launch day realize this - its a launch day. that being said, on launch day, a few hours after it had unlocked, i got into single player without a problem, and social club was not bothersome. this is hands down the best pc product rockstar has done, even better than max payne 3 (an amazing port by the way) this is not a port, but instead what feels like something that was engineered from the bottom up to be on the leading platform, and its minumin specs even let you play it on a video card thats from the mid 2000s. after playing this on a 360, its just like how i wanted to remember it, now with a great keyboard and mouse control scheme. most rockstar ports measure your performance via the amount of vram thats been allocated for your card. to produce a great image on screen, 2gb would be good. for fully maxed out, its best to go for a 4gb card. however, i myself use more than the game says i should, and it runs fine, with the highest texuture settings. a few technical highlights.... -you get raw mouse input for zero mouse acceleration -borderless window, works well. -tons of options for shaders, post processing, aa, anti aliasing... even grass. -this game supports both amd and nvidia exclusive tech. woot! is it worth $60? unless you commit your life to the new rockstar editor, the fact stil remains that this is a two year old game, which is now, granted, on the platform of choice. however, i strongly suggest you wait until a sale. (as of writing this, were looking at about a couple of months away from a steam summer sale, wait then.) it is clear that any delay for this game is completly justified, since the end result is a well oiled product, something that is becoming rare nowadays. finally, we have a proper grand theft auto game, and it just so happens to be the best one in the series.",15.8

"first impression: see my profile for pc specs. (please note i have played the game on ps3, ps4, and now this (comparison at the bottom) (i also had an issue with launching the game, see below) i will start by saying (see below for game review) i didnt expect to run this game so well, on a laptop with a nvidia gt 650m 2gb. its a 3 year old card so i didnt feel like i would push the settings up to high. so lets start with graphical. rockstar really have done well with the minimum requirements, with my laptop an alienware m14x r2, i was able to have all settings on either high, or normal and the game still looks better than the console version. while they are locked to 30fps i was getting a low of 48 and a high of 64 fps including in the city, in the air, and during rush hour on the highways. note: couldnt run msaa as i ran out of video memory (2gb) but af was at 16x without loss. ok onto the game itself. first off the first impressions when i ran the game. well. it took me a solid hour to figure out why it wouldnt even load. i had to disable my nvidia card (i use optimus) then reenable it at the menu screen to get the game to run. once it had i quickly played through the prologue to get a feel for the controls. i will say i had to look into the button bindings when i couldnt do something i needed to. so memorize those buttons! the story is what youd expect from rockstar, full of drugs, sex and violence, i wouldnt mind playing through again in the beautiful detail. you can play up to 3 characters as they go on a journey to ravish los santos of its moneys, dealing with corruption, sexually active tv presenters and lindsay lohan clones. gta 5 was the first gta game i ever finished and i loved it. there is also plenty to do afterwards. ok onto online. it let me transfer my ps4 character which i transfered from my ps3 with no hassle including the bonus preorder cash. i didnt suffer any lag but maybe that was because i was alone in the server.. not sure if that is my settings or a server issue. overall, owning the ps3, pc and ps4 version, the story, online and the graphics let alone steam integration is enough to force me off the consoles and onto the pc version. comparrison. if you have a ps3/xbox360 and own a ps4/xbone or pc. please make the jump to next gen or pc, the graphics alone are worth it, but make it a pc version if you want fluid motion with over 40fps+ on a decent system with settings near the max.",21.3
"too soon to post a review? no, not at all, because this games been a year and a half coming and if you honestly havent played it yet, despite your platform bias, then you really missed out on a great gaming experience. however, for those of you who were craving the experience of a next-generation grand theft auto from the comfort of your own pc, then have i got news for you: grand theft auto v has finally arrived on steam, fully optimized for the true pc gaming experience. the game looks better than the xbox one and the playstation 4, if you can believe it (which you probably can). pc grand theft auto v comes with all of the content released up to this point on the consoles with a few neat additional features. the rockstar editor allows you to create your own movies. the game comes with a fps camera view thats surprisingly fully functional (disorienting, though). the game has full controller support, but works just as fine with the keyboard and mouse. i personally run the xbox one controller for driving and flight, keyboard and mouse for everything else. launch-day stability, at least for me, has been pretty good -- i only crashed once in the past six hours ive been playing. ive heard that some folks have been running into issues getting the game pre-loaded, but i had no such issues so i cant really speak on their behalf. i have no problem recommending this game. its been a long time coming and i know a lot of folks are bitter towards rockstar for taking their sweet time, but the end-product is worth it. i ran the game on the following rig: i5-4690k @ 3.5 (no overclocking done) asus strix geforce gtx 970 8 gb ddr3 1600 hz msi z97 gaming 5 motherboard with msaa turned off (everything else at maximum) and v-sync turned on im able to achieve fluctuating frames between 55 and 60 frames per second.",25.6

"yes. i played this on the xbox 360 on the day it came out. there was no online, so i played the single player, then i realised that the rendering of the game was just awful! then online came out, i tryed it, it didint work at all, when it did it was fun. i would give it a 8/10, but on pc it fixes everything. the online perfect, the singleplayer perfect, the rendering perfect. so in short note 0/10 ign - too much water",34.4
"aside from the issues with installing the game, i give gta 5, easily, 5/5 ign, 10/10 gamespot, 6/6 demongaming. holy crap i think this is one of the best gtas so far. the optimization is better than i expected with the graphics, and since i waited since the pc version was announced, its even more legit to me now. see everyone online hopefully :)",24.7
"one of the best games ive played, graphics and sound are brilliant. thought id be disappointed due to hype but its a fantastic game, well recommended.",14.9
"you dont need mine or anyone elses opinion on why this is the best game that ever was, instead ill use this space to give you guys some troubleshooting info: game wont start (win 7) - make sure you have service pack 1 installed (win 7) this fixes most social club issues. - make sure you have the latest drivers. - .net framework 4.5 is required - disable antivirus and firewall for installation low fps with good hardware - turn of high res shadows - take postfx down a notch - use fxaa only for very high end systems (980, 780ti, 970, 290x etc) - watch the memory meter for vram, when setting up game, and add about 20-25% to get a real number of vram usage. - push settings up, one thing ive noticed is game runs much better when pushing the hardware. happy gaming",39.7
"nice touch for fun gaming, gta v online, heist, etc like every single roleplay",57.2
"realy nice game. the graphics are just beautifull. i think to play on high-end you need atleast 8gb ram, else you could play on 720p. the story mode is as fun as the online mode. there is just a lil problem, when the nat of your network is set to strict you may not be able to play online, but you can fix that in the router settings i guess. however i highly recommend this game cuz its so fun. so we will soon meet online then huh? ;3 -biscuit",46.3
"10/10 finally came to pc!! if you have $60 to buy this game do it! its so worth",59.4
"its here on pc now, is it worth it? yes! rockstar did a great job with the graphics and the game looks great with lots of attention paid to details and evnironments. they also did a great job with bringing life into the characters. the game runs completely maxed 1920x1080 on my system with full antialiasing (i7 4930k @ 4.5ghz and a gtx 980 4gb with 32gb of memory) and i get 50-60 fps constantly. its really fun, a big improvement from gta iv. driving is a little tough at first, but once you get the hang of it, its much better than in gta iv.",38.1
"ah, the legend returns to the mastah race! but more seriously, this game has finally arrived on pc with its fenomenal graphics (some dull textures here and there though) and stunning visuals with 4k support in all its glory! what i love: just about everything what could be better: mouse movement feels like it has a delay the gpu usage could have been better as i see some fps drop even if the gpu usage is at 70-80 ish. there is also a frequent happening of cars popping up from the ground, wheels on idle cars stuck half way in the ground.",57.6
"its finally here, and its great.",38.7
"here comes again after years of releasing, pc version surely immersive, those funs never end.",3.7

"an actual proper pc port from rockstar?? shocking!",13.6
"great game. theres good graphics even on normal and lots to do. make sure you update graphics drivers though. i had random force closes before i did.",31.3
"becomes a roadkill by insane civilians with panic issues... 10/10 would flip & fly in 1st person again. on serious note i would recommend this game to any gta fan, even on my  as pc i can play it on around 30 fps (isnt much but i can play it!), there are some issues with session disconnect etc but i assume its only during the first few days of launch of servers being overloaded and will be fixed soon as we go on, otherwise i havent encountered any issues yet & would defo recommend it as its nicely optimized for pc.",94.4
"oh boy,gta v on the pc the textures,the fps everything so perfect but the best thing about this game is that its actually fun driving around los santos mountains with your friends on an pick up truck driving around the city while your friends shoot out of the windows killing some noobs flying a plane across the map with your crew and jumping out to skydive robbing a bank to get some money to spend on hookers the list goes on and on baby",41.1

"better than fiddling with a pencil for 5 minutes.",87.0
"i have nothing to say about this perfect game. well optimized, great environment atmosphere. this game runs perfectly well on my gtx 880m. i dont really encounter launch issue so i dont know why thats even possible, and whats causing it. p.s.: dont be fooled by the review (by the time of the writing, its mostly positive [79%]). grab it when you have money, you wont regret it by paying the game for full price. if you encounter any issue, you can always ask the support guys whos much better than ea.",39.4
"you can rob convinient stores with your friends, wearing only leapord skin underwear. do i even need to rate this game?",27.9

"how to ruin your life: 1) download gta v 2) learn how to press buttons on your keyboard to play gta v 3) played for hundreds and thousands of hours for that one thing that looks really cool. 4) congratulations, you now have no life. this method is tried-and-true, i have even tested it on myself thats how sure i was that it would work.",72.8
"that was worth of wait. maybe the best and most beautiful openworld game. story is good, but online is so buggy/laggy. you can play this game like 24/7 without getting depressed.",27.3
"its awesome, thanks rockstar!",62.0
"some people are having empty lobby issues or not being able to launch or install, but for me i run perfectly fine, no lag, no empty glitched lobbies, no crashes. (gtx 760 and i7 here) blew my 1 mil online bonus on muggers and mercenaries and strippers. 11/10 would preorder 5 months in advance again",60.3
"iv played both console and pc now and i have to say im loving the pc version. faster game lobby load times. fast overall load times thus far. - (i know some people have had issues with this, however the unfortanate side is not everyone has an up to date system). the level of extended graphical detail options are amazing, especially at 60fps+ i would like to see a fov setting for first person (without looking to mods) no issues with online free mode disconecting every so often like i had happen on console. so far an amazing product. really enjoying it. thanks rockstar!",41.0
"this is truly the best version of the game. no crashes, no bugs, no nothing that is bad (at least for me). and that improved foliage system? its by far one of the greatest ive ever seen in a game. although, i still havent figured out how to aim down the sights/use the scope...",46.6

"this is the best open world game ever created! i just love gta series <3",111.3
"does not work for me, work arounds do not work. will not update or give a good review untill this is fixed. update: after learning i have to disable my graphics card and renable it after launch, i got the game working. there are some bugs with random disconnects in heists that are halting my progress, where people re disconnected from the session randomly. there is alo a glitch that makes your character look at itself and you cannot see what your character is doing untill someone kills themselves to restart teh mission. other than those glitches, the game is good and i enjoy playing it. i have binge played it for a couple days now.",96.6
"this is a great game! it runs almost perfectly for pc and so far i have found no bugs! great game rockstar one of the best i have played recently!",35.4
"wonderful game i dont have the right requirements but it works smooth",29.0
"sold my steam inventory for pc components... totally worth it. sillyness out the way, onto the review. as demanding as the graphics are in terms of performance, it can still hold well on most budget builds around the 180 or so. would seriously recommend anyone to play this incredible game that has a decent build. cons not really a whole lot, its a really solid port. rockstar have put a lot of time into releasing it on pc and id say it was well worth the wait. just, the whole needing to be logged into rockstar social club just to be able to play the single player can be a bit of a pain for the casual player. the minimun requirements are a complete lie. chances are, you will not be able to launch the menu screen without it crashing as well as the in-game video memory calculator. if you have sli graphics cards at both 2gb, it will tell you that you have about 4gb of video memory, do not trust this and start turning everything to ultra graphics expecting it to run at above 60 fps. that is not how sli works, rockstar.. but, so far, ive not experienced any crashes relating to gameplay, just be wary, that 4gb of ram should not be used if you want to have a good experience playing as it tends to stutter in open areas with lots of traffic. 10/10 -ign",31.8
"finally the complete version. online seems to be running good so far. if u want gta 5 get this all the mods and the extra video creator should make for good times",13.5
"first time playing on pc was with pesants for 2 months before it got released first frakin group all had mics and we even teamworked all the way through humane raid from the coke the insurgent the harrier and so forth we became the expendables 5 got into the first harrier and all i heard was highway to the dangerzone and so before any of my teammates got off the platform into their jets all aircraft was gone one of our team members even sounded like jet li and even did a quote exactly like him in the last raid but 10/10 would top gun again!",46.1
"absolutely a good port even though ita not a port. game runs beautifully compared to gta iv, one of the worse ports in history. runs even faster than gta iv, in my opinion. must get 10/10",19.0
"story 10/10 gameplay 10/10 onile 8/10 fix online plz rockstar<3",64.7
"this game has so much content it is amazing! the story is brillient and the online is never ending fun with a massive amount of missions and minigames to do, by yourself , with friends, with your crew or just with some randoms over the internet. little story me and my friend went into the strip club, we had the cops on us, all the strippers ran out and we then chased them for 5 minuets beating the  out of them then being shot in the face by the police. this happened about 3 times..., i only wanted a dance!!",38.9
"i hit a deer then lost the race. 10/10",69.7
"most people got their game running, and a few dont, its maybe on their side not the game, first time i installed it on launch day its smooth and running, maxxed everything out and i am happy with the result! from 90-120 fps on high and 60-80 fps on ultra/very high, over all i am happy with the game, been playing it since it launched on the 360, money well spent! recommended to all of gamers out there (not for kids tho)",80.8
"game is greatly optimized.runs fluently 50-60 fps all the time graphics maxed out. stunning detail the best gta that was ever made. rockstar this time you delivreed what you promised and more. would buy again 10/10",18.5
"nothing more fun than running over hoes with your suv. 10/10",28.9
"it didnt work and i had to disable my graphics card and reenable for it to launch, but i could care less because this is one of the best games ive ever played. best in class at everything. smooth as butter, runs better than gta iv on my computer. single player is worth it alone. gta online is worth it alone.",27.5
"theres a lot of menu options and you can change the controls, but you cant change the gamepad controls if youre using a wired 360 controller as far as i can tell. will update if changed. overall, a kickass game though!! looks beautiful for real.",46.5
"so wait, was the console version just a beta?",16.8
"this game is brilliant, big range to do! i dont think it would be as enjoyable if you werent with friends or a group of guys, but with the internet these days i cant imagine it being hard to find one!",71.6
"havent crashed, the game works perfectly and its purely awesome!",39.5
"this is the clearest, smoothest, sharpest, mind boggling piece of eye candy on steam as of 4/14/2015. i would recommend this game to anyone who has the money and the time to work towards an adder or a sultan rs. the game play is very soft and very attracting. within the first five minutes of me playing this game i zoned out of the outside world when i played gta v online. this game is amazing on the master race of gaming. the pc! if you play the game long enough i promise you will get your moneys worth out of it. it may be expensive but let me tell you that this game is worth every cent.",110.5
"i honestly cant believe people are throwing hissy fits about their games not working. since when is everything perfect? never!!!!!! this game is ing great and its 100% worth buying. its literally endless fun and people can go cry by themselves. yes, theyll need to get their game fixed but why does rockstar need a bad review? they dont because this game is great. people just need to be patient. yeah the game has bugs.... but you try porting a 32 bit console coded game to x64 with way more advancded graphics with oodles of content. i applaud you rockstar for giving us pc gamers this treat to even be able to play this game on pc. now your next slayer task is to port red dead redemption :p",18.0

"i raced 3 other dudes on a bicycle while giving them the middle finger from the front all the way. 11/10 would get raepd at the end again.",9.7
"this is one of the most, if not the most optimized pc port i have ever played. it was worth waiting the many delays. please note that ive already played 50% on the xbone. i got the pc version because it was a bit too hard to control on the xbone. the game runs very well, even though i meet the minimum specs. there are a ton of options that you can control to increase the graphical fidelity. the game even has a monitor to show how much video memory you are using up with the game. i have never seen that before and its really nice if you have an out-of-date gpu. im not going to spoil any of the game for those who havent played this masterpiece. but what i will say is that it is beautifully done. pros: -extensive options menu -excellent story -amazing voice acting -fluid gameplay -gunplay is really fun and rewarding -tons of missions and side missions -plenty of activities like golf and tennis -characters are well-written -graphical fidelity is amazing (if you have a good gpu) -environments are well-detailed -the director mode is an amazing pc-only feature -i cant think of any more. this game is awesome. go buy it if you can spare the money. cons: -you need a really powerful gpu to get the most out of this game -shooting a gun while driving is really difficult. although that can be changed in the options.",36.3

"tl;dr (see bottom paragraphy) the first day of gta v release on the pc was very smooth, it really showed that during the preperation and delays rockstar put an effort in polishing and refining the game and refining the optimization from console to personal computers. rockstar delivered and reaped glory! ^_^ in my opinion gta v is an arcade game where you can roleplay as anything you want, or you can unfold the singleplayer stories of the three different characters. you can play the game in first person view! aside from the story of the singleplayer, you can choose clothing style from different fashions, drive different ground vehicles and boats, fly helicopters and airplanes. parachute from high elevation. aswell as owning pets. ride motorcycles and jet skis. wield different types of firearms and melee weapons. you can exit a vehicle anytime if not blocked or obtructed due to mission restrictions, allowing you to reinact stunt moves as in action movies etc.. you can play sport games, race with npcs, do stunts on airplanes, shoot in gun ranges. you wont have your cousin roman calling you to go bowling again. the downside in gta v is you cant mountaineer, you cant pulverise the ground or any structure in the world, you cant remodel your houses the way you want it to. you cant own pets other than a dog. in gta v los santos you cant travel to vice city or liberty city eventhough you can overhear npcs talking about those two locations. you cant own a non-lethal weapon other than the tazer. no singplayer friends anymore like in gta iv(4) in gta v online the things you can do on gta v online sessions are teaming up with other players around the world and engage in missions ranging from heists to jobs, play different types of game modes like capture the flag, team deathmatch, etc.. or start a heist privately with your crew members or friends and cooperate and work together to complete the objectives. you can mute players who are annoying you and especially when they have an open (hot) microphone. you can setup a crew a group or clan where you can go challenge another crew to war and increase in reputation to receive higher notierity public annoucements whenever one of your crew members join a session or server. receive bonuses by finishing a mission or heist with crew members and overall encouraging players to form crews to complete mission and earn in-game cash. things to know about in gta v online is that you can purchase in-game online credits with real currency, which actually takes out the reward feeling from doing missions or heists because the rewards would mean nothing if you already purchased 8 million in-game online credits anyway. the cons in gta v online is that there is no private voice chat or direct communication, instead everyone hears what you say in the online session world. aswell as xbox players and other console players who play the game have an open (hot) microphone which ruins the mood and everyone can hear their family members yelling and them yelling back at eachother, meanwhile hearing all different noises you just want to avoid hearing while ingame. you can initiate missions without receiving a job or invitation from others on your phone, or walking on glowing areas around the world of los santos gta v. in gta v online it feels very dangerous and chaotic you never can trust anyone in session whom you dont have as friends, if you dont keep a close watch on your map you might have someone trying to backstab you or assassinate you for no particular reason. plus the gta v online community besides outside the game itself makes it hard to make friends outside of missions because its not possible to have private communication with an individual in a server without disturbing everyone unless you call them in the in-game phone. in conclusion the singleplayer mode of the game is very atmospheric and the sea and the trees look great. you can do alot of dangerous things like stunts and other crazy things that you wont risk in real life other than in gta v. the online experience is usually enjoyable, however different players around the world may seem to lag depending on their internet connection to the servers location and the stability of their gear that has enough computing power to run the game graphically and mathematically, which also has the vice-versa effect toward their perspective of where you are in the gta v los santos world. all in all a huge step forward from the consoles both graphically and gameplay a greator if not more enjoyable on the pc in fps mode. very smooth and enjoyable you can lose alot of hours into both the singpleplayer and online especially if you have nothing to do during the holidays. i recommend this game to anyone who has never played it and anyone returning from the old gta titles like vice city.",28.7

"pros: overall a great game for the pc. if you are used to how this game looks on the console, you will be blown away by the graphical improvements and the gta experience at over 30 frames per second. there are a rediculous amount of settings so you can customize the game to your liking. the controller support is also amazing since gta v provides a seemless transition from keyboard to controller. i personally use a controller for flying and keyboard and mouse for everything else. the game as a whole seems so smooth, driving especially. cons: you have to start nitpicking in order to find something about this game that isnt up to par. the obvious for me was the excessive time spent on loading screens. finding a gta online game is a pain since loading screens can sometimes take up a substancial chunk of time. joining jobs and heists also have the loading screens. in the end, i couldnt recommend this game enough. the game itself is among the funnest ive ever played with the graphical improvements over the console version making it even better! buy this game and you wont be sorry!",30.2

"gta v - pc an amazing masterpiece perfectly developed to pc. performance wise itself, its a majestic creation, the freedom of tweaking any graphical setup is just amazing, the game itself maximizes the potential every single aspect of your gpu & resources, unlike other games that play horribly even when you have an overkill rig, (im talking to you cod aw >.>), gta offers graphical optimization to its finest. no problems with launching or first time set ups. if you read the negative reviews, youll see how its mostly people complaining about launching problems or whatsoever, ask them about their rigs and you will know their problem, so make sure you meet the necessary requirements before you purchase the game, or else you will have a bad time, this is a really spec critical game, and if you have the minimal or recommended sepcs, be sure you know that only applies to low-medium range settings and dont expect to be able to max everything out. gameplay wise, day 2, so far, the game runs flawlessly, no glitches, no stuttering, no controls or any kind of issue, found. smooth 60 fps+, environment insanely gorgeous, people & animals look and feel natural, everything is so vivid, movement isnt as sloppy as the consoles versions, random events that happen all over los santos just pop out of nowhere, it is definitely worth the upgrade from xb1-ps4. you can feel the huge difference in performance & limitations that consoles had compared to pc, it is a whole new gta experience. in conclusion: gta v pc, what gta v was meant to be, it is definitely the definitive edition and more. 20/10 - im happy rockstar took all the time they needed to make of this game a masterpiece that it should have been in consoles.",6.6
"did the countdown from 10 mins before the release and actually started to tear up. then i manned the  up and played the first mission and almost cryed again. i had to stop because if a game can do that to me, i probably need to get a girlfriend. oh wait, gta v is out.... aint nobody got no time no more.",27.3
"looks amazing when i finally managed to stop it from crashing every 5 minutes. didnt seem to have any problems from r* social club either. like i said it looks incredible, i can nearly max it out with an amd r9 270x (make sure you download the updated drivers). pushing the textures detail up too high seems to make it a bit twitchy but still looks lovely. 10/10 would develop another stomach ulcer due to stress from figuring out why it kept crashing and thinking id just wasted 39.99 on an unplayable 60gb parasite again.",13.2

"i picked up gta 5 first on ps3, i gotta say, this ones alot better. theres more cars, more guns, better textures, higher framerate, better shooting, and a tiny eensy weensy bit more mature of a community. not alot though. maybe ive just been getting lucky. this is a really great game to let your shiney new high end video cards stretch their legs. at the time of writing this, i have a gtx770, and i usually get 58fps at high, but have chugging issues on ultra when speeding down a congested highway. other than that, the game runs fantastic. controlling the game is a bit odd, especially in first person. youre going to expect it to control like a halflife or any other fps, but you have to remember youre still controlling a 3d models animations from a different perspective, so it does take some getting used to. driving on a keyboard is a chore, but plug in your favorite controller and its as smooth as silk. car density is way up. car variety too. no longer will only mesas spawn till you hike through the woods. now dlc cars such as the panto, the alpine look alike, and the cheetah r spawn. traffic is now more erratic though. they will constantly juke to stay in your way, and ive had on multiple occasions oncoming dive into my lane across double yellows to hit me. enemy ai aim seems to of spikes violently too. as of the first week of launch, online is more or less as good if not a little worse than the ps3 version. i had one match where everything was stuttering around, but the others have been alright. there have been some freezing issues. the mod community as of right now is in its infancy and learning to walk all over again. i do however fear that installing mods in the future will get your online account banned, but only time will tell. so no super super fun mods just yet like we had for gta 4. all in all, i gotta recommend this game. it",71.1

"i previously owned this game on the xbox 360 platform, and i have to say is simply, wow. now, rockstar has really out done themselves, with a ton of graphical and other technical improvements from the first generation and e3 consoles. with the amazing attention to detail, this game is an amazing all around experience, with thousands of game play material ahead of you. if you are experiencing grand theft auto v for the first time, and are some how on the fence of buying this game, let me just tell you up and front. scrape up $60, and buy this amazing game. honestly, i cannot overstate enough, how beautiful this game looks. the water texture, and not to mention the rain and general overall physics of the game. with over a hundred cars and many exciting and unique planes, along with the free dlcs added on, this game will keep you busy for many years to come. now, lets not forget the story mode. the story mode, quite frankly, is only 69 missions. now, we you think of it in the context to the previous grand theft auto games, it may seem a little short. when in reality, every mission is carefully crated, and weaves all the characters perfectly into an amazing story line that seems to keep pulling you in deeper as you advance farther along into the story. the heists are amazing, fast paced, adrenaline rushing, and creative (since you get to plan the heists yourself). the only down side to this, (yet i cant blame rockstar) is how limited your planning can go, into creating your custom heist. with a plan and mostly guided missions and heists, in reality, you have very little decision making to do, (except for the end). with that out of the way, grand theft auto v still tops all of rockstars previous grand theft auto games. now on to grand theft auto: online. now, personally, im not the hugest fan of gta: o, and i have not invested myself in the online community. just because i dont play it that much, doesnt take the fact away that gta: o is well crafted and has a friendly interface and overall setup. you can do anything from playing fun, senseless deathmatches, to planning and executing heists with your friends. buying apartments and super cars is fulfilling, and satisfying when you look over that skyline of los santos. now, im not saying gta: o will be a joywalk, with level 150s shooting at you with their heavy snipers, blowing up anything they spot. it can be frusturating, but that should even heighten your drive to gain levels and rp, reaching the top of the food chain in los santos. this game is amazing, and i there are no major problems or criticisms i have. this game was masterfully crated, and has a well thoughtout map and infrastructure. yet, the one thing that i really ties the whole game together, is the attention to detail by rockstar. every graffti mark, crack, ditch, texture, blade of grass has been strategically placed there, just for your enjoyment. i give this game a 9.7/10, because i want to give rockstar that 0.3 to improve on, and give them an incentive to make an even better grand theft auto predecessor.",45.1

"gta has been a favorite series of mine since the first game. in those days, it was very convenient for party play-- pop in some cheats and hand off to the next person when you died. nobody did the missions except if you were the only one playing. this trend continued on into 2 and 3, where multiplayer either did not exist (or on pc, couldnt get it to work easily) or didnt matter. the real first experience with multiplayer i had was multi theft auto for vice city. from that moment on, the dream of multiplayer gta meant stupid, impossible feats. san andreas reached that peak in singleplayer but lacked multiplayer beyond co-op (sad). gta has many capacities: for gta v, you have to take the game as two seperate parts delineated on borders of functionality. gta online is to a lesser degree, an excellent game; however, the reason one would play gta online is because singleplayer, after finishing the story, becomes a dull, boring affair with little of the emergent content present in gtao. that emergent content, however, is dull, too, once youve become accustomed to it. if you have imagination, gta (any gta) can be enjoyable. i will discuss both gtao and gta v in each facet to help you determine whether this game is a heap of dog crap or a brilliant, postmodern mockery of sandbox games. first of all, gtao has microtransactions, and it is stupid. it goes against everything imaginable for a decent company like rockstar to engage in this nonsense-- microtransactions are a nuisance and a micro-economy of fake money injected into games using your real money. it is unscrupulous and unethical, and i think this personally, that it is a great, albeit evil, business model. gtao might be preying on stupid, casual, or lazy players who suck at gta, are 12 and have moms credit card, or weary, married-too-young males who work a lot and just buy their way to success in p2w games. still, endorsing a dave and busters style microeconomy of optional pay walls to content is tantamount to encouraging it, even if you plan to gain marginal sales on their shark cards (they made a lot of money, actually). gtao and singelplayer suffer from the same gameplay issues that every gta eventually runs into; gtao makes up for lack of minigames and activities by always adding more content over time. as of yet, singleplayer is dead due to no new content injection. a major change to the gameplay is the quality of graphics and the new viewpoint. the first-person view adds immense icing on the cake of new graphical fidelity which puts the game far ahead of any competitor. even when textures look like runny jpeg slosh, the after-effects and great breadth of options mean that even without texture modding, the game will look fine for quite a while. gta iv is still getting new leases on life because both games leave a lot of room for personal taste for modders to eventually exploit and manipulate to get more intensive graphics (yet to be seen, but the game just came out). the lowest generation versions (ps3 and 360) were quite bad looking, washy textures and terrible aliasing abounding, but the games still had excellent, visionary quality for that generations horribly gimped graphical power. its quite an achievement that even on low settings, the game is functional-- functional is the least i can say for games, since the last big sandbox games i played a lot, black flag and watchdogs, were pretty... pretty . they were functional messes at their best, and glitchy, contorted eppileptic siezures at worst. gta v on pc still has glitches (though i have had few pop-in issues) and crashing, but its far more stable than many multi-console port/mish-mash games ive been uncomfortable playing. a major issue i have with these games, that is gta vs various versions, is that as updates and content have been implemented, there is a major difference between singleplayer and multiplayer driving/handling configurations. cars go slow or faster depending on the patch, and theres awful discrepencies even in online alone between the lag you experience: when i do normal missions in full servers on this pc version, i rarely experience floating cars and pop-in. now, in every heist-related mission, there is lag, pop-in, invisible cars, and fgloating cars dropping in on me. consistent with ps3 (my previous generation version), rockstar expends a lot of energy issuing small one-day patches that clear up exploits and glitches-- but not ones that functionally break the game! no! they focus on exploits and hacking related to people griefing or making money (taking away from their shark card revenue) or duplicating cars. this goes hand-in-hand with contentious, still, approaches to bad sports. i have never even been fully on bad sport lobbies, but i hate that you cannot avoid it. accidental car destructiuon happens constantly. gta iv had many of the greater qualities that made fan-created multiplayer (especially samp) so much fun: in other words, we need to stop having draconian rules about personal-vehicles. implement a server list so people can implement rules like no cops or no personal vehicle insurance claims. being able to ban or give tanks to players outside of missions would be a plus; more control of the lobby-like free mode would make this game immensely better! gta iv multiplayer was enjoyable, yet i do not want to give up new ideas like persitant weapons or personal vehicles, but insurance and whatnot is so superfluous and pointless that i cannot stand it. i get it, rockstar! sticky bombing peoples cars in a game about robbery and murder is a bully behavior (from the guys who made a great game called bully). the soundtrack is excellent-- though, a lot of wierdness comes from the ambient soundtrack. i just wish there was a seperate soundbar for just that ambient music. the roster of artists is very good, varied, large. one feature i wish would one day be added is updates with new music after launch... a pipedream, i know, but gtao is being built on a longterm profit and update model. as for the sound effects, they are superb. the game has a quality more like gta iv, where i dont hear a lot of the sam pedestrian dialogue, but it also falls in line with an overly serious tone the game takes (no quotable dumb pedestrian lines). as for story- and this is my final topic- i can only be brief. theres many elements to the characterizations and the cast that makes the game a compelling game, and not some cinematic experience. there are definitely moments where it goes over into that territory but often this is temporary and is pointed out. we are not given characters that fall down under examination or have no criticism from the world beyond police and an antagonist. there is self-deprecation and there is deprecation from these characters families and friends. as for the preachy, left-wing/right-wing saoccer mom/social justice warrior critiques of this games treatment of lgbt topics: this game is incredibly fair and kind to everyone involved. major themes critique the protaganists, their society, and the enemies that motivate the main characters. youre going to feel sorry for things you do. i dont know how this is any less a story about reluctant criminals than the previous: in 3, its forced revenge to deal with a romantic betrayal. in vice city, its forced independence to escape your betrayers. in san andreas, its forced everything by everyone, often because of their crimes and weakness. gta iv was about an immigrant dealing with america, forced to flee his past. now we have three protaganists fitting these previous games (franklin and cj, michael and vercetti, trevor and claude). in closing, i give it a number out of a number. gta is still hectic, even if you dont like the hd era. its a ing parody of its own meaningless, plagiarized movie plots. online is fine and good, even when it disappoints... youll still play it. and wheres the co-op r*??? where?!",186.4

"(tl;dr: game is a masterpiece) after 18 months of delay after delay, gta v is finally here, and i can firmly say that it was worth the wait. the game is the best version to have come out. the game has delivered on everything that was promised and it runs like a dream. pros: 1. amazing gameplay: gun play is perfect and very fluid. playing in 1st person mode is incredible, and the mouse aiming is as good as it was max payne 3. driving in the game is fantastic. i use the m/k the whole time, even when driving. since i play in 1st person mode completely, i find that driving with a keyboard works really well. plus the cars are heavy and well balanced, so your car doesnt swerve all over the place like some do when you use a keyboard. 2. optimization: ive put many hours into the game so far, and apart from some early fps drops, i havent had any major issues. i run the game almost completely maxed out, with msaa turned off and advanced graphics turned off. the game offers you up one of the most detailed settings menu ive ever seen. from your standard graphics options, all the way to the number of people that appear on the screen. they took their time and truly did a wonderful job. 3. story: one of the biggest issues i had with gta 4 was the boring story and protagonist. luckily, r* fixed this by adding three playable characters, all with their own unique skills and missions. the game combines the three quite well, so you never feel like is less significant than the other. even though the game centers around michaels life and problems, the story very naturally intertwines the other two in there perfectly. 4. gta online: i havent spent much time in this, but from what ive been able to do, it seems pretty good. this is the weakest part of the game imo, but thats mostly because im not a big fan of mp. i havent done the heist yet, but from what ive seen, it seems like it was worth the wait. cons: 1. cant think of anything major tbh. not saying the game is flawless, but there is nothing major that ive come across that i would put as a con. while this game isnt perfect, and i wouldnt put it in my top 5, it is still a masterpiece of a game that will appeal to just about everyone. while the game had a rocky launch, it seems to be running well for almost everyone now. so please dont listen to those people who gave it a negative review on day 1 because they couldnt get on. i understand their pain, but the game runs and plays like a dream, so dont deny yourself this amazing experience just because a few people drew the short straw. for me, this game is a solid 10/10.",18.3

"i got into the gta series with gta 3, a very long time ago. it was fun, then vc came out, they improved on it, slightly. it was also fun. then rockstar decided to up the duty on the series and released sa. now that was major fun. you could fly, you could swim, you could dive, you could do so much. and it was a story mode based game, but in a sandbox form. you could go anyplace, do anything. it really changed the way games are made. in my opinion. rockstar then screwed up with gta iv, forcing everyone into a world where the game could only be played online. no way to play it offline. they improved the graphics, but screwed up the game play with such things as plane and heli controls. in that, rockstar has once again failed. forcing everyone into the social club to be able to play a game they just spent 60 bucks on. the social club is the biggest waste that i have seen out of the folks at rockstar. but really no other real complaints to be said. however. rockstar truly stepped up with the sandbox form of game world, while keeping the story mode like they did in sa. the world is massive, its a thrill, the graphics are beyond belief. the game ai seems to have been changed, tweeked and improved. rockstar added in cats, deer, dogs, even rats running around in los santos. and i still keep finding things in the game world that i never thought possible in a game like this. gta v is one spectacular achievement in game world physics, game play and with the sandbox enviroment. rockstar truly has redefined the bar, yet again. since gta v unlocked for pc on steam, i have put in 18 hrs, split between story mode and in the online world. and this is an achievement beyond anything i could have imagined. it behaves much like sa, and that has really drawn me in. but this isnt sa, this is 1,000 times better. i will miss my old sa, but gta v has drawn me in. im hooked.",63.8

"a game by rockstar studios. he is an adventure game with a lot to see. if you are a fan of grand theft auto and you didnt buy it, you made a mistake. all of the old features are there with more, except now the graphics are good, the online is a bit better. new to grand theft auto ?the main point of the game. it is a sandbox, you can get some guns, cars, bombs. you have a huge and super detailed map to play in, almost every city block there are side streets, alleyways with cover, almost every building you can climb onto the roof from the ground level, if not, you can just park a car near one of the ledges to get up. if you are bored a great way to kill time is to see if you can survive the high wanted levels, to do it just find some enemies or police characters, shoot them, you have three stars and now you just have to survive for long enough to get 4 and 5. but, be careful because early in the game you wont have many guns or ammunition, and even if you get some armor, you will die quickly. you will learn fast that to survive a gunfight in gta you must aim to swiftly kill enemies before they swarm you and always be in cover. only show yourself to the enemy you are currently shooting, and only let him see you for as long as it takes you to kill him. - wise words by unkown authors. for returning player: old controls - you can still run and jump into enemies to knock them over/stumble. shotguns still very powerful, computer enemies can kill you in 2 hits so beware. headshots are instant kill with any weapon. and i think if you even have body armor even the smallest pistol will do it. there is still a purpose for shooting at bodies though because most guns can kill in 5 to 6 shots, as for computer enemies they will take an entire magazine to the chest yes, but you will knock them over, and buy yourself time if you been caught off guard. blind shooting form cover became much more powerful you can consistently score headshots on far away enemies and you should abuse the opportunity. remember how even in gta 3 if you are on a bike doing a wheelie. you want to get over a low wall by hitting the bike against the wall and gliding over. you can still do it. but be careful, on your bike if you go off a huge jump even if you land on both wheels you can die insta unless something breaks your fall. melee- one of the biggest changes to combat is how melee works. now melee is very powerful. attacks against enemies who are not facing you will hit harder. against computer enemies/pedestrians who are not aware of your presence it will always be a one shot kill even if you have no weapon. sprinting into an enemy to attack them will trigger a charge attack that takes some extra time but lets you lock onto them from afar and guarantee a hit. against pedestrians this is almost always a one hit kill, though sometimes cops will survive a knife to the gut, just hit them again as they will be stunned. if you have a firearm of any sort, a melee attack is almost always going to one shot kill, if not it will knock the enemy on the ground not just stumble them back. also dodging will no longer fail if you already pressed space to dodge but did it at the wrong time, it will still work now, you can even counter because it will break the enemys attack animations up just the same. so in the melee you have much more options now, but be careful, because bullets travel faster than fists. this said. grand theft is known for somewhat laggy multiplayer. you will every now and then see someone teleporting around even if you are in their car. it is one of the most complicated games ever guaranteed much more is going on than any other game adventure or not. expect it respect and just get used to it. i mention it now because, as melee is powerful, you can expect to really get killed in stupid ways by melee in online just rare. there is really no skill to melee in pvp due to lag and teleports. if you go to the gladiator arena this is my suggestion: gang up vs. enemies, never attempt 1v1 unless you do charge attack from behind, because more are coming, you will get swamped extremely fast because their charge attack will let them teleport on you and you cannot dodge 4 people for long. spam your dodge (space by default) and counter if you need to. but most importantly. dont put yourself in a place to get hit in the first place, unless your goal is to soak up hits and focus on dodging blows so your friends can hit them more easily, enemies who are attacking cannot dodge. you dont need to ancitipate attacks to dodge, as i said before, just mash space, you will be fine. but expect to die even if you are being very safe, do not get mad if you do, just keep playing, gta is a hectic game of killing and dying and dont let those mlg kids fool you, it is ok to lose if you had fun. but especially for melee, you cannot always control your fate. the game decides when a melee strike is going to hit the target as soon as it is launched. nothing, not even walls or other players will stop the hit. meaning you are guaranteed to die eventually as someone will lock on all of those things they did not have support for now supported. for example you are now allowed to tab out of the game when you are on multiplayer, it wont kick you anymore, in case you are in need of a guide, or pictures of what that apartment you are buying looks like, where to find that car (some cars seen more in certain areas), etc not sure about mod support. but you can chose your own spots for deathmatches, define the rules, where the pick-ups are, and place vehicles and ai down. it is simple to download them with rockstar gamings new social club thing. there are some cool maps like rifles vs. racers where rifles are using snipers on top of a floating platform in the sky and the racers need to do stunt jump to try and ram them off the platform or land on it, jump out, and knife them. both hard to do. it can even be fun in 4v4 but rifles almost always win, with more players it becomes much more difficult to dodge the flying cars as the snipers. performance - i am on some old hardware, some new. but i am running the game at a good framerate. if you are worried gta will not run you are probably just guessing, because my friend has an i2 processor and i have i3 now and we are both running the game fine dual core and all. i can even record the game in 60 fps not talking about the action replay either. if you could run gta iv, you can run this, but better, because it is a more optimized game overall. same with max payne, if you can run it, you can run this. even the video rendering is quicker, and you get the option for the renderer to do your video in max graphics, in case you are like me, just using budget pc. videos look great in rockstar rendered for this reason. new video editor is much more responsive than old one, with many more options. one new thing you can do is add a score track what is an easily modifiable song. you can change its intensity, so for one part of your clip you can have slower quieter music, and you can build it up to its max intensity for your most important scenes. you can also now skip to the time of the next beat with the press of a button, so to sync up your video to your music, is much easier. beware video recorders, if you record in first person you cannot change the camera angle in the editor, it will be locked. the real truth is at this point gta 4 is a tech demo compared to this game. if you liked the way red dead redemption controlled, then you are in for a treat, the game is just as good. and if you are a real gta fan you will buy this game as it is all improved. the only reason to not buy it is if you are waiting for a sale as summer is right around the corner. will rockstar studios let us do mods in the future, i dont know, but if they add more freedom to the ingame creator tools so far it will almost forgive that little mistake.",80.7

"at the point of this writing, i have put over 32 hours into this game so far, i have only completed about 30-32% of the single player and i havent touched the multi player as of yet. the game is so much fun its insane. the music and talk programs grab my attention so much that all i do is ride around on motorcycles and listen to them. they are a few minor issues like random frame drops, but they are more annoying than game breaking. this is a great port; i highly recommend buying this game. 8/10. p.s: give my bro trevor some love too, just like franklin",37.4

"i havent fully played a grand theft auto game since vice city. my friends have been raving about grand theft auto 5 and i was on the fence about it because i outgrew the game and wasnt my cup of tea anymore (i was wrong). i took a chance and bought it and wow i do not regret my purchase one bit! :d the world looks beautiful (granted if you have a decent pc rig to play it), the game mechanics are pretty fluid, missions are creative, and the story is fantastic! i was never really interested in the story much for the past gta ive played, but this one has gotten me hooked. the characters are very memorable and well developed, you can easily connect with them at all times. i havent ran into many bugs (yet) in the main story mode. the online experience so far is so-so. the open world and missions that you do are pretty fun against other players. although it gets really laggy and glitchy often whenever i play with some friends, not sure why this happens, but it does kill the mood a little bit. overall though, its decent, but if youre in it for just the online multiplayer portion then i would probably wait a little bit until things get fixed and optimized. again thats just my experience, i would do a little more research about online experiences from others before purchasing. honestly, with that little negative asside i could go on and on about how awesome this game is, but that would turn this mini review into a book. if you dont mind the violence, (lots of) swear words, drugs, etc... then this is a game for you and a must buy :d",17.5

"i got into the gta series with gta 3, a very long time ago. it was fun, then vc came out, they improved on it, slightly. it was also fun. then rockstar decided to up the duty on the series and released sa. now that was major fun. you could fly, you could swim, you could dive, you could do so much. and it was a story mode based game, but in a sandbox form. you could go anyplace, do anything. it really changed the way games are made. in my opinion. rockstar then screwed up with gta iv, forcing everyone into a world where the game could only be played online. no way to play it offline. they improved the graphics, but screwed up the game play with such things as plane and heli controls. in that, rockstar has once again failed. forcing everyone into the social club to be able to play a game they just spent 60 bucks on. the social club is the biggest waste that i have seen out of the folks at rockstar. but really no other real complaints to be said. however. rockstar truly stepped up with the sandbox form of game world, while keeping the story mode like they did in sa. the world is massive, its a thrill, the graphics are beyond belief. the game ai seems to have been changed, tweeked and improved. rockstar added in cats, deer, dogs, even rats running around in los santos. and i still keep finding things in the game world that i never thought possible in a game like this. gta v is one spectacular achievement in game world physics, game play and with the sandbox enviroment. rockstar truly has redefined the bar, yet again. since gta v unlocked for pc on steam, i have put in 18 hrs, split between story mode and in the online world. and this is an achievement beyond anything i could have imagined. it behaves much like sa, and that has really drawn me in. but this isnt sa, this is 1,000 times better. i will miss my old sa, but gta v has drawn me in. im hooked.",64.0

"almost exactly 1 week since the game released and i have now clocked 100 hours in the game, so heres my impressions so far. and i have exclusively played online, gonna wait with the story. so grand theft loadi.... auto online. +heists when i read there were gonna be 5 heists, 4 of winch require the full 4 player line-up i was worried you would play them once and thats it, never gonna do them again. but i have played all of them twice and i can see myself play them even more trying to get all the challenges. and the job r* made on the heists are superb, good design, good voice acting from the characters that do talk. +leveling on my 100hours in online i reached rank 50 and i didnt play jobs or heists all the time, many hours spent just exploring, so you can reach 50 a lot faster if you want. and i think thats a reasonable leveling pace, not to quick so that you unlock everything instantly and not to slow so you lose interest. +jobs there are a lot of different job types as its called, game mode in gta iv. race, capture, deathmatch and so on. on very neat feature is on call, you cue up and joins a lobby but youre not transfered into the job until the host starts. so no waiting in the lobby. the jobs them self is fun and big plus, but is haunted by the next thing, the loading times. +daily objectives feels like im playing wow. the game features 3 daily objectives which will give you cash and rp (xp). completing them a week in a row will grant you even more cash and rp and a month in a row even more. this is a nice thing to do as they often are fairly easy, like participate in a race. this could also act as a way to get players to log on daily and then think might as well play some more. -loading times the loading times in this game are insane, it takes so long to switch from a job back to freemode or the other way around. also the startup time can be pretty brutal, longest this far is 4minutes, but that could have been the servers being slow. but overall loading times are long, so dont be in a hurry. (-)glitches now this will probably differ from person to person so this is just from my experience. there are some glitches that are more game breaking then other. one of them being when you die during a heist or setup to a heist. all you see is a image your character, but you can still see the hud such as the mini map. this is avoided by someone else in your heist crew committing suicide. not all get this glitch, only me and 2 other friends get it, but 5 other friend dont get it. (-)performance again, this may very and it could be my computer, but i would expect higher performance from my rig. its most notable when leaving the city to drive out to the desert, the fps drop to 40-60fps and it feels like im on a ps3 or x360. the online is a solid 9/10, high replay value on the heists and hopefully some more will come later on. glitches, some small and some bigger is what takes of the last point. rig: i7 2600k 16gb ram gtx980 sli 1680x1050 resolution",101.6

"this story starts with a cat, and how curiosity killed it. ... ive enjoyed playing through the gta v story so far, but the event that stuck with me the next day probably wasnt intended by the scriptwriters. instead, the fate of one cat set loose many questions. the event in question happens just after taking control of franklin, before you steal a couple of supercars. a couple of cats are hanging around in the back garden of the property youre about to steal the cars from. as a cat person, i naturally approach the cats to see how they behave and if they could be interacted with. the simple answer was no, franklin clearly had no intention of touching the cats, and after trying to get close to one of them a few times, the cat got spooked. what i didnt entirely expect were the events that happened next. the cat bolted out of the alleyway, by which point i was busy getting franklin involved in his caper. however, i was promptly distracted by a soft thud and the cursing of a truck driver. looking up, i saw the truck slowly pulling away, leaving behind a small furry corpse that just moments ago had been at my feet. i didnt have much time to mourn at the time, but looking back on it, i cant help feel some remorse over my involvement in the (virtual) animals death, nor slightly affected by franklins indifference. it makes me wonder, when such a dynamic event occurs, how deep the simulation really goes. i know its unlikely, but i wonder for a minute if there was a family waiting for that cat to return. would i start seeing missing cat signs in the neighbourhood? was the truck driver emotionally affected by the experience? the answer to these is probably no, but perhaps one day this is something a more deeper simulation will hypothesise. until then, the memory of the cat i accidentally killed will probably stay with me throughout my playthrough. theres probably some irony that a game that necessarily has you kill hundreds of human beings intentionally, could affect me more by making me complicit in the accidental death of an animal.",26.8

"so far, most of the negative critics are due they cannot run the game, or play it fluently. and this is (hopefully) an issue that will be fixed. however, how many bad critics are due to the game is bad? gentlemen, so far ive seen none. and its for a good damn reason, bioshock infinite has a good story (well yes it does)? pfft! the last of us, game of the decade? pfft! ladies and horses, we have a game that truly goes into the interest of a gamer, and im not referring to a fancy list of needs such as artistic, inspiring or any liberal crap like that. we have a game that along with mortal kombat has been the king of controversy, a game that allow us to become mr. hide. a game that enforce us to torture some  guantanamo-style. a well done game, that allow us to fulfill the basic needs of senseless violence with tons of complete fun. im not talking about saints row, im not talking about skyrim, im not talking about hatred, im not even talking about postal. damn i am talking about mothering gta5. many games sells by its name and company legacy, but end up being anual crap like call of duty or assassins creed. the people in rockstar, they love us, they dont do crap in any sense of the word. they even take many years and delays (to anger of many) just to polish better the diamond. they even do the sacrifice to put a 2-year beta on consoles, just to make for us (the pc race) a pure sexual experience. nevertheless, many could not run it on day one. i could, and i have kind of a crappy pc. (amd fx6300 at 3.5 ghz, 4gb ddr3, windows 7m, a cheap gigabyte motherboard and a geforce gt 640).  i can run it decently. and i can tell that even when i played the game with my xbox 360. the story is good, you get killed without reason in the multiplayer, tons of stereotypes if our modern society, 1 black, 1 middle aged, 1 sociopath and lots of hookers. explore a satirical (yet accurate) representation of a rotten modern society, where people is moved like cattle. politicians and religions throw out  everybody believes. new generations are driving everything to . technologies are beyond human control and drugs are the the fastest growing market. huge sandbox map, with tons of random things and extras. a large single player campaign with tons of extra , an immersive role play in the multiplayer (with an actual history development) that makes you feel you are part of the game. cars, tanks, dogs and drugs, you have it all!",23.5
"update: game is finally functional. in order to get it to work i had to completely reformat my hard drive and do a clean install. i guess that rockstar cant manage to get through the same compatibility issues that even small indie developers have long since figured out. im changing my recommendation because this game is amazing, but i am seriously unhappy about the issues that arose during this whole process. ========================================================================= 5 days and still no fix. even though the game was purchased through steam youre redirected to the rockstar social club in order to play the game. whenever social club is launched it crashes before you ever get into game. ive spent a week attempting every voodoo fix people have conjoured up and nothing works. the biggest kicker is that once *just once* i got a little bit further than an immediate crash when i tried loading the game in steam offline mode, but the rockstar drm then indicated that i couldnt log in because i had to log in at least once in online mode before i could get into the offline version ...which is impossible due to the crashes. 5 gd days guys. i understand that this effects a fairly small minority of people, but you would think that with billions of dollars made off this game that you would be able to get people to actually play the @#$% thing within the first week of release. congrats on out ubisofting ubisoft",11.9

"not much has to be said about the grand theft auto series, as rockstar always manages to deliver an outstanding experience. the single-player campaign starts slow and somewhat lackluster, but eventually builds momentum as youre introduced to more exciting personalities and missions. some of the story elements are oddly written at times and feel a bit off enough to kill the excitement. the second half of the game is pretty on-point with no real complaints. lots of great dialogue and setpiece moments, as expected. tons of content here, even if you just do the main story missions... expect 20 hours or more of gameplay just for the main story. gta online leaves a lot to be desired. getting into a game with friends can be a real challenge sometimes. starting missions and heists causes you and others to connect to a new game instance. the swapping from freeroam to missions and back causes so many loading screens that it gets really obnoxious really quickly. when you go back to freeroam there is no guarantee youre even playing with the same people you were originally. its a real headache just trying to do a variety of things with friends. console players are also allowed to transfer their characters over, meaning you could be facing level 100+ people as a person who just started playing for the first time. the online mode should have been done differently, more like how apb handles it. its a real letdown, but still can be good fun if you enjoy the sandboxing. overall, its gta on pc. it looks great and it runs great. definitely worth the money.",47.2

"i have been playing this game since its original launch, i went to the midnight release for the 360 and powered through story mode/single player and all it had to offer it for nearly a week. i played online mode the minute it was released, suffering through the crippling server issues that it had. with all of the problems during its launch aside, i had an amazing experience. i felt this was really the first next gen game that i had the chance to play. the ps4 had launched shortly after in november and i awaited its release. again, i played this game religiously on the ps4 during its debut. with all of the being said, i pre-ordered this game for the pc (the third time for me) and patiently awaited its release. thus far i am having an amazing time. the game is polished, great, fun and runs flawlessly on my setup. the heists are amazing and social club is integrated nicely into the game. my only complaint would be that i wish there would have been a small tutorial or side note stating how to access the social club menu and that friends/crews can be modified only via the social club menu. a note for the people giving it negative reviews; for the people who cannot run this due to your hardware not being able to handle the game. plain and simple, you should have read the requirements. this game is graphics intensive and requires a pc that can handle it. i personally would not try to run this game on laptop unless i was running an i7 with dedicated video cards. for the people who are complaining about the crappy community. this is gta. if you are looking for a peaceful hand-holding experience there are many casual and team-oriented games on steam that might suit you better. you can also trigger online solo-play via the single player online options. for the people who simply cannot play this game due to crashes and other things that are beyond your control. i can understand your frustration and hope that the game will be able to be ran for you in the future. it really is a great experience and it would be shame that a rocky launch would sully the potential experience. thank you rockstar for another great game in a franchise that has kept me entertained since 2001.

( when the servers work(but i only had 1 disconnect so far)) id advise everyone that likes action games to buy this amazing piece of software. 10/10 recommended",51.2

"although ive already bought and played grand theft auto v on the xbox 360; i was always anticipating the release of the pc version, and now that its here i can definitely say that there have been some major improvements to the game. aside from all the expected bugs and difficulties on getting into gta v and gta online at launch that many people, including myself, have been experiencing; this has definitely got to be the best instalment of the grand theft auto franchise yet. i have nothing but high expectations for future updates, releases and most importantly - mods that can be legally applied to the game without breaching any terms of service. as long as rockstar acknowledges and allows them first, of course. all in all - grand theft auto v is a game thats worth buying as theres pretty much a slice of everything for everyone. dont like doing missions? theres racing. dont like racing? do stunt runs. no stunts? then theres matchmaking. not to mention that the map is fairly large and offers many sights to see and places to explore. perfect for the adventurous types. and if all else fails; you can easily walk into ammunation, stock up on weapons and ammo and go out on a murder spree... in a tank... escorted by two armoured trucks, two fighter jets, a buzzard helicopter and a school bus full of murderous savages. just dont be alarmed if you experience any bugs. as i said - theyre to be expected at launch and will most likely all be patched up before you know it. i had to install the game twice in order for it to run perfectly fine, due to a faulty installation from pre-loading the game which caused roads, buildings and vehicles to vanish and reappear. why am i even reviewing this? grand theft auto is and always has been a great series. stop looking in the comments for pros and cons and just go ahead and grab it, play it for yourself and enjoy all that it has to offer. your steam library just isnt complete without it.",99.0

"ok, not much i can say about gta v at this time since this is the first time that ive ever placed it as i dont own a console and have been staying away from spoilers as best i could while i patiently waited for them to finally confirm and release to pc. frankly though, theres not much i need to say since most of us already know what gta is, so ill just give a break down of what i think about the game so far on my rig. so first of all i am running an i5 3570k processor at stock with turbo enabled, along with a gtx 760 video card with 2 gigs vram and 8 gigs of installed ram. i must say to rockstar, excellent job on optimising this game for pc, but the graphics to me were overhyped. graphics are nice at 1080p, but when i compare the graphics of gta v pc to watch_dogs pc with similar settings i must give watch_dogs the win for this one in terms of graphics, but watch_dogs was not optimised so that might explain why they dumbed down gta vs graphics. the presentation of this game is as top notch as expected and the first few minutes ive been playing i am really feeling this game. the driving is ok, but takes some getting used to. so far these are my ratings for the game and might change as i keep playing and experimenting: graphics - 8/10 sound - 10/10 gameplay - 9/10",40.3

"~mixed review~ (so has to get a thumbs down) -the good- 1. game looks good 2. the tps elements arent bad 3. has the general gta feel. -the bad- 1. driving is often sloppy due to character skillz. - pretty huge component of a gta game could have just left this stat out altogether. car handling would have been ample enough. 2. characters fit typified stereotypes. -the ugly- (everything below, i would consider pretty ing basic design elements for games) 1. no defaults for user preference settings (e.g. racing - no radio station) - it doesnt even care to remember your previous settings. 2. automatically defaults you into populated lobbies after a job. if i wanted to be in a populated server i would have selected it from the start! 3. single player: required drm (is this still working out for anyone? apart from steam.) 4. friendlist is less than intuitive. while i get they want you to manage things with your phone. it would make sense to have those options that dont tie directly to your character but your account in the game over menu. (your element is in the wrong spot!) a good compromise would to have it in both locations. hows about integrating it with already existing systems, i dunno like friends on steam. >.> 5. pay2win... how about um... no? 6. grind rank along with cash hurray. other  -pc launch, online problems you do pre-sales for a reason. yes to pad your wallet with fat stacks of paper. however, it is also a good way for you to gauge launch day server load",36.7

"grand theft auto v is an open world, action-adventure video game developed by rockstar north and published by rockstar games. set within the fictional state of san andreas (based around southern california), the single-player story follows three criminals and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from the government agency. the open world design lets players freely roam san andreas, which includes open countryside and the fictional city of los santos (based on los angeles). the game is played from either third-person or first-person view, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. you control the three lead protagonists throughout the single-player mode switching between them both during and outside of missions. the story is centred on the heist sequences, many of the missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. outside of missions, you can freely roam the big open world. mostly composed of the san andreas open countryside area and fictional city of los santos, the world of grand theft auto v is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series. the single-player mode lets players control three characters: michael de santa, trevor philips and franklin clinton criminals whose stories interconnect as they complete missions. you can use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies, and may run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate the world. throughout single-player, you may switch between the protagonists at will by using directional compass on the hud. the game may switch between the characters automatically in single-player missions to complete the objectives. a characters compass avatar will flash red if is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a advantage. overall i give gta v a 9/10 stars it is a huge improvement to its predecessor. i absolutely recommend you get this game because i am just absolutely without single doubt sure that grand theft auto v will not disappoint you in anyway at all!.",98.6

"this indie gem created by up-and-coming developer rockstars interactive has received mixed reviews, but im here to tell you not to listen to the unwashed masses. gta v has you play as three characters: miguel, frankie and tevor. starting as trevor, the goal is to roam the city to steal as much cars as possible (hence the games name - grand theft auto). as you get better at stealing cars you unlock miguel and franklin and their respective criminal activities (child slave trafficing and explosives smuggling). the game takes a dark turn towards the end where you must streamline your child trafficing methods to be able to compete with the chinese, meaning cramping them in smaller spaces and giving them worse and worse conditions. a real eye opener to the people unaware of these real issues you and i as world citizens face today. the games message does however get a bit hamfisted toward the end where you spend an entire mission beating the living  out of asian children to heart tugging music (i disabled the music in the audio options but it plays in this section regardless). you cant skip this part, but i get why the game has such a high age restriction after getting maximum score on the mission. great game, but its pretty graphic so take the age restriction seriously.",73.4

"initial impressions of the port after a few hours gameplay. i have an i7 4770 and gtx 780. i have almost everything maxed at ultra or very high apart from nvidia shadows and high definition shadows. the game runs between 40fps at its occasional lowest and 80 fps at its highest. it levels most of the time at around 50-60fps. considering the leaps and bounds in graphic fidelity compared to even the current gen versions on consoles which ran at 30fps, i am very happy with how the game performs. as for the quality of the game, well the 4 hours ive played so far seem very good and is a promising start. ive seen some having issues with social club login which they need to fix and for some reason steam overlay hides a crucial button during activation in social club which makes no sense but apart from that i had zero issues and logs in all the time before the first splash screen appears for me. update 12 hours in: frame rates take a massive nose dive once reaching the country and moving from the city. turning the grass to very high from ultra can claw some frames back but im willing to play with the sub 30fps due to how nice it all looks. the game is still great and the mission variety has begun to open up now, including my first raid which was brilliant, made difficult by the fact i took an inexperienced hacker who alerted the cops before i was done. so far my favourite gta since vice city.",34.4
"gta - v, good game for those who like open-free roaming sandbox games, however do not trust all the reviews saying this game is bug free. at first (i mostly play online) there were no bugs at all until i hit level 8. then it started as you can see in the list below: - upon death camera would freeze on the death screen preventing you from seeing where you were going after you respawn. - heist sequencing bugs out and cutscenes play in the wrong order. - random disconnections due to an unknown error on the server. - game crashes due to rockstar games social club errors. pros: - open gameplay and tons of activities to do. - lots of ingame content. - game looks beautiful and runs smoothly (well optimised). - controles are good, however flight might take abit of getting used to. cons: - game can feel like a grind to unlock more stuff and earn money. - after you complete all the activities a few times the game can feel boring. - initial loading takes a long time, ive had to sit and wait for the game to load for about 1-2 mins (and that is with an i7-4790k, 16gb ram at 1600mhz and a gtx 780 ti 3gb). - ingame loading takes a long time, about 30 secs to 1 min. - people will randomly leave your server in mass waves, leaving you on your own. - transition from loading to playing is cool at first, but the entire thing takes up 5-10 seconds and becomes monotonous after awhile. my recommendation: if you enjoyed previous gtas then i would recommend you wait till around may-june 2015 to buy this game so that most of the bugs are fixed. if you did not enjoy previous gtas so much then i would recommend that you wait for the game to go on sale.",31.9

"lets start this review off by saying that im playing the game on a hp pavillion hpe pre-built computer, which is the pinnacle of outdated rigs. my geforce gtx 550 ti wasnt made for this, not at all. ive been running the game in a borderless 4:3 window with most graphics settings on normal (which is the lowest setting) to keep the game stable around 30 fps. heres the deal though; ive been having an absolutely great time playing the game regardless. the controls are great and the game looks very good, even on the lowest settings. ive already played through the story before on console, so ive been spending most of my time in gta online, which does have the occasional connection problems. problems which are likely attributed to the high load on the rockstar servers. all in all, the pc version definitely has issues. however, the pc version is definitely better than the console versions were and is one of the best (if not the best) aaa games released so far in 2015. of course, opinions may vary and the best way to find out would be playing it yourself. ps: loading screens.",24.5

"played roughly 200 hours when it launched on the xbox 360, loved it, and now its finally back in its definitive edition and all them console peasants be like ay bruh thas some nice graphics u got ther and we be like well you know, just some normal pc master race thing, nothing special. but yeah honestly, its impressive, and having a good pc like i do makes it even better, it runs great with everything maxed out *cough*unlike gta iv*cough* and the time we waited to have it on pc was definitely worth it. some people are having some hardware issues, but you know, its pretty normal with games on day one nowadays. im currently experiencing some horrible mouse acceleration and fps drops in the menu, but this will get fixed eventually. bottom line : if you havent played it on console yet, buy it, if you played it on the xbox 360, buy it, if you have xbone/ps4... well, theres no real reason to buy except for the slightly better graphics so unless you have a potato, go for it if you have the money and the power to run it at 60fps high/ultra.",70.6

"summary: -game is good fun and in greater quality than ever seen before in a gta game. - steering wheel and flight stick is not supported though which is a shame. - people got problems making their laptop gpu running the game. gta is gta, you run around blow up stuff, doing missions, climbing the ranks and making cash. the game has got crazy characters and during the game you get to play as different characters with different lives. despite this during game they will meet and work together to achieve their goals. when you arent doing missions, there is also tons of activities you can do. my overall impression is that gta 5 is just a little bit different in terms of features, compared to gta 5, but it still feels way more fun and overall higher quality.",40.7

"couldnt wait for this to come on and now that its out i can say it is worth it. running the game on maxed settings is bliss and the controls for the mouse and keyboard are league better than using a controller. even though i have played gta 5 across 2 generations of consoles and clocked over 200 hours on it i can say without a doubt that the pc is the true version. rockstar have made an amazing port to the pc. went straight into online with no problems and a full game straight away. cant wait to play it more and with friends when they have downloaded it.",18.4
"once upon a time in a realm called the internet, not so far away yet so secluded, there was a mad king. and the mad king used to be a peasant. that is why hes been discriminating any other monarchs and lords who called themselves the masterrace. its been a while and, after a lot of pressure, the king announced equality amongst all his people. all the peasants who laughed at the masterrace shook in fear, hearing that the already superior lords would get the only thing that made them unique. but it was only a tease, the masterrace, prepearing for a feast got destroyed economically by the king, who tricked them into paying for equality, but denied them the service afterwards. the masterrace, in its glory, wasnt fased though, they survived the backstab and continued on living, waiting for the promised, sweet, equality to happen. and then after years of anticipation, the mad old king once again promised equality. this time it seemed more reasonable and the mad king even offered a reward for every lord that would support the kings campaign into achieving equality. and so it happened, thousands upon thousands of members of the masterrace payed the king. yet the king, who managed to decieve the lords, postponed equality once again. the masterrace, now furious, felt exploited, like a cheap . every lord in the steaming lands of a star made out of rock prepared for a riot. and after months of preparation, days before the attack, there it was again. the ultimate tease, equality right beneath the masterraces palm, like eves forbidden fruit. so tempting that riots were called to stop because of the hypnotizing countdown. and there it was. the peasants fear, the masterraces glory. the edict. the only thing that could make countries go to war and declare peace. gta v, the declaration of equality. the mads kind fetish that used to be a way to play around with lords like lab mice. equality ... to be honest though,  console peasants, pc masterrace for the win!",53.5

"initial impressions of the port after a few hours gameplay. i have an i7 4770 and gtx 780. i have almost everything maxed at ultra or very high apart from nvidia shadows and high definition shadows. the game runs between 40fps at its occasional lowest and 80 fps at its highest. it levels most of the time at around 50-60fps. considering the leaps and bounds in graphic fidelity compared to even the current gen versions on consoles which ran at 30fps, i am very happy with how the game performs. as for the quality of the game, well the 4 hours ive played so far seem very good and is a promising start. ive seen some having issues with social club login which they need to fix and for some reason steam overlay hides a crucial button during activation in social club which makes no sense but apart from that i had zero issues and logs in all the time before the first splash screen appears for me. update 12 hours in: frame rates take a massive nose dive once reaching the country and moving from the city. turning the grass to very high from ultra can claw some frames back but im willing to play with the sub 30fps due to how nice it all looks. the game is still great and the mission variety has begun to open up now, including my first raid which was brilliant, made difficult by the fact i took an inexperienced hacker who alerted the cops before i was done. so far my favourite gta since vice city.",34.4
"gta - v, good game for those who like open-free roaming sandbox games, however do not trust all the reviews saying this game is bug free. at first (i mostly play online) there were no bugs at all until i hit level 8. then it started as you can see in the list below: - upon death camera would freeze on the death screen preventing you from seeing where you were going after you respawn. - heist sequencing bugs out and cutscenes play in the wrong order. - random disconnections due to an unknown error on the server. - game crashes due to rockstar games social club errors. pros: - open gameplay and tons of activities to do. - lots of ingame content. - game looks beautiful and runs smoothly (well optimised). - controles are good, however flight might take abit of getting used to. cons: - game can feel like a grind to unlock more stuff and earn money. - after you complete all the activities a few times the game can feel boring. - initial loading takes a long time, ive had to sit and wait for the game to load for about 1-2 mins (and that is with an i7-4790k, 16gb ram at 1600mhz and a gtx 780 ti 3gb). - ingame loading takes a long time, about 30 secs to 1 min. - people will randomly leave your server in mass waves, leaving you on your own. - transition from loading to playing is cool at first, but the entire thing takes up 5-10 seconds and becomes monotonous after awhile. my recommendation: if you enjoyed previous gtas then i would recommend you wait till around may-june 2015 to buy this game so that most of the bugs are fixed. if you did not enjoy previous gtas so much then i would recommend that you wait for the game to go on sale.",31.9
"a game that will no doubt provide incredibly memorable experiences from trying for an hour to get a sailboat over a bridge with a cargo bob to get it out of a lake only to find theres a second bridge down the line, to going through hell to steal a motorcycle from the lost but then finding out you cant keep their version of that motorcylce, to spending hours driving back and forth to get a car you want to spawn then seeing it all the damn time after you finally have it. despite the uncountable moments of blind rage this game has given me, its truly an amazing game with something to offer for everyone, so get it dammit!",39.4

"i can only wish that people would have tried to fix their problems before leaving bad reviews... the fact is, gta v is, perhaps, one of the greatest modern games to come to the pc. the defining next-gen title, if you ask me. but its prestige and merit has been drowned by individuals leaving negative reviews because of the games rough start, which is why i come out of the woodworks to leave this review. the fact is, since i played this game on xbox 360, i was captivated by the plot. something so masterful and elegant had never been seen before in the video gaming world at the time, and even at the games release on the pc nearly two years later, it remains amongst the top tier titles. this game runs wonderfully on hardware that it normally wouldnt be able. this is because rockstar has pulled off an incredible feat and showed the rest of the gaming world what a pc port should look like. people insult rockstar and say that they dont care, yet they have delivered a beacon of hope to those of us who have been observing a disappointing lack of care on behalf of developers when it comes to moving games from consoles to pcs. this game is a must have. the plot, the gameplay, the dialogue, the online mode - its all blissful. this is one that will continue to get hours from me for a long time into the future, just like red dead redemption did, and all other past gta games. if youre having a problem with the game, i guarantee you that there is a solution out there. look before you leave a negative review! be thankful, pc gamers, because we have received something of exceeding rare quality - a game that plays and feels like it was built just for pc in spite of being a port from the consoles.",23.0

"launcher problem - solved! i had problem with launcher (crash just after log in to social) ive just reinstal my win7 and left much more space for instalation (90gb before, 300 gb now)now game working perfectly! the problem was i think that before when i left 90 gb for instalation i just forget that gtav instal will weigh 60gb but complytly i did not think that game after downloads must unpack and instal and download another paches when ive seen few erroers and monits about no enough space on your disc so i think you have to leave minimum 130 gbor even more. after instalation game weigh 60 gb . enjoy !!! dla wszystkich ktrzy maj problem z launcherem ktry wywala do windy,zaraz po zalogowaniu do social club, crashowa itp, itd , mi pomoga reinstalacja systemu i ponowne zassanie gry z ta tylko rnica e zrobiem zamiast 90 gb wolnego miejsca na dysku a 300 bo podczas instalacji wyskakiway mi bedy o braku miejsca na dysku itd. gra teraz chodzi a mio. pzdr.",13.9
"just perfect in every way! 10/10",58.0
"i started building a new pc back in 2012. it was for this game. i had previously had a nvidia 9800gt 1gb card that had lasted me for ages...but i couldnt play gta4 on max graphics. :( the new computer was going to be buily exclusively to play gta 5 on ultra settings and anything else for that matter...but that was also a long time ago. its funny how 3 years later, 2 generations of intel processors, 2 generations of video cards, ultrahd/4k resolution monitors and ddr4 memory to name a few have come out since 2012 yet my x79 i7 3930k oc 4.2@ghz titan slix2 16gb ram setup was built. i can proudly announce that i can max it out on 2560x1440 and even tho it cant hold a constant 60 fps...its awesome beyond belief. there is nothing more beautiful than the sun glaring through early morning city fog, with the silloutes of trees flickering in your eye as your looking for somewhere open at 6am to hold up! the only thing i dislike about it would be that...ummm...naah i got nothin, other than the fact it had a few issues with the benchmark which has been quickly resolved by rockstar...this games perfect! ill conclude that yes i would recommend this game, hell, id glady annoy the  out of my mates to get it if i so have to do so haha.",90.9
"60 fps gta is so much better than 30 fps console. single player is fun and online is even better. joining sessions doesnt take 5 minutes like console. windowed fullscreen is buggy for fps so have to play on fullscreen to ghet max settings for my rig.",13.1
"successful launch is successful! what are you still waiting for! buy this game!",53.0
"gta v is a game that we have waited two years for to be ported and was it worth it? i can tell you hell yes with the additional graphics improvements made to the game along with the 60 frames the game feels a lot more smoother and richer visually essentially they have taken their time with this port and if you was to ask me would i buy it again i would say yes, yes and yes. along with the improvements being made to the games visuals we also have the online where 30 players can be on the same server including two spectators. you will also be able to import your character from the previous versions of gta rather inferior versions of gta into the pc port. personally with the time i have spent on it so far it feels and looks like a different game with me having played the 360, xbox one and now pc versions of the game. and if you are contemplating on whether you should get this game then i would strongly recommend that you do as you will not regret it at all. finally in terms of hardware requirements i feel that rockstar have done what most publishers havent. they have considered everyone who cannot afford a high end system and with that in mind their minimum specifications are not very demanding the only demanding aspect of this game will be its 4k resolutions. and the game is generally one of the best ports that i have ever played on pc.",52.7
"gta v is finally on the pc and many people are loving it. and so am i, if you bearly meet the requirements for this game, its going to lag at some points of the game, esspically in first person mode, if your driving super high speed, most likely your going to hit a texture popped tree that you didnt see 10 feet away until the last second. this reminds me of the good ol days in gta iv. now i dont need to say much on how great this game is because everyone already knows. the only problem i have with it is the fact i cant connect to online mode for some reason, could be a day one glitch or the servers coughing a lung, but hopefully they have it fixed soon, after all, its the main reason why i got gta v",33.3
"excellent port! after gta iv, i was concerned this port would be rubbish as well. so far, gameplay has been buttery smooth with no hiccups. i get 60 fps with little to no drops at high settings at 2560x1080. loading times to get into game are loooong, but with an ssd that time would probably be decreased. i havent had any issues at all logging onto gta online at all. my specs for reference: i5-4690k @ 4.4ghz, 2x gtx 770s @ 1200 mhz, 16gb ram, windows 8.1 pro, and game is running off of wd black 7200 rpm hdd.",19.2

"rockstar really hit the mark with this release. we all know its a good game from the previous releases but the performance and optomization are excellent from the pc release. game runs like butter with every setting maxed on a 770 4gb. thats pretty damn impressive for a game that looks this good. what surprised me more is that online worked (nearly) flawlessly from the moment of release. as soon as the game onlocked myself and 6 friends jumped on and played for several hours with zero connectivety problems. there was an issue of traffic spawning inside of eachother and making the game lag a little bit it was minor and we only encountered it a few times. 9/10 release. would recommend.",111.9

"one of the greates games ever made. played it for the first time today. 10/10!",16.7
"a game that will no doubt provide incredibly memorable experiences from trying for an hour to get a sailboat over a bridge with a cargo bob to get it out of a lake only to find theres a second bridge down the line, to going through hell to steal a motorcycle from the lost but then finding out you cant keep their version of that motorcylce, to spending hours driving back and forth to get a car you want to spawn then seeing it all the damn time after you finally have it. despite the uncountable moments of blind rage this game has given me, its truly an amazing game with something to offer for everyone, so get it dammit!",39.4
"im running this game on an asus g751 laptop with a 970m with a mix of very high/high settings and it looks and runs great! for me, at the time of this review, windows borderless does seem to cause jitter so keep that in mind if you want to use that setting.",29.5
"one of the best ports. initially i had some freeze-up issues that were fixed with a simple restart. ever since then, its been running like a dream at high-very high settings. specs amd fx6350 (about what you need to have an enjoyable experience) nvidia gtx 660 (runs everything at 30-60 fps at 1920 with aa off) 8gb 1600mhz ram (if the game starts to get choppy, clear your ram/restart computer) 7200 rpm hdd (the game uses some streaming data so make sure its on a decent hard drive ie not an external one) 10/10 port. not only does it run well, they gave us many features from the start that the peasents didnt get. also, the first person mode is awesome, i was very surprised at this. 7/10 story. trevor knocks off three points.  killed jonny 10/10 gameplay. gunplay is somewhere between max payne 3 and gta iv. lots of extra things to do. driving feels better than iv. 9/10 game.",68.1

"10/10 lots of fun",66.7
"definetly much better then watch_dogs. this atmosphere of 90-s aka max payne with snow and old police cars in the pro-logue made me to decide that this game is going to be exciting. already recommending as its a very interesting title",3.6
"all these negative reviews are people complaining that they cant run the highest settings on their laptop or some  with social club. man it really doesnt take a genius to figure either of these things out. it runs fine on my computer. social club works fine. its a huge open world so i didnt expect to be able to handle the absolute highest settings but the game still looks phenomenal without them. and its the most fun ive in a gta game to this day. my only complaint is the first person fov but someones already made a mod for that.",82.5

"first pc impression : the game is solid its great i wish i had a better computer to experience online and everything else but other then that it runs as expected but even better :d",5.9
"aside from the mouse sensitivity being tied to the framerate (makes the 1st person view seem awkward and unnatural), which i assume will eventually be patched, it is a really solid port. i experienced no issues whatsoever getting the game to launch or run, and despite my low playing time as of this writing (~5 hours), no crashes. i7-4790k @ 4 ghz/gtx 970 on very high settings / high shadows / no msaa gets me ~70-90 fps @ 1080p with occasional dips into the 50s during high intensity action. online character transfer from ps3 worked on launch day except i had to go to the barber and change my eyebrows and remove lipstick; and i retained my vehicles as well. the bad: 100% sp progress did not transfer :-/",14.4
"so worth the wait, the game is really great!",34.7
"its gta 5 on pc. 60 glorious frames per second.",35.8
"awesome game, worth the 2 yr wait.",33.2
"a fairly good port for a fantastic game. first of all, i know everyone in the master race with a  pc is going to thumb this down because it didnt work on their rig. congratulations, r* will give even less of a damn and will either not port their game to pc or do a terrible job. this port is actually decent, it just needs some more polish. port wise theres alot of graphics options to tweak and balance out. sadly there still needs to be some more work done here as shadows, msaa and grass totally kill performance. grass on high is fields of lush green grass, grass on normal is the same as grass being turned off... really? no middle ground? pc controls work well enough, controller works better as is to be expected of a 3rd person game from console. a fix that is needed is in mp when you press t and type in chat, the keys still do player actions....such as jumping out of a plane! so type well done guys, great effort while flying a plane has you jump out and fail the mission.... bravo. gta online is much more stable than the last gen and current gen console releases. yes, theres lag. this isnt tf2 on dedicated servers, think of it like an mmo. conclusion. fairly competent port, lots of effort was put into it. a really fantastic game, truly an epic and one of the best for its generation. but thumb down anyway if the game didnt work for you and you havent even played more than an hour.",67.8
"so far, its amazing, there has only been one bug fix update and i am waiting on some more to come out before i give my final opinion. i am currently experiencing big frame drops about every 20 seconds and it gets worse as i play. oh crap, the game just crashed, thats also something to remember. anyways, the game is still gta v but with better graphics and new pc only tools. i do reccomend this game as updates are coming soon to fix the bugs, one at a time.",30.8
"definetly the best gta!!!! it is like the enhanced and high definition version of san andreas. lots of things to do, excellent story mode, excellent characters.... awesome game!!!! a must have!!!!!",54.9
"its an amazing game, and there is no questioning that, rockstar has managed to both build up and cut off bits of the old crappy gtaiv and got into this game an amount of vehicles that would put to shame games that focus only on cars, they have an amazingly detailed world to the point where i dont think we will be able to meet again untill the next gta game, it doesnt matter how hard you look for things that miss in this game, from the amazingly live feeling city, to people randomly picking the phone out of their pockets, to getting it back in their pockets and getting a cig out, to dropping the cig and stepping on it, and the cig will stay on the ground and even to big trucks having time tables for the delivery they were supposed to make before you shot the driver in the face and stole his truck you monster. anyway, this game is amazing and you should totally get it, if you bought one of its 4 other releases i would reccomend waiting for it to get to $40 before buying.",47.1

"100x better than console versions. excellent game, cant stop playing. on the ps4 and ps3 i played an hour then got bored, but with the pc version theres so much more things to do and see, and everything just looks amazing. the rockstar editor is great, except it exports the videos as a .vid file, which nothing i download or use seems to play/recognize. i tried quicktime, vlc, windows media player, and a few more. 9/10",39.1
"after prelaoding it and letting it unpack went to sleep. woke up a an hout early so that i could try out the game and not have a hectic morning before leaving for work................5 hrs later me thinking  work lets keep playing. did not go to work for 2 days and put in about 20 hrs during those 2 days 2015/10 will skip work again and to be really honest this is the first gta i have played and it absolutely held my attention from the first moment i launched the game its that good. did not have any launch problems and got a sold 60 fps nealry all the time. it shows the amount of time they have put into the port with all the plethora of options available to the pc gamers.not a single crash occurred during the 43 hours of gameplay between me and my roommate (yes we are pretty cheap and share a single copy of the game xd ).and to all the detractors out there you need to understand that when a million copies are sold not all will work on day one and atleast 20 percent of the purchaser base wont be able to play it. buy this game its an absolute delight you wont regret it a single bit and it will also show that pc ports can be an absolute delight if done right (yes im talking to you ubisoft you suck and someone should wipe you out of the face of this earth) anyways to conclude buy this u wont regret it",43.8
"if you dont have this game yet, i feel bad for you. its so much fun, i cant even put it into words. i mean, sure, it does crash every once in a while, but thatll hopefully be patched soon. then again, it is really rare and its barely a problem. again, if you dont have this game yet, you are missing out on a lot. buy this game.",47.4
"soooo much attention to detail. truly beautiful. they went well above and beyond. complaints: controls while swimming and flying dont work or work strangely. cant figure out if its my mechanical keyboard or just... i dont know but its odd. complaint #2. completely freezes randomly forcing restart. ctrl+alt+del brings up nothing. alt+tab, nothing, ctrl+shift+esc, nothing. attempted win+r taskkill /f /im gta5.exe with no luck (might be a typo on my end) supposedly due to gtx 970s issue with 3.5gb memory. with all that being said still 10/10.",19.9
"in-game newscaster blame video game for violence on the rise. 10/10 would hear again.",15.2
"as for the main game, not much to say other than its pretty damn good. personally, on online, id say its more of a meh, implying you dont have alarge group of friends willing to play with you whenever, however i do enjoy seeing other peoples reactions to the spazzing garage door on the fleeca hiest.also when it comes to upgrading your personal vehicles, i dont enjoy the fact that you *have* to win x amount of races in first place to unlock anything that actually upgrades the car and itsnt purely cosmetic, not so great if youre like me and not good at racing against other people, to put it more simply, i have my money, let me use it. 8/10",80.4

"thank you console peasants for beta testing gta 5 for us. amazing on pc, 60 fps makes this way better then console and actually playable. rockstar did a amazing job optimizing this game for pc and they learned a lesson from gta iv port for pc that was horriable.",26.0
"gta 5 is an amazing game we should all know this.but the real question is if its a good port(its not realy a port but still)the answer is yes aside from a few bugs i have ran in to like the humorous line glitch for characters online to frustrating glitch were i freeze durring heists but all my concerns can be patched out so i would recommend :)",24.0
"this is the best game i ever played. if u wonder if u pc is good enough. dont worry. i have a bad pc and even i can paly it witouth problems. just buy the game and have some fun. their are a few glitches but its not that kinda deal. the most ones are already fixed. i have been driving over players. i went to the strip club. i had a glitch that a hooker was stuck in my car(not complaining about that rockstar btw) and i have so much fun playing this game! i waited 2 years now and its finaly here, just buy it :d",44.3

"great game i have own all the gta back from ps1 to 3 and xbox360 to pc. i have to say this one is the far best one they ever made and well thought out. the pc i have might blow the system requirements. i would recomand a ssd hard drive over a mechanical hard drive so you wont get the loading and make the game little shuttering while playing hardcore max graphic setting or reaching other parts of the map in game. i have a 780 gtx ti for a video card and i already maxed out on the video ram of 3gb. if you are a hardcore graphic user and want the best of the best picture and graphic quality and want the max setting. i would recomand 770 or 970 or better as above 4gb. sli help to reduce the shuttering as far screen resolution. i played on 1920x1080 on a 24 inch montior and i already maxxed out on my video ram on one card. i wanted to maxed the game out..but i couldnt becasue of the video memory. you can over ride it and play at maxx setting but it will start to used your system ram and will start to jutter or shuttering and not a smoothable playable frame rate and mouse will have a delay of moving around slowly on movments and action game play if cops get crowded or to many people and things going in the game it shutters. but if you got a 2800 and above ddr3 or ddr4 or 3200 above ddr4 system you might get little better frame rate when useing over ride of video rams. if anything like useing as virtual machine going on the back ground or something running in the back ground it start do slow down and not very playable smooth playable frame rate it shurtters around feeling like something sluggest and cant move around very good. i wish i had a black titan or something that got a bigger video ram and faster as 7.0 gbps then you are good to go. online is fun but scared already someone making auto aims already. i can tell a few players was little to good. but that is part of life right? it a cool game. here my computer intel xeon 1650 v3 at 3.6ghz 6 core ddr4 2400 ecc reg ram 64gb x99 chipset nvidia 780 gtx ti sli overclock to 954 mhz no boost and memory 1866 mhz x 4 = 7464 mhz 6tb ssd 6 x 1 tb sumsung 840 pro raid 0 1200 psu air cooled no water cooled",5.9

"many questioned if rockstar would be up to the task with this release, given how gta iv turned out. i am happy to report that rockstar nailed it. yes, there were launch day issues, but what game doesnt have those? edit: okay, lets take this a bit more seriously. if youve watched tbs port report on gta v then you already know what to expect as far as options go, so anything i say would be redundent. if you havent watched that video, go do so. gameplay wise, running on my rig (i5-4670, 8gb ddr3, r9 270x) and the settings mostly on normal/high i get 60fps 90% of the time. again, as tb said in his video there are times when the fps drops to 40 in large areas because of everything thats loading. this has yet to cause problems when on heists or jobs, so i generally ignore it. as far as controls go, usualy with this type of game ill use a controller as driving with the keyboard is often hampered by shoddy controls. thankfully that doesnt seem to be the case here, as i have no issue driving with the keyboard outside of how long the camera takes to recenter when the mouse moves, so i drive in 1st person (which is honestly kinda fun). theres a level of detail here that is really impressive to behold. get into a car in 1st person mode and hit that gas. the tac and spedo needles move. change the radio station and most will show which station youre on and sometimes what song is playing. if i have one gripe its one that ive had with games like gta for years now and thats how it handles the music. im all for all those stations and gaben knows i take full advantage when a game lets me use my own music collection in place of whatever they provide. but weve had smart phones for years now and many people use them as music players either with apps like spotify or just putting their own music on them, so why not take advantage of that? put in a small animation of the player puting on headphones and just let the phone be the radio/music player. other than that the game is a gem. being able to switch between the main game and gta online at will without needing to exit is perfect (although the load times are annoying).",68.0

"gta v is a better port than gta iv. it runs smoother despite the fact it uses newer tech. ive never played the console versions so i cant compare it to those -- though its pretty obvious that the pc version runs and looks much, much better -- however, its one of the better aaa releases of late. i recommend using a beefy cpu and gpu to fully enjoy the pc version. im running it on an i7 4470k haswell and a 770 gtx which allows me to run everything on very high except for textures that are set to high with a stable 60 fps (higher w/ v-sync disabled). you can squeeze by with an older card but youll be missing out on the full scope of graphical improvements in this release. im still playing the story mode and havent bothered with gta online yet, so i cannot comment on its functionality, but story mode is running fine. no crashes or stutters or any other game breaking issues. my only gripes seem to be in game design, and its a little petty of me, ill admit. i dont like the cops in this game, theyre too invasive and it feels like a lot of the chases are more tiresome than exciting. losing the cops in this isnt as fun as in previous titles. also, it feels like they pick up on every little crime you commit and thats a bit of a change from the other games. unrelated but just as annoying, the phone in this one is absolute trash unlike the one in gta iv. gta ivs phone was quick and intuitive. whereas in gta v, im annoyed with how much time i spend trying to find different things in my phone when im busy driving or doing a mission. it seems like theyre just too busy satirizing apples iphone when they should have made a functional phone for us to use. perhaps i shall adjust. so thats all. concluding, id like to just say that rockstar has improved so much in this latest release. it seems like they have learned from gta iv and listened to their fans quite a lot when it comes to developing a port for pc. aside from that, the gameplay & story remains pretty flawless and loyal to the gta-feel that were accustomed to, with the exception of annoyingly clairvoyant police and a couple of petty gripes of my own. still, its definitely a better port and worth giving a go.",67.8
"maybe the best computer game ever made, for any system. you certainly could argue it. ive played all the gtas, each one right at release and again and again repeatedly over the years, and ive been a huge fan since the very first top down gta way back when, and this is still the best gta ever. its so good its almost literally unbelievable. the pc port is clearly the best version of v, with an almost surreal amount of refinement, graphics options, control tweaks, full surround/eyefinity support that even includes hud movement to prevent bezel interference, and the much lauded and stunningly amazing first person mode. the open world is alive and constantly in motion, the game is absolutely beautiful, the dialog is sharp and accurate, and the amount of content is gigantic bordering on ridiculous. the minigames are better than, or at least very comparable to, the full game titles that inspired them, and theres so many! the game does require a very powerful system to appreciate fully, but since when is that a negative? im extremely pleased that rockstar pushed the envelope of what was possible, because the results speak for themselves. with the review system (specs below) i get steady 30fps through most every type of scene and location in the game, and thats with everything maxed out and vsync on, except for fxaa instead of msaa, and no reflection msaa. everything else totally maxed out and still 30fps @ 6040x1080. i think that at least merits a o_0, dont you? its not a bad port at all, its just got very high hardware requirements and people expect too much out of their old rigs. ive only played the game 13 hours so far (a drop in the bucket considering how endless the game is) but the adventures ive had already were so insane and numerous that i can barely recount them all. spontaneous burt reynolds two wheeled flat spinning pistol blazing police chases. rush hour fender benders that resulted in multiple (hilarious) vehicular manslaughters. moody train rides across the countryside. fistfights with angry winos. giving anyone and everyone the finger. the first jewely store heist that by itself makes payday 2 look like an insulting pile of crap. and these are just the first few bites of a massive, 27 course, impeccably prepared banquet of video gaming destruction. so many developers getting lazy and greedy these days, but like elzar the neptunian master chef, rockstar keep kicking it up another notch. bam! best 60 bucks ive ever spent on entertainment. i will play this masterpiece 300 hours or more... by next weekend. truly goty, and one of the best video games of all time. for once, you can believe the hype. review system: i2500k @ 4ghz, asus strix gtx 980 @ 6040x1080 bezel corrected, 16gb ddr3 1600, intel 730 ssd, htomega striker 7.1, win7 x64",48.1

"grand theft auto v is a meticulously crafted open-world sandbox title by rockstar games. the constant delays and hype of the pc version was laid to rest when it finally saw its release on the 14th of april. as for the review, i shall be brief so as to be as less time consuming as possible. gta v offers vibrant visuals, a modern yet enjoyable plot consisting of a mixture of reality and satire. it also offers replayability due to its vast counterpart; gta online and a living, breathing environment in the streets of los santos and blaine county. aside from the main plot, the game maintains its entertainment standard by offering its players with a variety of tasks, missions, random quests and activities. pc users that may not be as up to date can also try this as the game itself is optimized in a way to deliver utmost performance while maintaining its graphical fidelity. i must say, this is pretty much the only aaa game that deserves a praise in the recent scenario as minimal bugs have been found and those discovered are being eliminated by rockstar. as said before, ive been brief - very brief in fact. it doesnt matter as to what kind of games you like. this is a must buy and shall remain one for years to come. 10/10 indeed.",76.0

"edit: stutter lag returns when loading large/new areas or opening doors to stores. altering any model/environment causes huge freeze lag. for example, i run at perfect fps, punch someone with a hat, and then freeze for 3 seconds while the game calculates how to handle separating the hat from the avatar. gg. opening doors in stores, i see black voids where the environment has not loaded in yet and then the game freezes. i swerve into a gas station to dodge someone trying to run into me into a gas station. game freezes for 3 seconds to calculate making the gas station explode to kill me. gg. games still as boring as ever as free roam player vs player kill on sight and mini games. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- opinion heavily influenced by poor optimization issues causing clunky input delay and fps lag after several minutes of gameplay (fps is perfect when game is first started). this machine is just above recommended specs based on can you run it. people with only minimum requirements met should not consider this game. stutter lag problems. lots of people have them. you can google it or youtube it and see how much of a headache youll have. have to jump through hoops to maybe work for you. not actually much to do online unless youre messing with your friends or other people. but then again, ive been spending most of my time trying to fix the fps stuttering. working to try to fix it for myself, but recommended specs (according to can you run it) resulted in crappy performance...so be wary. at this point cannot recommend, might change the review if any fix actually works. edit: stutter lag problems fixed by adding gta launcher, gta executable to nvidia control panel and following some guide online to reduce usage of the launcher and maximizing usage for gta executable through that control panel. also deleted process wmpnetworksvc since gta 5 supports custom music; (wmp might be expanded out as windows media player) may be named slightly differently like mine was. also run gta from a batch file from a guide on fixing gta 5 pc stuttering fixes on youtube. it reduces priorities on other rockstar applications that launch and maximizes priority on gta game itself. all of these had slight improvements to performance until it was fixed. now runs at steady fps at full speed in a car, plane, and boat. i did not have nvstreamsvc that some ppl had stutter lag from. edit: this is my first experience with the gta series and the game type in general. joining a gametype outside of free roam more than halves steady fps. dont see the attraction with a lot of mini games and free roam killing outside of messing with other people or playing with friends. unless grinding stats and money gta is your thing... almost no anonymous player to player interaction other than killing each other on sight and grinding missions in complete silence. the best part about the game are the funny moments when the game glitches or someone does some dumb stuff with their characters. id rather watch funny youtube videos of this game rather than play it myself. edit: heavy steady fps drop after several minutes to an hour of gameplay and stutter lag starts returning though never as bad as before i made tweaks (unplayable then). i bought into the hype. you should only get this game if you like these types of games. definitely not guaranteed to be fun for more hours than any other decent game on steam espcially if youre playing this without friends. pros: -games funny. <--- main point of everyones 1-line reviews. -havent met anyone using illegal programs to enhance their gameplay. cons: -not optimized for many systems. -may require you to spend several hours outside of game to fix issues (such as stuttering). -gta 5 online is composed of only mini games and free roam killing. -free roam doesnt reward you with anything at all compared to the missions and mini games. -no decent anonymous player to player interaction --+players play in silence during mini games to grind exp and money. --+people always kill each other on sight as far as ive seen as the only other player interaction. -character clothing customization is very limited. --+same/similar model shirts/pants/shoes, different colors/picture designs to create the illusion of high variety of customization. -no weapon customization aside from making clip size bigger and slapping on a silencer for the most part. -sometimes get placed into empty lobbies when there are private lobbies available if we want to play with only friends causing people to go through at least 2 long loading screens to find a populated lobby (not guaranteed to be placed into a populated one when choosing to search for another lobby). -long loading times are long when going back into free roam. -the funny moments are rare and very short lived. -overhyped and let down by whats available and the way the player interaction is set up. -costs 60 dollars. -games too similar to the free failed game apb online (without the cheaters). will only give this game another try if i see any attempts at fixing these poor optimization issues. or if a friend wants to play. havent been this bored in a hyped game since divinity: original sin.",8.3

"had fun with what little i was able to play the online mode. not going to recommend this game due to its poor support and time wasted by me troubleshooting unknown errors that did not lead to being able to play this game. downloaded the game, was fast 59gigs~. 1 to 1-1/2 hrs tops installed and started the game. no issues at first through the story requirement portion. once i obtained access to online play, the entire game has gone belly up. upon starting the game: 14x its not made it past the loading screens, 10x its crashed mid game, 18x its crashed randomly. ive tried everything from rechecking my drivers are current, automatically manage paging file size adjustment, dx10/dx10.1 toggling msaa, setting all gfx settings to the very lowest, r* create a second user profile with basic characters, restarts, and closing the launcher once the game is open. i run a i3 4630 3.6ghz, 8gb ram, r9 270x... which are all above the mark for running this game. i suggest steering clear overall due to r* poor release of this game.",12.8
"honestly, i was so excited at first when the pre-order for gta v went up, i purchased it in a heartbeat. and i jumped on as soon as i could to get it. the campaign is kind of glitchy, and online is absolute . i cant even get past the tutorial without my computer crashing. how long has it been since it came out for xbox? a year and a half? i would have rather waited longer for a game that actually works than what ive gotten now. if youre thinking of buying it, wait for the fixes first.",2.0

"review for gta v online from programmer and game designer perspective. - gta v online feels just as crappy as a singleplayer with simple networking slapped on top of it. nothing technically amazing with a sloppy game design. - loading screen and lobby waiting problems are much worse than in left4dead2. - your are forced to connect to open world and spawn in it every time you want to join a lobby, what takes a lot of time. - there is no open world, but only separate world instances with only up to 32 players. - bad community. everybody loves steamrolling noobs who dont know about enter passive mode button. why it isnt enabled by default for new players ? - learning curve, you will need somebody to hold your hand when you just start playing. - barely achieves high fps and playable game smoothness on notebooks with gt 750m videocard. verdict: kinda nice game to play when youve got nothing else to do. but i do not recommend playing it online alone without friends. if you are buying it just for online features - its not worth the money.",7.8
"worth every cent of those cs skins ive sold for it! :)) i really really love this game, basically you can do anything, even going to the  ladys  :)) like in real life, you just need money! online is awesome also! i can play counter strike if i want ... or i can race and feel like playing nfs ! :) what else do you want from a game ? + a cool story line .... definetly would buy it again and again! 100/10 :d thanks rockstar! best game this year :)",36.0

"the game overall is good but my game stutters like crazy. the 1.01 patch was supposed to fix this, but only made it worse and entirely unplayable as of 4/20/2015. this is unacceptable from rockstar since alot of people have been having this issue. there is no fix for the stuttering as of yet. gtav uses alot of cpu and ram for some reason. rockstar support hasnt responded when i put my problem in on the 15th of april. this issue isnt due to my system due to the fact that i get more than 70fps when i dont stutter. ive tried running at the lowest setting, but it changes nothing. rockstar needs to fix the bugs that this game causes for people, it is just unaccpetable.",51.2
"this game has serious potential, but it was deliberately  upon by rockstar. the quality of the port is mostly good, unlike gta iv, but unfortunately thats all they did right. rockstar intentionally made online mode a grind-fest that rivals some of the worst mmos. they intentionally bottlenecked your income so that you would buy in-game currency from the rockstar store. for most players, if you do not buy in-game currency, you will never obtain even 10% of what is offered online. so essentially i paid 60 dollars to experience 10% of online mode. at this point they expect you to pay extra money to experience the remaning 90%. many of the vehicles are overpowered as well, and inaccessible unless you play the game everyday like a job, or cave in and pay money to rockstar. that is unacceptable. pay2win is something you expect from garbage-tier free-to-play games, not a 60 dollar aaa title. one of the cars is even bullet-proof, and you can shoot out of it! it makes zero sense, players can actually shoot through the armor-plating while remaining invulnerable to bullets. this means you have to spend even more money on explosives to take them out. now heres the kicker. you spent ~1500 for one sticky bomb, and assuming you land it on their car during a fight, you have to pay 7 grand to reimburse the player for their car! so if some  is driving up to you and shooting you in free-roam for no reason, you have to pay extra money to dispose of them, and it costs them nothing. this is a ing joke. if you absolutely must buy this game because you want to experience single player, which is the only good part of the game, wait for a sale. also, do not spend money on the micro transactions and reward rockstar for their . gaming is being ruined because gamers support this kind of . i regret buying the game for sure, live and learn i guess.",55.6
"i really love how i dropped sixty dollars on this game and downloaded the whole 59 gigabytes for days and at the end of the day when i launch this game i have to log in to the ing rockstar social club. yes thats right, you drop cash on this and the entire game is stored locally on your disk and you need to get an authentication from rockstar to launch it. no offline mode. there isnt even a hash of your last log in which would serve as authentication. great game but this ubsurdity ruins it.",8.9

"i do not recommend this game for mulitiple reasons that i have experienced. the first problem that i had to deal with was the game kept crashing before i even got in, but after looking on youtube for help i solved the problem. so i get to the game and play single player. first mission runs smooth for 5 min then goes to al hell. the lag was real. i decided  hey why not try online. i have a friend who also got this game. turns out you cant play with friends unless you use you social club account to find them. joining their game throught steam just sends you both to random servers. so we finally got into the online game and it hit me like a train full of rhinos. there was nothing to do! there are tons of boring tedious tasks or you could buy a house and watch fake t.v. (the anime show was.... interesting) you can drive around and kill civilians but, there is little to make your own fun with. there are enviroment related things to do, the only fun mission like things are the heists. which you need a group of friend s all together at the same time to enjoy. in conclusion unless the bugs are fixed and the content is updated then i would not buy. thank you for reading my thought and remember that these are my opinions.",12.7

"a solid port, not much better than console version but run smoothly ... as long as you dont mind rockstars ing social club. nothing more exhilarating than twisting your thumbs while staring at the loading screen for hours since the game cant load past scs authen check. on gameplay: single is ok, as expected of a gta game. multi is okayish but somewhat misleading. the famous open world gta is known for is no more than a glorified lobby, every match brings you to a separate match instance. nothing new since the game is already 2 years old but if you are like me who didnt bother reading up on the game before purchasing, its something to reconsider. tl;dr: tic tin th ng mua, crack m i cho c vic. update: third day in, and the game still refuses to load past the initial loading screen. this pile of shiet is officially the worst purchase in my collection after rome ii total war. if you can, dont buy it, but pirate it. a port is still a ing port.",5.6

"ehh, its ok... the work theyve done is great and is easily worth the game cost alone. however, craftsmanship aside, this is a bit better than gta4 technically speaking, but not better than gta3: san andreas immersion/story-wise. - its a bit of a cheap gimic for game makers to let users create their own content (movie mode). that was a novel idea back when minecraft came out... now its just lazy. - the missions feel cobbled together and the character switching requirement/feature causes immersion loss. - main characters are as deep as a kiddy pool, and supporting characters are mostly just annoying and not lovable. + trevor, however, was really well done! + graphics, controls, cars, city, diversity, engine, optimization are all cinima grade awesome. all in all, its fun to screw around gta2 style, but at $260-ish million development budget... they could have done considerably better. rockstar, if youre listening and think i should shut up or put up... deal... ill help you build gta6 :)",59.9

"+ graphic could actually be better, but still all over the place, considering that the world is so big + realistic characters: they are not normal persons for sure, but it never feels like rockstar is forcing the characters to develop their behaviour + very interesting stories which are very well integrated into the gameplay and the environment: during the missions the player has to interact with the world a lot, but i never feels much scripted like in other games; also the gameplay has a lot of variety + a smoothly and naturally acting world that takes place at the east coast of the usa + great humour: although the game can be quiet brutal or radical at some point (-see trevors behaviour ^^ ), it actually made me laugh a lot of times and surprised me with creative ideas for missions etc. + a lot of radio stations presenting nearly all kind of music directions + a lot of things to do apart the missions: even just the tennis mini game is better than some other games out there ^^ + revised wanted system: the police and the whole system now work better, although you could also argument that the car chases now take too long and that the police shoots too good, but even then i still find the new system better than in older gtas + new skills and such for your character: basically you can have some sort of bullet time for shooting but also for driving - last thing makes driving so much easier for people like me who shoot better than they drive ^^ + more content such as cloths, cars etc. than ever before + way friendlier placed save points + a lot of settings to modify the controls etc. - however i would like to have the older weapon circle system, the new one seems to be not that optimal for pc",8.4

"graphically? honestly i dont think it is much better than gtaiv with ice-enhance mods. i played it with minimum settings and besides a lot of jaggies from no aa it looked really good. i cranked up my gtx680 and tuned it for about an hour and honestly i didnt see a huge difference than stock minimal settings. its really apparent that a lot of the detail was put into the textures. not so much shaders. which is really obvious by the amount of v-ram textures take and how little ultra shaders take. newer game newer hardware where is the oomph? compared to gtaiv with ice-enhance shaders? its just the texture detail. weve seen this level of detail already in gtaiv. the dx11 feature set along with nvidia specific features offer a lot for a developer to play with. tesselation is one of the coolest things that dx11 offers. yet it is near non existent in gtav. you can turn it on but i have yet to find where it is being used properly. shaders are neat and can offer a graphical wizardry that 3d modeling cant. a great example is in valves left 4 dead 2 in the swamp map where the water is pooling and reflecting while on fire. its a really cleaver piece of code to create this effect that couldnt be done any other way. i think the explosions in this game are pretty lack luster for me. very few particles came out of a tanker truck i crash into in the benchmark test. they live and die unrealistically and have the trajectory of a firework not a tanker truck explosion. i am glad i was able to play for 9 hours before my game keeps freezing at an exact point leaving me stuck in the story and not able to move forward. but i am not looking forward to the weeks of tech support email i now have to endure. this is really typical of rockstar for anyone that has been playing their pc games for the last decade or so. if you are one of the millions that cannot play a game you have been waiting almost 2 years to play you know the grief. rockstar games have great character and story. yet they really lack in the technical department. they are always buggy ports of console games. i wish for once they would start with 3 separate codebases (xbox, ps3, pc)and hire good programmers. theyve had 2 years to do this? whats the excuse? we could go one by one and talk about all the shaders and i really dont see anything here that wasnt as good if not better in ice-enhance mod. in their defense i will add that the anisotropy of the cars is very good. it always feels metallic as it should. good job using shaderlab guys?",73.6

"oh my god, it was worth the wait! ill admit to being a gta fanboy (played almost all since gta 1) but for good reason. in my mind, this is by far the best sandbox game in the world! it combines so many different kinds of games (shooting, driving, flying, exploring, sports, rpg etc) but it combines them seemlessly, so seemlessly that it doesnt seem strange to be shooting helicopters out of the sky at one moment, then five minutes later find yourself playing tennis! the plot is amazing, the humour hilarious (though i do have a bit of a sick sense of humour myself, so maybe thats not something to recommend!) and the action fast-paced. i upgraded my computer in advance of this game (got a gtx 960 g1 2gb) so i was able to play with maximum detail, fps and resolution, and oh my giddy aunt does it look good! i want to invite all my friends over to show off how good it looks, but then it would mean stopping the game to open the door and let them in (and thats not a sacrifice im prepared to make yet.) i havent played the online version yet, but i played a lot of mta back in the day (if you havent heard of multi theft auto then google it now and see what you missed out on!) so i have both high hopes and expectations. however, if the single player is anything to go by, i will not be disappointed. in short, this is a game you must own. if the $60 price tag is too much, wait until a flash sale and get it then. just get it!",99.0

"grand theft auto is the best and fastest selling game of all time. that is actual fact. this game has broken world records for a reason. those parts aside let me give you my experience with the game. i played the original gta v on xbox 360 the day it came out, and followed up playing gta online when it was released later. both games (might as well be two seperate games) are fantastic. the story mode is rich with excellent dialogue and amazing characters, you never know what you will hear next or what might happen. this is a game of satire, if satire is something you are not a fan of or hate crude and vulgur humor this game will never sit well with you. if you are okay with satire prepare for it to be cranked up to 11 as this is the biggest amount of satirical humor you can find. no one is safe from rockstars plethora of jokes and jabs. the actual game play itself is beyond solid, compared to the original gta iv made on the same engine 7 years ago, this game stands tall. the driving is a tiny bit arcady but it is much more realistic and responsive than the sluggish and oil slicked tires of gta iv driving. shooting is much more solid as well, targets snap to much more fluidly with more precise control on where you wish to aim as opposed to gta ivs snap and  dragging of the reticule back to the center of mass. flying is also solid and even much better than it has ever been before, vehicles feel like they have weight to them while flying and take realistic damage. specific parts of vehicles or aircraft can be targeted to cause precision damage, such as shooting off the rotors of helicopters or taking out the engine of a jet. speaking of flying, there is turbulence now that is reduced by your flying skill which gives incentive to level it as well as enjoy the more responsive flying style, planes can even stall if they fly straight up. customization in this game is huge, each character can wear a vast array of clothing and haircut or tattoo options and every vehicle can be customized with unique colors. compared to gta iv its laughable how drastic the difference. in gta iv you couldnt even customize cars, you could get their color changed but it would be randomized what color you got so you had to repeat the process needless and there was nothing else. thats it. gta v has options a plenty, from performance enchancing to many cosmetic changes as well as protective such as armor and bulletproof tires. overall single player for gta v is an amazing experience, and with the new first person mode, replaying the campaign and just using fpm is an entirely different experience. gta online is vast environment with so much content that i cant even cover everything i want to say about it here, if you are truly interested in gta online go check out my guide duo vandals ultimate guide to gta online on the guide section and give it a rating if you enjoyed it. ive been playing gta online to this day since 2013 and its the best online experience you can have.",74.0
"after a long much awaited delay... i cant say that im in any way dissapointed. this game is all that i would hoped it would be, it runs on lower end pcs as well as looking great on high end pcs. its a all around good purchase for everybody around the pc gaming community. i am so glad that rockstar stepped up to the plate and made this game live up to the hype aside from some early download issues which are to be expected with the amount of people hitting their servers at one time. all around i can say that this game is completely worth full price(at least for a pc only gamer) and it wont dissapoint!",24.4

"finally at last,gta v has finally come to pc,i gotta say,this is a much more improved port than gta iv,but however,i did notice some things that are not right and rockstar may need to fix them and also some things are kinda weird for me. here are some pros/cons for this port pros gta v pc port awesome 1080p support (im currently using this) graphics improved from console (at least from my eyes it is) very good optimized (with the 3.50 driver from nvidia) rockstar editor is very unique and cool (exclusive to this pc port only) looks beautiful from my monitor looking at los santos being alive mods (there are no mods out yet,but this will be one of the main reasons of why this port is so succuseful) cons some unoptimized areas (sometimes when i got to some areas such as open plain desert,my fps will drop but when i go back to city,its back to 60 fps,rockstar please fix/improve this asap and also i use a asus gtx 970 and when i set up the graphics,ive only used like around 2.0-3.3 gb of vram and also by the time i set up the graphics options,the bar was green which i think it meant it was stable and optimized but apparently it completely didnt. ) kinda weird controls for helicopter/plane (not really a bad thing,but its just feel unfamilar,i cant remember any pc games that have this controls,you use the number pad to drive forward?,im not familiar with it,but i will have to master this controls and get familiar with the controls,so not really a game breaker or will lose verdict points) so yeah,thats all at the moment,i feel playing this port,its a excellent port,possibly the best gta game port ever. well done rockstar,you earned yourself a very well made cookie for your efforts put into this port. :) final verdict 10/10 for being the best port.",27.4

"this game is amazing. the world of los santos is huge to the point that i wish they created easy fast travel spots akin to assassins creed. there is so much to do, complete with three different endings, characters you love to hate, gorgeous scenery, cars that actually handle well (unlike previous gta games), and a great storyline; and believe it or not rockstar finally broke their mold because one of the endings....well, ill let you find out. when i hear people talk about how they were turned off by gta 4 and dont think gta 5 will be any better, i ask them to reconsider. there are some big differences between the two. whereas gta 4 took itself a bit too seriously and tried to be dark and gritty, gta 5 takes a much more lighthearted approach. its much brighter; the landscape is amazing from sterile, industrial areas to gorgeous mountain peaks; the story has a much lighter tone; and the characters are much more dynamic than ol nico bellic. sure, the action sequences can get really intense, but in general gta 5 doesnt have so much drama to weigh it down. and you dont have an annoying cousin calling you every 5 minutes to go bowling. (that alone is a major improvement.) the graphics in the pc version are insanely good and highly customizable. just about every function that you can imagine can be tweaked so that you can get the perfect combination of quality and framerate. just be warned that some of the settings require a restart of the game. but when it comes to the graphics quality between the pc version and the ps3/xb360 version, there is no comparison. another big turn off to gta 4 is that driving is horrendous. it truly feels like youre driving a go-cart on an icy road even when the roads are clean and dry. rockstar fine-tuned the driving in gta 5 so that its much more responsive and significantly easier than its predecessor. (its still not as easy as in other games like saints row 3, but its a significant improvement to gta 4.) the game also allows for seamless switching between keyboard/mouse, which i prefer for gunplay scenes, and controller, which i prefer for driving and flying. if there are any negatives, i would say that the biggest is that if youre a gold medal hunter, the game gives you no clue of whats required in a mission until the mission is over, effectively forcing you into replaying the mission. some of the missions are very long and convoluted, so this seems like a really big jerk move on rockstars part. additionally, there doesnt seem to be any kind of cloud save function, at least not yet. i tried first playing this in 3d on my 3dtv and playend through a few missions. i then tried it on my main pc and, even though both are connected to rockstar social club, i had to start from the beginning. i thought that rockstar was going to implement cloud saving, but either i misread or its currently down. speaking of 3d.... if your pc is connected to a 3d tv/monitor or you dont mind red/blue anaglyph, you seriously need to play this in 3d! rockstar built stereoscopic 3d into the game! if you crank the nvidia 3d depth to max and you increase the 3d convergence in the games graphics setting -- ho. lee. s**t. and anyone with a modern nvidia card can play in red/blue anaglyph. their drivers can convert just about any direct x game on the fly. ive played it so far in both regular 3d mode on my 3dtv and in anaglyph red/blue on my main pc. the 3d mode is stellar, even in red/blue. if you have any of those crappy, paper glasses around, i recommend that you give it a try! fair warning, though: you need to go through a few steps to really get it to work properly. i can give the exact steps in the comments below if anyone wants them. i understand that gta 4 might have soured the gta franchise for a lot of people, but i urge you to give gta 5 a chance. while it has some similarities, it really is a different game in many ways, and it deserves your attention.",6.9

"i have seen many negative reviews about the game not starting properly. this personally hasnt happened to me. i would totally reccomend this game, but only if you reach almost the max requirements for playing. that is the only way to completely experience the game. i have a evga gtx 970, amd vishura 6-core, and 8 gigs of ram, and this game runs at a perfect and beautiful 60 fps on ultra graphics and half v-sync. the only time that i experience any kind of lag is in some cut senes, and it doesnt dramatically bring down the fps. here is a pros and cons list of what i have experienced from the game thus far: pros: -the games graphics are absoutly breath taking -the diolouge is excellent -the story is great -the foliage is an extreme upgrade from the ps3 and xbox 360 versions -cats and dogs -more vehicles -more weapons!! -the music also seems to be more modernized (as in music from 2014 and 2015) -the driving is smooth cons: -download takes ages (but i guess thats what youd expect from such a large game) -people have stated problems with starting the game i hope this review has been helpful. i have owned the ps3 version of the game, and i have to say that this is a major upgrade from the systems. if you have a beefy computer and a good sound system, id expect for someone to get countless hours of gameplay on this game. i totally recommend it :d :d :d",16.0

"i avoided playing or watching anything about the game on the consoles and just waited for the pc release. so happy i did. they got everything about this game right. pc port is nearly perfect. this is what a pc game should be. game of the year without question. i was annoyed when they delayed the game twice, but if this is the final result then more games should be delayed. ive had it crash twice but i have overclock sli setup so it may be my computers fault not the game. i have gtx670 sli and get over 60fps at 1600p with everything at high or very high (except textures at normal as 2gb vram is not enough, it will run with high textures, but you can see the stuttering as it constantly swaps the frame buffer from system ram). one thing i did notice is that sli scaling is not as good as it could be. one spot i tested i got 52fps with one card but only 63fps with both. i did find that turning on msaa 2x with one card killed my fps but with both cards it only took 2fps hit. what i found the best in terms of visuals and performance is to run the game at 2560*1600 and use nvidia downsampling to 1920*1200. this gives a much sharper picture with less performance hit that using 1200p and msaa. different setups may have different results. hopefully a driver update can squeeze out some more sli performance. cant say enough good things about this game though. everything that i didnt like about gtaiv is fixed and improved. some of the best writing and voice acting ive ever seen. havent tried online yet so i cant comment. like i said this is what a game should be and a game like this is why we buy high end pc and not crappy consoles. as others have said thanks for the consoles for beta testing for us. buy this game and show developers why pc is the best platform for games.",49.3

"the most dissapointing game ive ever played. wow this is ing terrible. remember when we all thought gta 4 took itself to seriously? remember when we thought its story was overblown, its gameplay was janky, its characters lackluster and its lack of fun? well rockstar has done it again. and this time, its worse. so lets start with free roam. you cant free roam. why? heres why. because the player is weak. in gta 5 the ammount of bullets it takes to blow out a cars tires is decreased, and the duribility of the cars is decreased. its also harder to obtain cars. so, if you, like me, wanted to walk out side, cap some dumb prick, steal his ride, and go on a 20 minute joyride with sirens and gunshots as your soundtrack, you cant because the cops will shoot out your tires and your car will become worthless quite fast. the cops themselves have also had a major () buff, increasing their dammage and accuracy. a cop will now be able to headshot you (and it is allways a headshot) for an instant kill from any range, at any speed, within their car. you can be doing 70 on the highway in a stollen noose van and be instantly felled by a default first responder your player is weak in terms of duribility too. you have half the health you had in gta 4, which was half that it was in gta 3... if this keeps up, by gta 6 a fart will kill us. and, as mentioned before, the cops are deadly accurate, so you can literally walk outside, steal a car, and be dead within 6 seconds. im serious. your weapons are largely useless. ammo is less plentiful, has a lower cap, is more expensive, and your guns are weaker than they used to be... so while that cop will insta kill you, youll be hosing down his cruiser with a machine gun and not score any hits. also, if you decide to go with a motorcycle, you will fall off. and once you fall off, your character takes about 2 millenia to get up. so you get zerg rushed by 60 cops and killed within 4 seconds. now for story. the story is... bad. trevor is completely unlikeable, franklin is bacically a cardboard cutout and michael, while the best of the characters, is a  sucker of the finest degree. youll play througout the entire story constantly thinking why cant i just ing shoot this guy/why cant i just ing do this job/ why cant my character do anything except swallow police . the reason is because rockstar cant ing write well. the story is a complete mess and i will not write any further about it because it makes my head hurt. ..which isnt even getting into the glitches. in short, this game can only be saved by the modding communtiy. the only way which i could ever reccomend this game is if rockstar were to seriously buff the player, put the game on sale, and provide regenerating health. then it would finally become fun. until then all i can say is nexus community, gta garage, the guys who did the sa multiplayer mod, ing someone save this , i paid 60 bucks and got nothing for it.",43.2

"i avoided playing or watching anything about the game on the consoles and just waited for the pc release. so happy i did. they got everything about this game right. pc port is nearly perfect. this is what a pc game should be. game of the year without question. i was annoyed when they delayed the game twice, but if this is the final result then more games should be delayed. ive had it crash twice but i have overclock sli setup so it may be my computers fault not the game. i have gtx670 sli and get over 60fps at 1600p with everything at high or very high (except textures at normal as 2gb vram is not enough, it will run with high textures, but you can see the stuttering as it constantly swaps the frame buffer from system ram). one thing i did notice is that sli scaling is not as good as it could be. one spot i tested i got 52fps with one card but only 63fps with both. i did find that turning on msaa 2x with one card killed my fps but with both cards it only took 2fps hit. what i found the best in terms of visuals and performance is to run the game at 2560*1600 and use nvidia downsampling to 1920*1200. this gives a much sharper picture with less performance hit that using 1200p and msaa. different setups may have different results. hopefully a driver update can squeeze out some more sli performance. cant say enough good things about this game though. everything that i didnt like about gtaiv is fixed and improved. some of the best writing and voice acting ive ever seen. havent tried online yet so i cant comment. like i said this is what a game should be and a game like this is why we buy high end pc and not crappy consoles. as others have said thanks for the consoles for beta testing for us. buy this game and show developers why pc is the best platform for games.",49.3

"first day, first (my bad...) impression soooo. to be honest... i would not call this a review. there. bye. what did i find out in the what would it be? 3 minutes? not much. driving a car with a and d? not my cup of tea. if you out in time enough you probably will find out what key combination needs to be used where. i am not into controller games and not liking this. it looks kinda cool and probably a lot of people will like it. but for me this is just a xbox or ps whatever flashy game that has weird controls (like left x arrow up lolstick left yada yada) and that translates to me guessing when there is a popup somewhere on screen telling me that... wait what letter? i was still running to find out what i needed to do.) its me. i know. im old, i know. 50 euro through the drain. you know.... if you are into these games... have fun. from my perspective i would not reccomend it. but i guess i am the oddball here. so i changed my vote to yes. second day (im a dork. i know) ive been shouting and cursing to get further in the game. i have to do everything 5 times before i understand what to do. (sooo. im not good at it.) it is however as beautiful as they say, its almost like a movie. (my wife even wanted to know what movie i was watching. that good does it look for a non-gamer. the gameplay... its still a mess and obviously geared towards the controller play. it is playable and i am convinced that i can get deeper into the game. so im in. ill keep updating my review during the gameplay.",49.9

"grand theft auto 5 is a remastered version of an insanely popular last generation title which has been built from the ground up for current generation consoles and also ground up on a separate build for pc owners. given the modding community has been enormous for the franchise since the release of open world gta 3, each release to pc in this franchise really does generate a lot of interest. in this iteration we have franklin, michael and trevor, who live in the region of los santos. though we dont get to go to liberty city or vice city, we do get a little bit of time in the state of north yankton, canada. two of the three protagonists have a big job together and generate some history prior to the events of gta 5, and this leads into the story where michael encounters his new adopted son franklin. the story is definitely the most interesting in the series, and it really does run like a dream for pc owners. the story goes for a considerable amount of time, but i played basically all the easily available missions and had it complete in less than 35 hours. there are a few bugs, and the steam forums seem flooded by technological noobs, and theres a serious issue with sli, but the game really does pay respect to the pc community for the first time from the games developer. the game features an all new angle which allows the player to connect to the protagonist a lot more, and because of the new first person mode, i found myself less obligated to go on rampages and to drive well. in fact, driving is so much easier with this new camera angle. for the first time since gta3 was released, it really does add a lot of value to the game, but its not refined like most first person shooter game development companies release - i hope this will be more apparent in the next game in the franchise. we also have a stock market, by which if you arent familiar with what you can earn by investing in which company in which time, youll miss out on much of the post-campaign content. the system itself is intriguing, educational and fun. i ended up having all three characters have about 170 million dollars thanks to the stock market, and one of my characters will be earning half a million for every week that passes, so i definitely cant complain. youre able to buy properties, visit bars, strip clubs, play sport, buy weapons, and of course, pick up hookers. the controversy has officially passed for me in that the ability to be able to access the mature content isnt really interesting anymore - even though its really important to the game. if a gamer is playing only for the mature content and violence, im willing to bet that player isnt legally old enough to play the game. i was hoping we would see smarter ai, firetruck missions, ambulance missions, and vigilante missions, and all of those features we saw in san andreas and vice city, but i was disappointed. the wanted system is easy to evade and presents no real challenge, there were no additional missions besides taxi missions, and the game is really quite easy. as with my previous points, it doesnt pack a lot of interesting content besides the main campaign and a few extras, but the game veers towards being an online focused game. i applaud this, but i dont at all consider myself a multiplayer player, though its currently one of the most popular online games in the world.i feel all these things along with proper sli support are the only things this title is missing, and its otherwise a complete version of any gta game. perhaps for the next title? having completed this game on xbox 360 and pc now, i can highly recommend this title to any adult who shares an interested in the franchise, nostalgic or not. the story is totally worth it, and the aaa pc release is beautiful and scalable to many different computer hardware configurations. its a title thats worth having in your collection. im really looking forward to gta 6, and the possibilities of playing around in an equally beautiful north yankton, liberty city or vice city.",38.2
"worth it.",22.8
"its gta v. you should already know if you want it or not. as for the pc version: looks great, runs great, has a ton of options and features. this is a great port. the usual suspects of loudmouths are having problems (this is what happens when you have 1m+ sales in a day) but if you have a modern pc with up-to-date drivers you should be fine. dont expect to be able to crank everything to max though, theres a lot of options that have a huge perf hit for a relatively minor visual improvement. be wary of ultra grass and extra high resolution shadows. you crazy people with titan x sli should be fine though :p",14.2

"the game is giant, full of content, innovation, the storyline is interesting, every mission is interesting, nothing you do feels repetitive, the game easily immerses you into its world, having 3 characters, to me, feels like rockstar covered every single point of view that you usually get from gta protagonists, franklin for the times of gta: sa, michael for every other protagonist, and trevor for those crazy rampages you used to go on for no reason, just because its fun to kill people. currently, gta: online is full of annoying bugs and is barely playable, the servers put you in with people all across the world, chinese, australian, which makes playing with them impossible due to lag, and ruins the overall experience, rockstar has a lot to fix before online becomes fun, but you can still go ahead and give it a try.",55.8
"my imo score: 10/10 why? dont have to answer romans calls anymore because he isnt in the game. seriously though here are my points: story: i havent played it yet but based on my brothers gameplay,it is really well crafted and very unpredictable except for some parts. there are also a lot of twists in the story.the inclusion of 3 protagonists was also done very good with each of their respective special abilities. cheat codes are fun too! online: i played about 99% of my time in online. the community as i expected is sos or shoot-on-sight kind of players so you dont really have a room for making friends. the real fun comes when you are playing with your friends. the jobs are actually good and make a really stable source of money.beware though,vehicles are very pricey and it will be a while until you bought your first legitimate vehicle. it will still be longer before you bought your first apartment too! although they are very expensive, they give you a safe haven from the rampaging players that shoot you down with no remorse. they also give your owned cars a safe place where other players cant blow them up and you have to call the insurance company to get it back. the most expensive ones looks something that only iron man can buy,hell, the garage already looks like a house. heists: my favourite part of online. they are cooperative missions that need good teamplay and effective communications. the succeeding heists after the first one are extremely hard without teamwork but it really feels good once you bring home the bacon. it gives you a darn lot of money especially if you are heist leader (i got 200k once). the problem is that most of the players who joins your heists are 1). noobs who cant do . 2.) people who dont know what to do. 3.) people who perform their roles poorly and 4.)just incompetent s who sit around  while you and possibly others are getting  by the police. however, when someone you know or trust gets together on one crew, you can have actually fun and it doesnt even feel that you are competing. you also burn through heists quickly and you level up fast. optimization: hell, this console port doesnt even feel like it! truly the pc master race has prevailed. the graphics looks very beautiful. the streets and cities are very lively. the effects are truly stunning. all this runs on my decent laptop with the following specifications: gtx 860m(single) intel core i7-4710hq 2.5ghz-3.4 16 gb ram. it runs around 40-60 fps on very high settings with no aa and on 1920x1080! there is a little stuttering and screen tearing but it isnt really noticeable and it is just probably my eyes getting damaged from playing gta v constitently. well, thats all i could say for this review. this review will be updated as the game also updates on pc",99.3

"what makes a good game? good graphics? good story? good gameplay? good ai? good audio? good multiplayer? the list goes on and on for what some people think defines a good game. im not here to argue and tell you that youre dumb for thinking graphics make a good game or anything else like that, im simply here to tell you how great this game is. this game is by far my most favorite game of all time. no seriously, i have played this games campaign over 30 times and thats not a joke. ive actually played it over 30 times. i started playing it on xbox 360 and fell in love with it. (thats where i played it 30+ times) i thought it had amazing graphics, great audio quality, tight gameplay and an amazing story. now that i have it on pc the 360 version looks like lego. this game is one of the most beutiful games i have ever played and the best part about this games graphics is that you dont need a $2,000 in order to play it and for it to look not just good but amazing, you dont even need a 4k moniter. this game is pretty easy to run so most of you should have no problem running it. still not convinced to buy it? how about the story? its amazing, rockstar took 3 different characters with totally different background lives and extremely different personalities and they tied them all into one story flawsly. the story is amazing, you have gun fights, you prepare for heists, you chase people in cars and the whole time its going on youre doing something that makes sense in the story. no, gta v doesnt have gangs but this game isnt about gangs as much anymore. gta v is more centered around hesit and team play but there are still gangs within the game. if you like great audio then once again this game is for you. the car noises, the characters voices, the weapon noises and everything else that makes a noise is just amazing. what about music? you like great music? i do too, this game a variety of different music and about 90% of the artist on here are pure gold. it has tracks with jay rock, kendrick lamar, queen, black flag , snoop dogg, nwa and many many more great artist. whether youre into electronic music or old school rap theres a radio station for you. the only complaint that i have is theres not a heavy metal station but the punk rock station sort of makes up for it. the ai is great too, it doesnt feel like theres only 30 different vehicles and only 10 different player models. it feels like the real world. there is so many things to see and do. now if you are dead set on playing a game just for multiplayer then this game is good for that too. you create your own character and the creation even goes as far to pick your family heritage and stuff. it has a great tutorial to start you into the multiplayer and there are so many things you can do. missions, races or just roaming around with friends or new players online. its a great set up and i highly recomend it. all in all this game is great to play alone or with friends. if you havent bought it already or if you think you should save your money stop over thinking it. simply buy this game. its a great game. i honestly doubt you could just hate it so youre not going to waste $60, youre going to put $60 to great use. ive bought this game twice and i might buy it even more. (hard copy and for friends) if i do, i wont regret it.. not one bit. for day one this game has so little bugs that its amazing. stop reading reviews and buy this game so you can write one yourself!",44.2

"the online part of the game is a joke. too often problems with lag and desync causing you to die for no reason. loading times are really bad. the flow for joining games is utterly . e.g if you try to join a friends game and it fails (e.g. full session) then it goes like this. 1. start game and load into a random online session (loading times are long so yeah..).. 2. you select the option to try to join a friends game 3. it then disconnects and unloads you from your current game(takes time) 4. it tries to join you friends game and fails. 5. it automatically rejoins the random online game from before (loading times again). 6. you can now access the menus and retry to join a friends game or whatever.. how should it work? start the game, dont load any online sessions instead show a menu give the option you join a friends game. if you are in a game and want to join a friends game, see if it is joinable before unloading the current one. its not rocket science. the heists and sidemissions lobby/invite sessions etc is a disgrace to the world of game development as well. who thought it was a good idea for matchmaking to have people spamming everyone in the sessesion with phone messages about different missions... story mode is pretty awesome and when the game works its pretty solid, but to have these online problems after such a delay... geez",35.3

"let me first put this into perspective: the game itself is extremely good and i would recommend buying this game on xbox one/360 or ps3/ps4. do not buy the pc port of this game until they do some serious patching because every single time i tried to play either story mode and gta online, the game would cause my pc to crash and go bsod. i have the latest drivers installed on my pc, my specs are more than enough to run gta v and yet every time i try to play the game, it crashes and i get a bsod message. ive tried lowering my graphic settings, running it in windowed mode, using compatability mode, running the game as an administrator, and yet it still crashes and i get the bsod. i went to rockstar to see if i could get some help, only to find out that others are experiencing the same thing, they are also having their games crash and lead to a bsod. its one thing if a game freezes and crashes but it is another thing when the game takes my whole computer down with it! this isnt just a game breaking bug, but a possible computer-breaking one! this guy, combatdurable in the rockstar comments section stated perfectly how i felt because this game is causing my entire system to crash and could possibly end up damaging my pc if i continued, so i had no other choice but to ask for a refund. my honest opinion is that you should hold off on purchasing gta v for the pc until rockstar patches all of these issues because there is seriously a problem here if gta v is causing myself and other peoples systems to crash and go bsod.",2.3

"an awesome online game thats nearly impossible to play thanks to weird issues and a very poorly thought out interface. id love to talk about how much fun this game is. not only do you have the staples of deathmatch, races and missions, but you can even relax and watch some tv with friends, play darts and pool, even play some golf. there is just so much to do that its hard to imagine getting bored. infuriated, however, is really easy to imagine. you have this amazing game waiting for you, only to constantly run into weird, impossible to fix issues. online is finicky, and does not give you any clues as to whats wrong. want to join a friend? it might not connect, but instead of telling you, itll throw you into a random server. it might tell you the servers are down even though theyre not. theres no easy way to start a job or a mission with friends, you either join someone elses job randomly or, if lucky, actually get to invite your friends. theres no easy way to get this all set up. you get to fight with this while dealing with long load and connection times, only to find out it didnt work or put you into the exact wrong game, or, even better, it throws you right back into single player without asking. on top of that, the mouse drag (even with raw input selected) issue make aiming incredibly difficult. if rockstar can fix these glaring issues, this will easily be one of the top pc games. when you can get the actual game to run, its a great experience. until then, though, get ready to spend an infuriating 45 minutes at minimum to play with your friends, and god help you if anything, and i mean anything, causes you to be disconnected from them (including, but not limited too: joining a mission that only had one slot available, being forced to join a game instead of forming your own, they load faster than you, the list goes on.) if youre planning on buying this in april, i would wait until may or at least look at patch notes.",13.7

"let me start with the harsh part. harsh, but most important. in the current state (now little over 30 hours after release), this game is far away from 60 worth. why? besides all the problems people had even to install the game (granted some people are to be blamed for their rigs, but the majority of the problems lies on rockstar) there are so many other things that should not even have been issues. want to play online with your friends? forget about it. most of the time youre in a session alone. you can try and join other sessions but 9 out of 10 times, youll just be put in a new empty session. is it a port problem? no. some times you do get into a session with other people and its great! well, right until you try to do a job with your friends. then the errors begin, friends cant join, you quit the job - aaaaand youre back in an empty session and you cannot join your friends session. does a restart of the game help? nope. ok, so you paid 60 to play this game with your friends, cause come on nobody pays that kind amount for a single player game these days anyway, granted the single player campaign is about 25-30 hours long. what else is there to do? well you can do quick jobs with complete strangers. oh and did i mention they had this online issue on xbox one as well and has had it since release and it is still not fixed? yes, that is correct. so lets us sum it up. you paid 60 for an online game that doesnt work very well online, which has the same online issues on other platforms that never got fixed? will it get fixed for pc at least? probably not. hopefully, but dont expect it. so in this current state, i advice you not to buy this. and if you do and you get frustrated about the fact, that online play doesnt really work, then i suggest you get the refund steam are offering. you know when steam starts offering refunds, then its bad - really bad! just dont buy it in current state. its a waste of your money.",67.8

"pre-tl;dr: creator mode has poor controls, gun play is lack-luster at best, no dedicated servers, no solid mod support. if youre looking for a game with a great pc experience... youre looking in the wrong damn place. with rockstar not being open with mods and a simple port over to the pc, i can personally say that this game is not worth $60. what do i mean by a simple port? first, the creator for the game, the part that allows users to create custom arenas, courses, and etc for the pre-existing game modes is still based for the controller. a majority of the controls are forcefully bound to your keyboard, so if youre looking to move a prop just a smidge up... good luck. another thing is the console feeling shooting system. no recoil. minimal spread. you can say im crying, because i am. im crying because someone can rapid fire a semi-auto rifle from a long range and easily land body shots on someone (in this situation, me) who wanted to try and take the extra half a second to aim for the head with the actual bolt action sniper rifle. tl;dr: the creator is mostly keyboard based, the gun play is lack luster... at best. now, regarding everything else thats missing from a true pc game... no sign of dedicated servers or any solid mod support. why would dedicated servers need to be a thing? for modded game types, such as different maps other than los santos, a roleplay game mode, added weapons and jets, and etc. that could be enjoyed by a fairly large group of people. the multiplayer is heavily limited to what rockstar produces for the game. modding is what makes the pc experience what it is. its something that consoles wont be able to do for a long time, if ever. rockstar does not seem to be in support of modding the game multiplayer wise, unless you want to be banned or labeled as a hacker. tl;dr: no dedicated servers, no solid modding support. you can agree with me, disagree with me, but i dont plan on playing the game much anymore unless major changes are made. so dont worry, you wont have to see my crying in game.",108.4

"grand theft failure oh boy where to start with this one..... story mode single player has an complete lack of criminal activity. story mode exists only for the story and there are almost no sandbox crimes you can commit for cash. cash is obtained by playing the missions and playing the stock market based on those results. the few sandbox crimes that do exist are so few and far between and pay so little there is really no point in doing them (6000 for a security van?). the single player system for storing cars means you dont have enough space to collect them and the few that you do collect you are likely to loose in short the single player really is only story mode outside of the main missions and a few side quests which really arnt very good you can chill your bones with yogo or golf or half a hundred other pointless activities. i can only assume r* has done this to force people to play online and removing many of the good features of online from single player is  poor development so they can make even more money from players who already paid aaa prices online while the gta online experience is a little better its still screwed up. first thing to notice is the lag and rubber banding you see form people with bad connections especially when they are hosting one of the missions/races/other instanced activities. second is that too much of the content and features are gated behind hiests and races. the fact that r* limit content in such a way to make people play them hints at the poor quality of these activities all in all the online experience is pretty poor too, tho it fixes many of the single player issues and does give a slightly more fun way to make money that the stock market it is almost all done through user hosted sessions which completely ruins the point of a gta online game i live in hope that modders will find a way with this game tho i doubt they can do whats needed to fix the mess rockstar left behind",64.3

"this port is complete  atm when it comes to online, i looked it up and it isnt just me, a lot of people keep ending up in sessions by themselves and when they get into a game full of people it only last like 10 mins before it says everyone has left even though it was really you who got disconnected, most of the time it just says stuff before im done joining like lost connection to the session and then it returns me to single player where i have to load everything all over again and try again, ive looked at rockstar reports on this and they keep saying the same damn thing about doing stuff with your ports, but everyone in the comments says it doesnt help, they are being useless right now and we really need a fix. and the  rockstar says to do to fix it, we shouldnt have to do that at all, it should be there job. im pretty dispointed since this is gamebreaking for me and a lot of other people, if this problem was fixed i would rate this 10/10, but since i can only connect and play 15% of the time i give it 2/10 i would be really greatfull if someone could help me with this issue.",29.6
"ive seen some horible launches, but this takes the cake. im actually impressed how well this crashes my system. trying to exit the game crashes computer, but forcing it to quit through task manager just asks me if i want to retry playing the game in safe mode. online character creation is, well, broken too. occasionally, the game will let me into what i think might be the main menu, but that dosent always work itself out. i dunno. overall, im really dissapointed. i wasnt expecting the game to be good at launch, but i simply wasnt prepared for this disaster. i really hope this gets fixed soon. for refrence, my computer has a x4 750k, and an xfx r9 290. edit: occasionally, i was able to actually boot into the game, however i was not able to load anything beyond the minimum settings in dx10, and it averaged 45 fps. with the new update, it refuses to load correctly, constantly jumping the landing page and always attempting to load into story mode. this just makes me sad. edit 2(4/19/2015): game now runs, but the framerate is sub-60 fps, all settings on normal at dx10.",42.4

"never have i played an open world game this linear. honestly the most missplaced money in months! they try to give you a sense of decision making but it all really boils down to the exact same thing. boring missions that makes it feel like im grinding world of warcraft quests only to get to the good part. you get the same feeling as though when youve orderd a pizza and you know the delivery will be here any second, and youre absolutly starving. youre waiting, and waiting but he never comes. still youre 100% sure he will. and before you know it the game ends. not only is the story one of the most linear stories ive played since call of duty mw3. but it is repetetive aswell. all of those who have played mobas know the feeling when youre supposed to gather 5 flowers. yes, these kind of quests sums up this game pretty well. actionwise is this game slowphased. cutscenes are continuously breaking the immersion and rockstar refuses to let you play through any events at all!!!! to give you an example of how things would be: you press w for awhile to move to a specific destination where the cutscene is programmed to start. explotion, your character runs to cover and now youll have to press w for abit longer only to get to the next cutscene. they could have done us all a favor and made a movie out of this instead so that i could have watched it for free. tossing money down the drain when excpecting a game when really, its just a movie that forces you to reach for the keyboard to continue. the main thing they can sell this game on is the characters. you follow three different characters who are very different from eachother. rockstar have obviously tried to make their personalities as interesting as possible as though youd fall in love with one of them and there by also start to like this game. i cant really come up with another explenation to why the singleplayer mode was created at all. on the upside it has alot of modding capabilities and online mode that i still see some potential in. ive been a massive geek of lsrp in samp for a long time. and when rp servers will start developing their stuff in gta v and maby even converting their entire establishments to this new clean engine id finaly see a purpose for the 50 i tossed in to this game. if youre over 18 and acctualy have experience from the era when games were good id mark this game with a big red: do not buy stamp. but, if youre a kid who just found his way to the gaming scene and finds graphics as the most important aspect of a game, then gohead, ask your parents to buy it for you.",29.4

"if youre interested in gta v only for the singleplayer, read some reviews and decide for yourself if you want to buy this game. but if youre like me and mostly interested in playing online with your friends then i have to caution you against buying this game in the state it currently is in. online is... a frustrating experience to say the least. its almost impossible to stay in the same game session as your friends, and joining the same session as your friend after youve been separated can be a sisyphean task, as the game lets you look at the map from above for a few minutes before you get told whether youre getting through or not. if it fails, you get the pleasure of spending a few more minutes loading an empty session just for yourself and then you can do the same thing over again. sometimes the game will even send you back into singleplayer without any explanation. but you dont have to be in the same session to play together, you might say. you can join a heist and then invite your friends to join, assuming it doesnt fill up before they can get in or the same connection issues that plague the rest of the online experience doesnt pop in like a drunken clown at a birthday party. if you want a game you can play together with your friends online, my suggestion to you would be to buy another game or wait until rockstar fixes the online portions of this game.",17.7

"avoid this game like a warm spot in a swimming pool please give me the self refund button so i can click it. where to begin... purchased this game for the ps3, out 60 bucks, game freezes, no fix tried two copies on 3 ps3s no help from rockstar. waited forever with anticipation for its release on pc, preordered, postponed release, waited some more... then the day finally arrived... oh joy. random crashes in single player, constant messages to reboot and reload ( if this continues contact rockstar support). once in it works fine until it decides to dump to a black screen and lock up. online.... wow what a poor design, might work for some, but not what i expected from the ads, i cross between crimecraft and apb but not as good as either in any area and those games are not great. in a nutshell the city is a lobby of sorts while you ride around and jack cars and shoot other players for no reason, or you get a call from an npc for a pve mission to do something random. or you can drive to a blue icon on the map and start a mission which for the most part are just weak pvp vs instances... at this point the game becomes a load screen simulator which i give a 10/10. early experience in these games types is that you spend more time in load screens than actually playing a match. of all that i played so far the worst was crooked cop it boiled down to 40 cop cars wrecked around a package with members of both teams spawning a block away each time they died and driving strait into the pile of cars... total cluster, the worst game mechanics in a multiplayer game i have experienced to date. on every level... come out and play really? wtf rockstar.... why? so to sum it up i have wasted a total of 120 bucks on a game that is not worth playing. i was lucky enough to get it installed so no refund for me, or i would be clicking that button. three installs of social club to fix random crashes and the inability to load the online game at all, as well as server drops where i am attempting to play load scream simlulator, yes scream, not a typo - thats what we call it, we see the fn load wheel or birds-eye city view or game tips and we scream.... so server drops, in a session with a friend, all of a sudden a spam of people leaving and i am all by myself, in a session, no friends. i have to close the game down and relaunch and wait... and wait.... only to waist more time trying to find my friend before we launch into load screens to do something stupid, then get so frustrated we quit and go do something else. could this game be fun, yes, is it, no. truth is its broken. and before you scream hater, i love the franchise i was with gta since its inception and have had every title since, but this one has issues plain and simple. i truly feel they should make the refund available to everyone. please give me the self refund button so i can click it. rockstar, today a fan has died... i am sure you do not care... but if you do, please return my money.",14.7

"not as great a game as gta san andreas, which has much better writing, mission design, wit, music, and most other things. gta v is designed more to be a make-your-own-fun game, with the story and missions being more filler-esque. that doesnt appeal to me as much as having the story be the main affair, and made to be awesome. i want to be taken on a detailed and exciting adventure, not just be given the environment for one and have it be up to me to find something interesting to do with it. minigames and free-roaming doesnt compare to scripted story-telling. gta v feels like a greatly diminished design from gta san andreas. i think that rockstar needs to shift its priorities, and not expect to get a free pass on its story quality. also with gta v, the mission design has the player criss-crossing the map every next mission in the most annoying way. in gta san andreas, available missions would develop in an area close to the player. in gta v, the player has to backtrack long distances between each mission. and the missions in gta v are bite-sized, largely delivery-type styled. theyre often pretty boring. gta san andreas missions are all kinds of different things, and theyre pretty well thought out. gta v is ok - but if someone wants exciting story and missions, gta san andreas is a superior source and i recommend gta san andreas whole-heartedly. gta v is pretty mundane in comparison.",16.0

(major problems) - impossible to get past the yacht mission (bugged no matter how many times ive tried, watch franklin die every time) - gta online is unavaliable on the first day, no idea how long it will take to come up - fps issues, 120fps on max settings in the city, 27 fps in the desert. (makes 0 sense) (minor) - graphics not what i expected on the maximum settings for pc, hopefully someone could make a hd texture mod hopefully these problems will be fixed soon, i probably will not play until next patch.

"another rock solid rockstar release .. requires social club to play, crashes almost immediately on launch .. yeap .. glad i paid for this . --- update: the launch of this game was appalling, huge amounts of different causes for crashes, and different bugs causing e.g. incredibly sluggish fps on default settings. the apparently needed mobile app still doesnt support pc a couple of days after launch. the only official answer ive heard is that if you use anything but a-z, a-z and 0-9 in your user account name they suggest you create a new user account, which is ridiculous in itself. some of the other causes for crashes have been solved by the community and e.g. on reddit you can find a decent list of suggestions. however, there still seem to be a lot of people for whom none of the suggested solutions work. i finally managed to get myself into the game, the crashes at launch seemed to have been caused by .. my microphone. disconnecting my blue yeti before launch, got the game to launch and i could reconnect it once i was in the menu without it causing the game to crash again. after managing to get into the game the gameplay turned out to be very good, much more fun than i hoped for, but still leaves room for improvement on the controls side. the controls are incredibly complicated, pretty much every key on the keyboard has some function assigned to it, and the hints for using them are briefly flashed at the top left corner the first time you need it, thus its easy to also miss it and get stuck trying to look for what key is for e.g. going into cover. while the game has a lot of promise, i cannot with good conscience recommend this to anyone until they fix their  .. this might take a month, it might never happen. ill try and remember to update this if that ever happens.",38.3

"now i am recommending this to people with pc that are built for gaming i tried this on two computers, my laptop and my gaming pc. graphics: great for gaming pcs, this has possible great graphics/textures on a great pc. sadly for user on laptop sorry but youre out of luck until rockstar wants to update the game. on my pc the map loaded fine, occasional lag for a sec to reload the map. amazing game for pc on my laptop, geez talk about bad...game occasionally crashes when trying to load(in fact crashes more than often) the map will try to reload several times while you driving/moving/looking out for your apartment. see the thing is that they made a game without a low or very low setting, maybe take away bushes, gates, certain details that just generally make it to hard for a laptop to work. gameplay (story mode): overall gameplay of story mode is great, being able to switch from characters and characters having different abilities, being able to buy cars you love and just mess around. playablity after the story, okay i guess, side missions and stuff to do afterward, still can do whatever you want after the story is finished. that is about it. gameplay (online): great, fun, challenging. gta online takes the best aspects of the story mode and puts them into multiplayer. own garages, cars, tanks, planes, weapons, etc. being able to fully customize vehicles, guns, your character. multiplayer is a struggle though inorder to keep up with certain stuff, such as rent/insurance/ammo/clothing/etc. overall as a conclusion! pc gaming computer is the best. laptop/lower end pcs is the worst!",3.6

"been waiting for this for a long time but i have to say that this time it disappointed me. despite the numerous beautiful 4k screen shots of gta v thats been released earlier, you might have gotten hyped for this game like me, but after several developemnt delays, the result is that the graphics are not even up to par with watch dogs, which has been downgraded a lot. since ive played ps4 version for awhile, it is easy for me to say that the console version looks much better. maybe i need a better graphics card or cards and a 1440p 144hz monitor rather than a single gtx 770 gpu and a cheap 1080p 60hz monitor build to fully immerse myself in this game, but this time, i only wish steam has refund policies because i cant see myself spending hours on this game getting distracted by those jagged lines and mozaic-like textures.",4.3

"atm this game is an absolute mess. let me tell you about my grand theft auto v experience. first off i bought the game originally for ps3 and let me just say the upgrade is absolutly stunning. however, the game is plauged with issues. first off all my drivers/hardware and any other software or internet related item on my computer is working just fine. its the game. so i join an online game and at first im amazed the graphics looked beautiful and i was suprised that my computer couldnt run maximum graphics options. not an issue though it still looks far superior to the ps3 version. but then, as i walk down the street everything starts exploding.... no one else is in the game and i realize the cars are spawning into eachother..... no one connected to my game and i tried finding new servers but people were getting disconnected. my brother installed the game and he couldnt even launch it untill he finally after 8 hours of troubleshooting found a fix which is ridiculous. he has to disable his drivers then start gtav and then enable them again during launch.... like wtf ? once we finally managed to get in a game together. mid gameplay it freezes and crashes to desktop.....3 times making me have to restart and join his damn game again each time! now i cant even launch the ing game!!!! it freezes on the first loading screen so great now i have to trouble shoot again thanks a whole lot for wasting my time and my money rockstar i paid $60 for this game not only for pc but on ps3 as well which had its issues believe me. so if you were to ask me dont buy this game unless you want to troubleshoot for hours! or who knows you might get lucky.....but if you ask me we shouldnt have to gamble paying $60 for a ing video game. it should just work once there is a patch yes this game will be frieking awsome! but as of now its a glitchy piece of  and im so mad that i spent a full $60 instead of waiting for this  to be fixed  you rockstar!!!!!!!",26.7

"i waited through the entire gta 5 console crash of 2013, dealing with the entire sh**hole show of online. i waited with antisipation for the pc release knowing that i would enjoy it more and save more by using it on my pc over a console. the day came today, where downloading it was crap. installing it was sh**. signing in to rockstars really nessissary social fart club to gain all my features crashed the game. having to read that they found a issue on the release day that for some reason leaves the game unplayable because of the admin name (i mean wtf how do you not notice that?) on nearly every pc, that somehow ran past every single dev at the production facility. and again having issues merging accounts because my account was locked after 2 (i mean two) attempts, and then a reset. i know for sure that at least steam has the right idea by offering a refund. i am only taking it because i dont wanna wait another 6 months for rockstar to understand their problems and fix them. i will say after another 6 months i will purchase the game again, to get the full set of features i shouldve recieved on day one. i will say not to buy the game just yet, only so rockstar can fix their peice of sh** they call the gta 5 experience. see you in six months, make a game that doesnt have such a big mistake you somehow overlooked after seeing all the money glitches on pc that can be avoided easily. maybe i will torrent the game in a few weeks to see if i should support the company who once again produced a game that failed at launched; just as much as the first time they released im suprised that they somehow skipped the near perfect release of the newer gen systems that went off far better than the older consoles. i dont want to support a company who doesnt learn from their mistakes. now for the people who actually got the game working i heard it was great. but as a service to me and the other perople who are having issues, please tell them that even though it may work, its not gaurenteed to work for all. now on the bright side, it is a posssible 60 fps and 4k game that is what the team wanted. and will include heists, as well as all the other included dlc. this makes the game good. the specs to run the game at those quality, is rather lower than what you would nomally think. i also are planning to get the game later because im building a pc that can handle it better than my current labtop that runs most games at a good balance of quality and preformance. the game if it works will not fail to impress anybody but i want to be clear of its current faults. but i cannot forget that it really states: notice: some customers are experiencing issues installing or playing gtav due to a windows user account name error. click here for details on how to workaround the issue. -wtf who doesnt notice the elefant in the room. i guess th people who built a default pc to test their game. contraz rockstar you lost a customer who was supported of this game, who waited since day one of pre-purchasing, just to produce te same mistake. fool me once shame on me, fool me twice shame on you. ill be waiting.",0.8

"overall a very solid game. tons of stuff to do, with a very large and highly detailed environment. i have nitpicks about some feature that should be added, but in its current state the game is a lot of fun. probably the most annoying bug? i can think of at the moment is that if you enter a mission with friends from a non-private online match, you wont always be put back together in the same match. sometimes you will see a few friends, but others will be thrown into a different match. hopefully r* can fix the game issues at the moment so everyone can enjoy the game (especially those who cannot launch it). my game also was one that wasnt working. i tried every fix i could possibly find, and ended up reinstalling windows. doing a clean install and installing nothing but the bare minimum to get steam, gtav, and teamspeak3 running - the game actually launched. i really hate that i had to reinstall my os, and have backups of everything (system image ftw) but this is the only game i have that i couldnt get running.",98.4

"i was so pissed when r* released the game for console and we still didnt know if it was coming to pc, or when. i have waited so long to play this game. i told myself i wouldnt pay full price because they made us pc gamers wait so long, but i ended up doing just that and you know what? it is worth every penny. what i like about it! (1) the game actually has a fairly interesting story. i find myself not skipping the cut scenes for the most part. (2) being able to switch between characters is really cool. (3) fps!! first person mode is really cool. i like being able to switch when i want (4) graphics. wow! the game looks so pretty on my 5820k/gtx980 combo. (5) smooth. the game feels so smooth at release -unlike watchdogs which is still a buggy mess. (6) the game will still provide hours of entertainment even after you finish it. conclusion. it was worth the wait. but, with all of the money they have made, they better hire some more people so that gta vi gets released on all platforms at the same time, like every other normal company does.",36.9

"rating: awesome 8/10 gta 5 as its predecessors its a high profile game, where rockstar clearly spend lots of time and money to create an ultimate gaming experience. however there is couple goods and bads that i will point out in this review and hopefully you guys can make your own mind wether the game deserves your hard worked $$$ or perhaps its better to spend it somewhere else. i will make couple references to watch dogs as comparisment where appropriate. as most of the future gta 5 pc players most likely played that game which set a really good standard in my opinion when it comes to open world games in this genre. graphics: 8/10 r* did a great job to create good visual effects. settings plate with lots of variety of options will leave you speechless. starting where you can regulate density of cars, pedestrians to even tessalation or antialaising. anything rain, snow, sunshine looks extremly real and you will be positively blown away. on the downside, even that it is a high quality decent graphics, a much better been already shown in other similar game watch dogs in my opinions which frankly require a much powerful rig to run it on high settings than gta 5. gameplay: 8/10 the gameplay is very stable and realistic. i used to play a lot watch dogs in the past, and watch dogs was a very dynamic game, where you literally could go full commando mode, very high paced combat, movements, driving, parkour skills etc. i dont have the same feeling here in gta 5. as said earlier the game is very realistic, that feels like a time slows down a bit while comparing it to wd. it still maintain the same pace as gta 4 had, so people who jumped straight from gta 4 to gta 5 will feel like at home. but as a gta fan i certainly found no issues with switching. the combat however looks very simple, i seriously think that r* could use mechanics that were present in max payne 3. but then again...who would buy mp3 then... atmosphere/story/feeling/screenplay: 7/10 i dont quite find myself well in gta 5 world. although there is a strong interaction and history between a player and ingame characters, the game lacks some kind of signature touch that were present in for example alan wake or max payne 2 (both made by remedy and mp2 with r* partnership) where actually developers created a world that was highly interactive such as stopping by a screen to watch a video, scary music played etc. i really miss that here. but i guess its me. for all others who came purely for action, robbing banks, and ranking up in crime society - it will be a heaven. music: 10/10 both in game radio stations, cutscene and ambience music and sounds are great. huge variety of genres to listen to, r* never failed here. amazing job. and of course own mp3 radio station. cant wait for frag radio plugin ;) final thoughts: as a next installment in gta generation, the game delivers the high quality game which you will enjoy for hours. i hope my review will be me helpful to you to decide wheter you should get the game. but i will say this: that game should be on your bucket list for sure.",22.9

"(tl; dr at bottom) what is there to say? its grand theft auto v... on pc. big shocker, there. what is quite a shocker is just how solid the port is compared to pretty much every other gta on pc, or many pc ports in general. its obvious rockstar wanted to get it right this time, and i think they certainly succeeded, mostly. any issues ive personally had with it so far stem from it being a new release of a game thats been polished to a near-mirror shine. things like guard barriers not opening when i approach them or my not being able to get into my carbonnizare when in first person mode. (mind you, i found this while on gta online, so it may just be an issue with gta o.) while im not excusing any overlooked glitches or issues at this rate, its liable to be fixed in due time, and the issues ive run into have never broken the game... except for... random crashing! featuring his lovely collegue quit to desktop! im not entirely sure what the issue is, but im assuming it has something to do with rockstar still working out how to account for the millions of pc builds running this thing. sometimes i can play the game for hours on end with no issues, and sometimes it just decides to break itself within thirty minutes. while the save system in the game is good enough to where ive not lost any major progress, ive had to replay a few (smaller) missions, and i expect ill be really clinching my fist during some of the really long missions. i fully expect rockstar to fix this issue, but you may want to hold off on purchasing this game for the next month or so just to make sure its more stable enough to not make you open up your task manager just to make the frozen black screen go away. ive not personally run into any install issues due to my windows user account name or anything, but you may want to do a bit of checking up on it before dropping a hefty sum on this game. as for the performance, the multitude of graphics options allow for nearly any gaming pc from the past eight years or so to run it just fine. with myself running a single gtx 980, a 3.5 ghz quad core processor, and 32 gb of ddr3 ram, im able to crank up nearly everything up to maximum, with tesselation turned down by one and antialiased reflections turned off, at north of 60 fps. unless youre running this game on anything but a $3,500+ rig built just last week, youre going to want to turn off all the advanced graphics. with my rig, you could certainly run the advanced settings comfortably, if your idea of comfort is around 50 fps under normal stress. start adding a lot of traffic, foliage and lighting, and expect it writhe about like that one guy in a plaid shirt who stepped in front of my sabre. now im not going to talk about the story too much, seeing as theres no point in reiterating what a million people have talked about before, but since this is a review, im going to give my (hopefully) short opinion about it. i dont like it as much as gta iv. there, i said it. that said, its a better game than gta iv was. it has more to do, more unique stuff to see, and the level of detail is astounding. the thing is, its important to understand where im coming from. i prefer character dramas, the oscar nominees, the more serious kind of story that gta iv has. while gta v has plenty of characters and is so layered with drama you could cut it with a knife, its the hollywood style of drama that youd find in a gangster flick. something which, by the way, is very much appropriate for the game. it takes place in a fictional los angeles counterpart, stars three gangster-types, and has you dealing with high-class gangsters. theres explosions, high-octane antics, and a whole mess of activities in-between. that said, unlike gta iv, its not so serious. yes, it has good writing and everything you expect from gta, but it doesnt have the bleeding heart that gta ivs niko bellic had. gta v is about family, but only part of it is. niko had to deal with his family nearly 24/7. something which made me personally care a lot about the characters and story. i never really cared about gta vs story outside of the multitude of situations you get into. the main difference between gta v and gta iv is the fact that gta v is the evolution of the original idea: a story-focused, open world crime sandbox with interesting characters filled with humor, parody and explosions. gta iv was a deviation from the idea, to lessen the explosions, to lessen the power you gain, to make you feel as lowly and beaten down as possible, and to force you to overcome your problems. despite gta v having everything in its favor, i still prefer its older brother. if youre like me and havent played gta v yet, be forewarned. gameplay/mission structure: im not going to talk about the heists. why? because i dont need to. theyre basically a bunch of smaller missions leading up to the long mission, a.k.a. the heist itself. what im about to say about the missions in general applies to the heists as well. compared to gta iv, gta v has a much more linear mission structuring with a focus on variety. while the variety is great, you, the player, have very little options as to how you want to take on the missions themselves. the missions in gta v are very objective-oriented. in most cases, you cant move on until someone tells you its okay to do so. sounds a lot like previous gta titles, but its how its presented. gta v is about setpieces, big setpieces. houses being destroyed, walls coming down, massive and impressive explosions. its also about menial labor, with it forcing the player to participate in an overly long dockworking mission in which you do little to nothing of actual interest and drive a number of slow-moving vehicles from point a to point b and back again two times each. this would be a great novelty if it could be done as either a small job for extra money or if you could flip the script and drop a 10-ton cargo container on a pursuing police car, but you cant. its not allowed. its against the rules. gta iv was more about the mechanics of the game than the rules of the game. it had fewer options, like being unable to raise and lower a forklift arm, (to my knowledge, anyway,) but the missions were often one objective, with the player deciding how to best complete it. if there was a change in plans, it was presented as a surprise challenge rather than simply being part of the ongoing mission. best examples of player choice are the missions liquidize the assets and flatline. in liquidize the assets, the player must blow up six or eight vans full of contraband. it doesnt say how you should do it, nor does it tell you how to approach the situation. you could stand on the other side of the street with a rifle and pick off the guards, go in head first, soak up the bullets and pray for mercy, or you could observe the buildings, climb up some airvents, take out the sniper, get some free body armor, take the rifle ammo, and start your reign of terror with little to no threat to yourself. in flatline, the player can either go roaring into the hospital, guns blazing, and get the job done, or take a look around, find a locker room, disguise themself as a doctor, and a reap the rewards with half the hassle. gta v, to my knowledge, has none of these things, not even in spirit. tl; dr: so, after all that complaining and comparing, why do i still recommend gta v? because most people loved the previous games. most people still regard gta: san andreas as one of the best games ever made. i have never cared much for the older gtas, and gta v is just more of the same, but much, much, much prettier. the pc port has a few stability issues and a few little glitches here and there, but its liable to get fixed in due time. wait a month if you think youll run into any issues. highly recommended as a great video game. i still personally prefer gta iv, but, then again, im completely insane",48.0

(still missing the rottweiler-girl i had in rl) a game that lets you have a virtual rottweiler have to be good, right? im not to fond of the switching between characters. i wouldve liked to have been michael all through. then i would probably have replayed it as trevor. (ofcourse i would have had a franklin character for the dog things too... :-) ) the switching would have worked if it wasnt for the forced switches that occurs. it just makes me feel the game is in control and im just an active spectator. so far ive been focusing on story, the few times ive actually tried hanging out with people, they say we cant. so the freeroaming during campaign doesnt work optimally. so with this in mind, why do i still love it? the area, the city, the traffic, the population. i love just driving around (whenever the game doesnt disturbe me) and explore. and best of all, the online modus seems to really rock. (except for the douchbag that shot me an hour ago :-p ) being a singleplayer guy, im constantly drawn to the online modus. racing, deathmatching and doing jobs, beside the exploring and being a complete douchbag (which obviously is an important aspect of this game :). i will recommend this game if youre into gta. this is the best one yet, and ive played them all. will i meet you online?",48.2

"certainly gta, despite being an extremely late release, the improvements to this game are pretty strong! pros: the fps feature makes a great improvement in playability and experience, for it may help players who are used to fp shooters not feel completely alienated being forced into 3rd person, and driving any vehicle from the inside delivers a nice touch of depth (working odometers in a non racing game.... wow). further more, the story for this game was great! this is to gta v as a whole (meaning pc/console); anyone who hasnt played through it already, anticipate a solid story if you plan on picking this game up. single player content is loaded. cons: more of a personal gripe, ive found myself switching between my xbox controller and mouse/keys due to control-complexity. xbox controller for anything involving a vehicle, and m/keys for in combat (whether in car on the move, or on foot). theres a lot to remember for different key functions.",43.7

"zero innovation! gta 5 ... what an awful game it is! the gameplay offers nothing new compared to former gta titles. you still cannot drive to random houses and be able to enter them. in fact you still arent able to enter most buildings. you cannot even take npcs hostage. most of the gameplay freedom in this so-called sandbox game is related to vehicles but we already know all that from former games of the series. dont expect any new gameplay in this game! a game like, for instance, skyrim offers far more freedom. when i played gta 5 i felt like my iq is decreasing by one every minute. you start the game playing this black guy and during the first parts of the game you will hear nothing but f*ck, motherf*cker, n*gger, sh*t talk. this gets annoying pretty fast! not everyone is into this childish, adolescent level of dialogue but im afraid that is what rockstar intentionally caters to. the only part that obviously has improved is the graphics. but then again, ive seen certainly better graphics in other games and the one in gta 5 doesnt warrant 60gb of game data. talking about the game data volume ... nearly 60gb ... gasp! i wonder what warrants the game needing that much data! it cant be the graphics, it cant be the audio either. what is it used for?? but my biggest complaint is the lack of gameplay innovation. looking realistically at it the game offers very few freedom. it wants to be the original crime simulator but you cannot even satisfy your inner sadist and do things like taking hostages, raiding family homes, torture victims... the game looks tame compared to what my mind can come up with. all you can do is steal cars, kill people, and cause mayhem until you have a five star wanted rating and the national guard is on your heels. but we had that all already in all the former gta games. dont expect anything new here! you will be disappointed!",9.6

"- newbie to the gta series - the only gta game i ever played was the very first one that came out in 1997 on pc. i decided to buy this one due to all the hype and the much talked about graphics improvements. i have never been this satisfied paying $59.99 for a game ive barely knew anything about - much less played. the level of detail put in this game is amazing. everything from the graphics to the story line, truly impressive. this is the type of game that you dont have to worry about completing in a day. i am looking forward to playing this game for many months. there are small issues here and there that i noticed as far as bugs in the game but i anticipate they will be fixed in the near future. if you are on the fence about this game, i definitely recommend it. as a newbie to the series, i am glad i pulled the trigger on this one. funny acting, great story line, impressive graphics, tons of missions, awesome online multiplayer and it will push your high end card(s) to the limit. 9/10",57.2

"gtav kicks off with a good story and gets into the action fast, avoiding boring introductions of controls or any of those lame tutorials. the characters this time are much more likeable than previous games in the series and the missions dont require too much repeating if you fail or die. some charcters initially have special abilities, or need to be unlocked as the game progresses. once you pass a mission you can replay it later to get a gold medal without losing your progress. the many new features add a great extra dynamic to the game, along with the need to increase your statistics through practice and excersise for required skills like driving that affect your ability to pull off jobs, heists or missions with a good completion rating and also obtain any bonus achievements. gtav looks fantastic and runs great at 1920x1080 on mid range systems or old high end systems. rockstar have truly excelled this time at producing a game with both enjoyable gameplay and engaging narrative. online multiplayer is very good and the heists are excellent. there are a few bugs in online multiplayer, but despite this the gameplay is a lot of fun and the bugs dont create frustration that ruins your fun unlike many other games. the bugs are really quite minor indeed, like sometimes your player taking a while to climb into the passenger seat of your friends car, or a little bit of lag sometimes while driving with multiplayer friends in the car. most of the time though you are just having rolicking good fun and laughing at terrified bank or jewelry store customers as you intimidate them with your gun, or lesters dorky blathering and his terrible jokes. elite completion level of heists can be quite difficult, but a gold or platinum pass is not too hard. once you get your charcters stats up you can go back and repeat missions, so some early stat boosting is a god idea with a bit of triathalon, tennis, shooting range practice, and a bunch of swimming, bike riding, parachuting or driving. there is loads of content to keep you busy with new jobs, missions and heists being introduced by rockstar all the time. plus there are plenty of objectives and side missions to keep you busy in both story and multplayer. its the type of game that can keep you busy and having fun for years, which makes it a very good investment. rockstar is getting the patches out very fast this time around. the only complaint i have is that i have not been able to launch offline story mode without the internet connected or get voice chat to work. perhaps rockstar have made sure you require an internet connection to launch gtav to prevent the large amount of piracy previous games in the series were plagued with. maybe at some latter date you will be able to play offline without internet connected, though online multplayer is excellent and adds so much more content to the game and a whole level of extra fun when playing with friends. teamspeak is a good idea to use as if you havent been able to get gtav voice chat to work (though it seems to work with teamspeak installed and enabled, requiring gtav voice chat to then be disabled to avoid double voice transmission creating an echo effect). quite a good launch, much better than most other recent multiplayer games which have been plagued by initial fun ruining bugs. sometimes loading of progress during heists gets stuck, but not before saving your progess which allows you to alt+f4 and kill gtav then launch the game again and continue from where you left off without losing your progress. overall this is one of the best games in years, both campaign wise and multiplayer. loads of great fun to be had, very good graphics when set to very high, very good stability, excellent optimisation and frame rate on mid range to high end systems. one of those games that are hard to put down and have you playing to the wee hours of the morning. i expect gtav to only get better with time as the few minor bugs are patched and more heists and content are added by rockstar and community members adept at using the editor. 4k requires more than 4gb v-ram with the settings turned up, so most people wont be able to appreciate the full splender of gtavs visuals for quite a few years yet until graphics cards with 6gb of v-ram and more are common. only the new high end graphics cards like 6gb+ titans will be able to fully max this games graphics, but splendid results can be had with even 2gb mid-high end graphics cards from a few years back. actually i dont know why im not playing gtav now its so good, so i better get back to it right this minute...",87.0

"absolutely amazing game. so far, my game of the year title. looks and plays amazingly although i highly recommend using a controller instead of the keyboard and mouse as the game is already fully set up for controllers. as far as visuals go, the game looks phenominal. with a i7-4790k and gtx 980, the game holds well above 60fps at very high settings plus all the extras. there are some random frame drops for unknown reasons and they dont always happen at the same time. my guess is that there is still some work to be done optimising this game. the biggest fail!: the worst thing about this game is the crashing. i livestream so i usually spend 5+ hours in game, and after a while, the game will crash because something with rockstar social club failed to initialize. this has happened 4 times already and when it does, it causes my graphics driver to reset and my stream crashes. extremely frustrating! you can be right in the middle of a mission and lose all progress or you could have just spent a bunch of money customizing a really nice car and it all disappears because of this stupid bloatware. worse than gfwl and uplay combined. despite the terrible crashing issue, the game is great and i highly recommend it. hopefully, sometime soon, r* will learn from the mistakes of others and strip the social club as an external software needed to run the game. otherwise, with the way it crashes the game its not better than gfwl.",50.8

"let me start by saying, you know what this is. we saw it almost 2 years ago and it was a huge suprise and brought alot of hype, but it is just being released for pc now, in 2015, i mean i had alot more hours for xbox when i played on that platform, and bringing over the knowledge i had from that platform i can say that the graphics do have a minor touch up, but other than that, in my entire time playing ive only seen one deer, that was when i unlocked trevor, and no other time. if you told me there was a couple new weapons or just one new one you would have to point them/it out for me to even notice. same with the cars, i dont even recall if i saw it or not ever while playing. and i truely feel sorry for the people who cant play, because you have to remember this is the same masterpiece that was on xbox and playstation. and thats the only reason im saying its good, its the same game practicaly just its that same amazing game that was made very well. so if graphics mean alot to you, by all means get the game because it looks very nice graphics wise, or if your just playing it for the first time. but if you own this game on a different platform save your money, because maybe after this ill see what exactly is new to pc, but because i already owned the game on xbox, and i cant tell whats new honestly.",83.1
"i saw a dog humping another dog. i switched to trevor and he immediately gets chased by police. i roadkill pedestrians and the bystanders dont mind at all. i pick up random strangers in very awkward situations. and online, i shot a random person in the head, stole his money and drove away. the game stutters when you play it for a certain amount of time and it still randomly crashes. i hope they fix these lingering issues. but if youre looking for an alternate american playground that reacts to you, then welcome to los santos!",65.7
"cool, finally its out! 10/10",48.2
"arguments are debatable about this release, because a lot of people arent able to log into the game due to crashes, steam problems, and in-game issues that are disrupting individuals gameplay. also, there are individuals playing this game without the actual requirements needed and some who have those requirements are having issues. so far, i have not passed the social club and dont know if there is an option to click to play or if the game runs after you login; its been over 5-6 hours. currently, i wouldnt by this game yet until they fix these issues or you can and just download it and wait until everything is available. in this technological era, and with all the orders they received through steam, their sites, as well as other sites, they should have been prepared, and being unprepared damages the fun and hype of the game and its community. currently, i give this game a 5/10 due to their lack of communication, and their lack in preparation. im very patient, however, so i will wait until they fix these issues. once im able to log into the game and see what is out there, i will change my opinion on it. there are other issues many individuals are reporting through the discussion boards about logins and crashes and etc.; those could be helpful to anyone who are interested in the release. regardless of these issues, i hear a lot of positive feedback about the game, which is definitely worth waiting.",20.0
"pc gamers rejoice. its is a beuty of a game. i only been playing for a few hour but the whole time it been so stable. i will recomend and most defenetly give a thumbs up to the game. just please be aware that you will defetnetly need some power to run it. so all the negative comments you will see are from people not knowing their hardware capability. i havent have the chance to see sli work either. a far as i know with a 8350 and a gtx 770 with 4 gb it does a good job, unfortanely i know my hardware and yeah.... i need an upgrade. running this with a 2560x1080 monitor i would recomend a gtx 980 minimun to max out your graphics woth most things cracked. now for 4k i recommend and r9 295x2 or titan x sli. i will let you know even then will you have some trouble maxing the game. also 2gb or vram wont cut it 4gb required, 8gb recomended and 12gb might do it, yeah this game rules it is well optimazed and uses every bit of power your pc can give. i would like to thank rock star for this amazing title and the fun with it and as for now i will be going back to play.",70.4

"first of all, the pc port was well worth the wait. the developers thought of everything; from showing how much vram is in use, to including a whole separate game mode (rockstar editor). performance is great and the graphics are stunning. overall, its just a fantastic pc port. ive been holding off gtav on the consoles because i wanted to experience this game completely fresh on the best possible platform and holy moly am i glad i did. after about 6 hours, its abundantly clear how marvelous this game is and i get to experience it at its maximum quality for the first time, w/o any spoilers or nothing. the gameplay is solid, the aesthetics are beautiful, and man, the story is phenomenal. i mean, im no real world gangster/etc kind of guy. hell, i really dislike the theme entirely and tend to avoid other games or media of the sort, but the writing in this game is just so top notch, so well thought-out, i found myself being invested in the characters and their stories. (havent touched the online yet so cant comment on that) ive barely scratched the surface of this game, but i believe ive played enough to highly recommend this game.",43.3

"definitely a good game but we all know that. i havent tried the multiplayer yet because i want to finish the singleplayer first (first time playing gta v). pc version is a very good port with good optimization and good graphics at the same time. careful of the advanced graphics options those are very demanding. with those turned off, msaa x2 and everything else on maximum settings on a gigabyte gtx 970 mini im getting 55-60 fps. i had a minor scare during install because it got stuck on 99% for a while saying busy writing to disc but that was because i had pre-loaded the game and it was decrypting so dont worry if you have the same thing it will eventually install (mine took 20-30 minutes)",55.2

"while technically a great game, i cannot recommend it to people like myself who have grown up with the series and find themselves with much less time to indulge than when they were young. i just find myself not really getting into the game as i did when i was young doing random  just isnt as satisfying anymore.",15.5
"lovely game with so much content. i played on xbox 360 for hours on end and this is no different and is worth a buy. now go! loosen your wallets! let the 60 bucks fly unto steam cards and then purchase this gamr brcaause this is pretty much the best game on steam as of right now! 10/10!",6.5
"plays amazingly best port ever! cant even call it a port. rockstar!!! thank you for taking your time with optimization and giving us pc gamers a great release. sure there are some people unable to play but this has been a much better release than final fantasy realm reborn, or say any ubisoft title. i appreciate all of your hard work this last year and some. it really shows in this pc version of the game.",20.8
"all i have to say is pc master race! 10/10 for me a good launch and ultra 60fps best ever cant belive i played this on console will never go back to console now after this thank you rockstar even with the delays better then the gta iv launch by far pre-order worth!",16.5

"oh my god im so glad its finally available. with every new release it gets better. last gen to current gen consoles and now pc. i wish i had a 4k screen to really test my graphics card. 1080p is still pretty too. keyboard controls take some getting used to. a few commands are slightly out of reach but you dont need them often enough to be a problem. supports 360/one controller out of the box and it feels just like the console control. ill probably use both to be honest. mouse/keyboard for running/shooting and controller for driving/flying. analog steering for the win. the load times are near instant for single player and the online is significantly improved compared to the console. first time i joined online, i tried to get the high priority export car only to be met with explosions and fire. 10/10 will explode again.",17.8
"actually optimized. its how watch_dogs shouldve been optimized. if you like having fun. pick up this game.",50.5
"rockstar did an amazing job with this port. while my single gtx 770 isnt running the game at full ultra, its pretty close to it. much closer than i expected, after gta iv and many of the overhyped games to come out recently. this game looks absolutely amazing. i havent played as much as i would like yet because of work, but i will be playing when i get off. gunplay is as good as ever, driving is smoother, switching characters (not that ive done it much yet) works exceptionally well, and its all bound together by one of the most beautifully rendered games ive ever seen, and certainly the best open world in terms of visuals. i havent played on console since ps2, so this is my first time playing this amazing title. if, like me, you are a true pc gamer, you will pick this game up. even if you are a cross-platform heathen using both consoles and pc, you should pick this up if you are interested in the in-game video creator. it seems like a great feature to play around with, though i will wait until ive beaten the campaign first.",52.5
"it forcess you to have rockstar account. it automatically assigns the rockstar account with the steam account. it cannot run without internet. if you ever used some dummy rockstar account with your steam account you will not be able to run the game as you can not use different account and can not access the dummy account. in other words i can no longer play rockstar games on my steam account, and all the ones i bought are unaccessible.",5.8

"loved it on 360 but this version is the definitive one. its not a perfect port in terms of small graphical bugs, social club problems some people seem to be have and it requires a lot of vram to play (even though i pushed it over the limit and didnt see much difference in framrate) and can stutter with some graphics settings when moving through dense areas. however, compared to the ps4 version, this one runs amazingly and has an abundance of customisations and settings in the menu. if you love gta, the campaign is perfect, if not, get it on sale; you may still enjoy it. multiplayer is a bit like an mmo (except theres a limit to 30 players in a server) and thats great except it feels grindy if you want lots of cash and level up. in terms of mods, its gonna be a slow burner but even though rockstar havent made the game mod-friendly, the communnity of talented modders will probably keep this game alive for a long time with impressive mods like the ones in gta iv. i would completely recommend as long as you dont hype it up in your mind to be the greatest thing ever because only some people will see it that way. 10/10 - the most rich and complete game i have ever played, any issues are nothing compared to the triumph of design and aesthetic that this game is.",44.8

"the patch and amd driver update (beta) actually made the game a lot faster and more stable (it was barely playable at first). there are some technical flaws thogh. nice visuals, quite stable fps, a-lot-of-new to explore and learn. suddenly theres something more time consuming than skyrim. i didnt try gta online yet since my internet is very unstable atm; people say its chaos and the most of the time you watch load screens, not los santos. im very happy with the singpleplayer so far. maybe the game is not totally worth the full price (i usually buy games on huge sales), but its not waste either. so, im pretty happy with the buy and i look forward for new updates/fixes. specs: msi gx70 laptop (fullhd) amd a10 5750m (2.5/3.2 ghz) radeon hd8970m 2gb gddr5 16gb ddr3 1600mhz 7200 rpm hdd win7 64 settings: 1920x1080 high texture quality high shadow quality high reflections quality softest shadows v-sync: half (30 fps) fxaa the rest is low/default. 9.5/10 (not so satisfying shooting, few other things are off, otherwise very enjoyable). 2015-04-17",19.7

"i like the gta serie but always wonder why controls must be that complicated. the story is nice and you have so much happening around you which makes it interesting to just watch what is going on. the graphic looks very good to me but even with good hardware i wouldnt set everything to ultra to get stable high fps. i keep rockstars settings when you start the game the first time, they are already very good and give me stable 100+ fps. what i dislike is the complicated way to team up with your friends, there seem to be no real group feature like in most other pc multiplayer games or i didnt find it yet. this is a must have if you want to play with friends. you should be able to create a group, invite your friends and then do missions when ever you want or drive around in the city. the way it is at the moment you have to create a session, invite your friends and as soon as you start a mission you again have to invite them before the party is full. after the mission finished you often end up in another random session and again have to invite your friends. sorry but like this it is just to complicated. another thing i hope they will add is the possibility to change the video record folder, i use an extern hdd for video editing but they force you to keep free space on your windows partition because the recorded videos are saved there and you cant change that without setting your whole windows documents folder to another hdd. you get in trouble if you use an extern hdd for documents folder since you dont always have it pluged, please change it. except those few things i am realy enjoying the game and i hope rockstar listens and change some things to make it even better.",89.2

"by all accounts a good, well optimized game. the ui, controls are fantastic. the graphic options and graphical quality is exceptional, especially for the performance i get on low-end hardware. they really put a lot of work into optimizing this and tweaking the engine to perfection. far more than any company has anything else released in years. that is, if it runs at all. theyre dragging their feet about fixing the myriad of issues which plague many players. at this time i do not recommend buying it with a 50% chance that itll just crash repeatedly, either during the intial launch of the launcher itself, or during gameplay.",52.9
"i can without a doubt say that this is my favorite game of all time. on the ps3 ive spent over 500 hours in it, and im gonna spend even more on pc when its been upgraded so much. definitely recommend this.",48.6
"after watching the positive pc port report video totalbiscuit made i figured gta v would be a great pick up, but unfortunately i ran into so many issues rightaway that i ended up requesting a refund which was still an option due to the other problems the game had. issues i had: - jerky/laggy mouse movement in the menu. changing vsync or mouse input didnt help. - settings didnt save after quitting the game and restarting - display calibration screen on every start - benchmark crashed to desktop after a 3 minute black screen - fps tied to sensitivity (not this crap again, sigh) i run a i7-4790k, 16 gb, r9 290x machine and from what i could see from my short experience, the actual framerate ingame is fine so performance seems ok otherwise. this is the first refund ive ever requested and im glad it was still an option. fully priced games, in this case even more, should always have an option for refunds to avoid these sorts of things. one thing steam could learn from origin. i hope they patch the game and fix all these issues because i am certain the underlying game is brilliant, but i just cant support it while theres so many problems before even getting to the actual playing part.",0.8
"amazing game, rockstar obviously wanted to do the best delivery of a game they could and even if they didnt, that was achieved anyway but im sure they were. amazing graphics, better than any console graphics, 60fps makes it so much better and feel like youre actually there at times when youre in the amazing... 1st person mode! which you get on ps4 and xbox one anyway but still it looks way better on the pc. director mode makes it way better aswell because you can play as so many different characters and costumed characters which is alot of fun when bored in the game. definitely recommended (if you have a graphics card of atleast radeon hd 7770) but it might look alright on a lower one, but yeah definitely recommended!",16.4
"i love this game. i have played it on ps4, but its whole differrent experience playing on pc at 60fps+. the game very well optimized. i did encounter some problems at the launch though, but i looked it up online and made a new a local account on win 8.1 and boom rock stable. if you have money to buy this game, buy it now!. you wont regret it.",51.2
"great game! played over story mode once, the game never crashed, though steam did a few times (bad bad steam)... i didnt have any problems with starting the game or any other bugs, gotta hand it to rockstar, when they delay a game, they know why theyre doing so...",118.3
"spent hours murdering an increasingly furious child online. there was a crack of thunder, a flash of lightning, the heavens opened and his bullet-riddled corpse was drenched by the fresh, cooling rain - a glorious hd rendering of his tears crossing from the real world into the game. 11/10 - would buy again just to relive that moment.",10.6
"i had high hopes, for this broken title.",11.1
"after years of waiting a gta game finally comes to pc after a very long time. the question is it good? short answer: yes long answer: when i heard that grand theft auto v was gonna come to pc, i was really happy. the console version in my opinion was good but didnt have any potential to expand, sure it will have various dlcs such as heist, the pc version in the other hand will have a lot of potential copared to consoles, for instance pc will have modding tools that will allow the community to make changes to the game, brining custom changes, for example there will be various car mods, which will make the game more realistic, but there can be other things such as funny mods where you can be superman and there will be realistic mods where you can be a police officer or a medic. another reason i have bought gta in the pc is because of its graphics, the ps4/xb1 have very limited graphics power, the pc in the other hand has a next gen change every year, heck every month. this will enable rockstar to make the game more graphically better and be more appealing towards most pc gamers and i am happy to say they have done that, they also have made the game very optimized, my pc which might not be the best in the world can run this game over 90 fps+ in high-very high setting. their is many other reasons why gta v is better in the pc. if i had to give it a rating out of 100 i would give it a 97,",38.4

"man, this game really is great. its absolutely beautiful, the story is compelling, and its bigger than ever! the only problem is that..its not optimized for pc, oddly enough. it has issues using the full power of some peoples gpu, including mine. despite being able to run the game at 40-50 fps on medium high settings, you get wierd dips, stutters, and micro sound-cut outs at times, or, your fps will randomly drop to 20 and stay there for a minute, even when youre just standing still! when they release a better version ofthe game, it will have my full support. right now, im just not feelin it.",42.1

"first of all, let me start off by saying they never should have released a game as broken as this. i cant run it for 20 minutes without blue screening, but that doesnt change my opinion of this game. it is still one of the greatest games in the franchise, and of all time in my opinion. (vice city will always beat out the others for me). for the small time i could play it, the controls were incredibly fine tuned and responsive, and the controller support is phenomenal. the game is very well optimized, especially if you have the newly released amd/nvidia drivers. the level of detail is wonderful to have, and was nice to see coming from the ps3 version. even though its currently a broken piece of , i will still reccomend it.",13.2

"finally!!! while the issues havent been fixed yet, i have figured out a way to bypass it. disable your grapics card, launch the game, and while its launching, activate your graphics card. now to the actual review: pros: - extremely large open world. - good nough gameplay. - singleplayer story is good. - good graphics. - well done car physics. - its quick and easy to switch between single- and multiplayer. just open menu, click multiplayer and join multiplayer game. few secounds later youre good to go. - rampage!!! (as to be expected from any gta game) cons: - the bug that already has been announced is a thing that really pulls down on this game. while it is possible to fix, it shouldnt be like this. yes, i know thyre fixing it but i just feel like it needs to be said as its a really annoying bug. - allthough i do like the fast switching between single- and multiplayer, the multiplayer itself isnt all thta good all the time. it isnt rare for me to see people glitching all over the place. - i feel like it hasnt been fully optimized for pc yet. - all graphics options are on high by default, this may lead to some troublesome performance in the beginning for some. this is off course possible to change before starting the game, but it isnt all that easy to know how it will run. - i have experienced 2 crashes so far (6.5 hours). i dont know why these occoured. overall i am a little disappointed but as soon as some of the bugs are fixed itll be a much better game. i know this sounded a little negative towards the game but dont get me wrong, its an amazing game! it just has some issues that needs to be fixed.",36.0
"ill be upfront. i preordered this game and downloaded it at 1.2 mb a second. its a 60 gig game. do you have any idea how long that takes to download? however, that was fine with me because i know that the game is good quality. i was so excited and took the day off to play it only to find out that it wouldnt launch. in fact steam offered me a refund the moment i tried to open the game. i was pissed. the game is 60 dollars. so i redownloaded it. now it works. as frustrated as i was i cant stay mad at whoever screwed up at rockstar because the game is just that ing good. when you see the effort, time, and craftsmanship that is put into building this game you realize that the company really is trying their best to give you the best product possible, and holy  do they deliver. the immersion from the gameplay will last for quite a long time. the writing is definately better than most games out there but there couldve been better. the female characters for example couldve been a lot more 3 dimentional the way you see on show like  californication, a game like  the last of us. that said, its still entertaining. overall id say its almost a flawless game. i dont pay $60 dollars for games ever. ever. i did pay $60 for this game and i can honestly say that im a satisfied customer. in spite of not being able to play it in the beginning i gotta say thank you rockstar.",30.8
"runs fantastic. massive improvement over gta iv in terms of graphics and performance. i have 2 gtx970s in sli with a 4770k, i just stuck all the graphics and advanced graphics settings to the absolute max and it runs. i get 45 - 120fps depending where i am and only limited due to refresh rate. the wait isnt that bad either in my opinion, i had gtav on xbox360 which was ruined just down to the fact it was like watching a slideshow. taking a break for a year from the game and all the new content r* added makes it feel all new. welcome home gtav to the best gaming platform of all time. xd side note: anyone moaning they cant launch the game, first go here",44.1

"absolutely love the series. grand theft auto v is, in my opinion, best yet. very interested in seeing what developers come up with for this game. would love to see the police incooperated a little more. maybe in ambient scenes where your driving and they are performing a traffic stop or something along those lines. also very anxious to see a zombie dlc as im sure alot of gta lovers are. one issue with the steam version of gta v i noticed. when attempting to buy a shark card using steam credit. accessing the the social club store page using the ingame interface the game locks after clicking the check out button you then experience a infinite loading screen and also freezing the characters movement if the interface is closed. all ambient enviroments continue as normal however you are not able to move. after hitting the alt+ctrl+del and killing the game process and/or ending the task a social club window pops up allowing you to use steam credit to make the ingame social club store purchase. after clicking the authorize button the transaction doesnt finalize. the game has so many different activities whether in the story mode or gta online. if not attempting 100% for the complete game completion then the game becomes more enjoyable in the closed online sessions with friends. if the player does not have that many friends that play on their pc then the online heists become very limited as the second heist that you progress to requires four players. due to the nature of the regular gta online gamer; its far and few between that you find someone friendly enough to assist you and not trying to back stab you. the online experience is then diminished even more so in public matches that will go unfortunately uncorrected due to elaborate construction of the online world. consistantly you will have to try to avoid other players in attempts not to be shot/ killed or your newly purchased and modified vehicle to be blown up or all of the above. nevertheless this is an awesome game with a very addictive story line and game play.",64.1
"i preordered this game and on release date it doesnt even ing work. i didnt want to pay this much for playing loading screen simulator.",48.2
"if you only own a keyboard/mouse combo (or plan to only use one) gta is ready to frustate you. gta loves to throw you into the deep end without prep time, wether its driving, shooting, diving or flying. flying however is the worst, with default pc controls being an unworkable nightmare that also happens to be delivered while being shot at. from my current perspective flying in gta v is about -10 of fun and there is no excuse for it. it isnt just dedicated flying titles that do it better, like world of warplanes, but also so called rivals - where one presume rockstar paid at least cursory attention to - like the saints row entries 3 and 4. they all can boast better control schemes right out of the box and that makes the poor performance of gta on this front all the sadder. im now off to see if that gamepad i bought for emergencies is any better at not hitting the virtual ground but even it is - why the hell do i need to install an entirely new input mechanism when there a several aaa title that dont need it ? steering planes on a pc isnt some new and arcane art.",45.9

"the single player is very robust and runs as smooth as silk without a hiccup. the game is a breath of fresh air compared to how grand theft auto iv ran on pc. no more gfwl and optimisation issues. the rockstar editor is also a very agreeable addition. however, the online from my experience is somewhat negligent. i have experienced 2 game breaking bugs: for the first one; the entire screen freezes except for the mini-map, for the second; the game sometimes gets stuck in an infinite loading sequence. in both of these scenarios, i ultimately have to shut the game down via the task manager. overall i am quite impressed, but also completely confounded by how unstable the online can be at times; especially considering the copious amounts of time rockstar had to perfect this game on pc. i will rate this game as an 8.5 for now. my opinion will very likely increase if rockstar remedies the online issues and as more enjoyable mods arrive.",54.2
"best graphics on pc, they go as realistic as it is possible with current hardware. framerate is awesome. few bugs here and there, memory leak, connection issues that might frustrate living  out of you, but nothing that wont be fixed in a month. menus are a bit confusing, but nothing is that perfect.. as for gameplay.. only in this game you can just drive around, see 2 guys next to their broken car, stop next to them and with thought need any help? approach them just so that one of them would tell you wanna loose some teeth?! and punch you.",127.7

"waited years for this game to finally be released on pc, only to spend what already seems like years trying to get the game running properly. i was blessed to actually have the damn thing run on my computer, only to find that i get constant stutter on my mid-end gaming pc, no matter what settings i put it to. i have done countless things both in game and out to try and get it to run smooth at 60 on any setting, sadly this seems like an unachievable goal thanks to poor optimization for any computer that isnt over the top and super pricy. i can get smooth 60 frames when playing for the first while, then slowly my game will degrade over time (stuttering) until it is totally unplayable, even as i sit here with the game in the background, typing this review on steam lags to an extreme degree. i will finish this off by listing my specs for you guys to see; gtx660 2 gb vram msi oc to 1150mhz (350.12 drivers), 8 gb 1333mhz ram, 1tb harddrive (hitachi hds721010cla332), i7 2600s @ 2.80ghz. if this rig isnt enough to run the game at 60fps smooth with the lowest settings, rockstar you really did mess up your optimization.... its not even that the game doesnt run at 60fps, its that there is this constant stutter that worsens the longer you play. i can run the game at 60fps and it does truly look stunning, however the stutter that is constant and never ending is what pulls me out of the immersion and really pisses me off.",57.8

"finished the game on ps3 a while ago, but for the pc version: + i expected first person mode to be a gimmick that wasnt really functional, but it works well. even taking cover during combat works in first person mode. the movement controls also become standard fps controls, e.g. your character moves at a running speed by default and sprints when you press shift, whereas in third person mode your character will walk by default rather than run. + performance is surprisingly good. on a single gtx 970, i am running the game maxed at 1920x1080 and the frame rate has never dropped below 60 fps. if i remove my 60 fps frame rate cap, its usually hovering 70+. seems like rockstar learned from gta4s poor optimization on pc. the graphics quality : performance ratio is very good. + lots of graphics options. + m+kb controls are much better than gta4. all menus work well with the mouse. + high frame rate support for high refresh rate monitors. - mouse input seems to have no acceleration, but is tied to frame rate, so you need a constant frame rate for consistent mouse input. if your frame rate changes your mouse speed can become stupidly fast or very slow. - rockstar social club is still a thing, rather than being fully integrated with steam. havent had any crashes or issues yet, but ive just started. overall seems like a high quality port, especially compared to the last one.",14.9

"deciding to take a break from the daily grind of robbing people and commiting selfish acts of violence in substantial proportions i decided to do a little bike ride to the beach one morning. i hopped on my motorcycle and began driving it along the gorgeous coast. the sun was bright, the sky was crystal blue and the breeze was flowing ever so gently through my hair. upon arriving at the pier i pulled my bike over and parked it next to an old burger joint. i saw that the handicap spot was the only one available so i took. i figured handicap people dont have fun at the beach anyway so why let the space go to waste. as i walked onto the sand i was greeted by the nicest people i have ever met. some said f*ck you while others were simply repulsed by my beauty and ran away. i know my physical attractiveness and sharp manly appearance can be too much for one to handle, especially the ladies, so i accepted their social ackwardness toward me. after enjoying the serenity of the beach and its patrons i headed toward the pier to check out the festivities and maybe get a beer at the local pub. walking there was amazing and littered with so many diverse people. i ran into some druggies, a hillbilly, dead beat dads and some bros who just finished working out. all of them showed an agressive attitude toward me but i simply assoicated that with my strikingly good looks. they must of seen it as an immediate threat as tons of gorgeous women were around me. i continued to walk down the pier to the end to discover a guy named xhit123 or something of that nature. he was standing on the railing just over the water. it must of been a 100 foot drop to the ocean. as i approached he quickly blurted out, stay back! stay back or ill do it! ill jump!. immediately my pleasent day has turned into a life saving venture. i think back to when my friend attempted to get a full body tatoo and i talked him out of it. you dont want to do this. i replied. i have no choice! my kids f*cking hate me and i caught my wife banging another dude. he said, i responded gently, seeing that he was on edge a little. why dont you come down from there and i will get you a beer. we can even play a round of darts and i will be on your team. how does that sound? he paused for a moment before stepping down. he said, lets get drunk. lets. i said. so a beautiful day turned magical as i met a new drinking buddy. only in gta v. damn i love this game.",48.8

"while the game has a lot of additional features added for the pc release, i expected a far more stable product after waiting 18 months. it crashes nearly constently even with a powerful system. the crashes have been so prevalent i havent been able to progress anywhere in the storyline due to it crashsing roughly every 5 minutes. you can practically set your clock by how regularly this game will freeze or crash. very similar to the gtaiv port. honestly if you want to enjoy gtav, youd be better off buying a console that can run it competently instead of the pc version. i feel honestly like i wasted sixty dollars on this game because, in all reality, i cant play it. if i could, id ask for a refund from steam because it in reality its a defunctional product incapable of delivering what it promised. not sure why i thought this would be different from ivs port, but its the exact same. you can set all the graphics options as low as theyll go and the game will still crash on a regular basis. avoid the pc version at all costs. i mean even if a buddy you vaguely know has the game on a console, youre better off playing it that way than playing the pc version. at least the console versions work. defective product. terrible customer service. ive lost a lot of respect for rockstar. even if you have no other way to play the game, avoid the pc version, because its not a game, its an application that crashes more than a malaysian airliner.",14.7

"great game does need some more work on fps atm. i notice you can get 59 fps here and then drop down turn when around to 20 fps in alot areas ! missions are alot fun they added some new ones and the combate is better then console also ! i still cant wait for mods in this game to come out ! the online is just like a mmo also 10/10",25.2

(i still wont recommend amd tho) everything else with the game is just great! apart from the fact they have have made modding very hard which sucks. over all i would recommend this game to anyone or everyone!",26.8

"who releases a game three times and smashes records doing it? rockstar. simply put, gta v is the kind of game you will always leave installed and play a few hours a week. remember tony hawks games? i always left it in my playstation just because i knew when i wanted to play games, thats the first one id start with. thats exactly that kind of game. i bought it two times, and never looked back on any seconds of it. more than 300 hours on playstation, and im starting it all over again just because of how amazing this game is. get it now! whoever doesnt take the time to enjoy this masterpiece dont deserve to be a gamer.",40.3
"ive been playing this on console since its release back in september of 13. still fun to play and i still have not seen all there is to see. i learn new things about the game all the time. oh man the 60fps is amazing coming from a regular 30.",44.2
"while i was initially on the fence about buying this game, having a load of my friends planning to play it on release pulled me over and made me buy it. in hindsight, i shouldnt have done that, a waste of 60 euros. gameplay wise, its decent. its the standard gta gameplay that were all used to, but its starting to show its age. sure, the game looks good, but all that comes at a price. 60gb install is killer, and to top it all off, i had to do it twice (thats steams fault, but still, 60 is a lot). it also causes loading times to be insanely long which can be irritating if you have to load stuff again and again and again. but thats still manageable, the real downsides are far more irritating. to start off, the game forces you to go through the prologue in single player and then some incredibly obscure (in the sense of, you know what it is) tutorials before youre even allowed to play with your friends in multiplayer. really? furthermore, getting together with your friends in the game is an absolute nightmare. seriously rockstar, what part of good user interface do you not understand? a decent interface is one where you can instinctively find any and all options and do everything you want without having to go through whatever else, not what we have right now. for a game that flaunts its multiplayer aspect like this one does, it disappoints horribly. to start a special game session (invite only, crew only,...), you need to go to the offline part of the game, in order to then start the online bit again, which is accompanied by a long load time every single time. furthermore, connection issues are rampant, people get dropped randomly, most of the time when going into a job, only those that joined you in it will rejoin you in an open session leaving the others stranded and having to connect again... the list goes on. on top of that, they didnt bother implementing support for anything else but a gamepad or keyboard/mouse. joystick owners everywhere are annoyed with you now. on a side note, im horribly disappointed that rockstar decided to implement silly things such as tennis, or golf, but didnt bother to implement oculus rift, or even trackir support. both of which can make the game incredibly more immersive and enjoyable to play for a relative minimum of effort required. instead, we get the following quote: we see no reason to innovate in terms of business models. we prefer to be a fast follower. no one else can make our intellectual property -- only we can. im happy to have other people spend loads of dough on r&d. this coming from one of the most successful game companies in the business nowadays, who are rolling in money so to speak, refusing to innovate. instead preferring to just milking out their franchise to get even more money while they wait. and the worst part of it is that this is a recurring thing in todays gaming industry. all in all, im very much disappointed, even though my expectations were low to start. id give this game a 5.5/10, merely due to the fact that it makes it such a frustrating experience due to the interface and matchmaking. had that been well done, the game wouldve received a solid 8.5/10 from me, but sadly enough, this isnt the case. this is the last time i will be buying a product from rockstar and i strongly recommend you do the same and dont buy this game, or any other game from this company.",17.8
"it was really really good and then it got revoked from my account because the guy i bought it from did a chargeback on his credit card. ive sent a steam ticket to try and get it back but they probably wont respond for a while and even if they do i dont know if ill even get the game or my 22 keys back. 10/10 the worst thing is its all my fault",13.4

"best pc port of all time, amazing gameplay, you need this game. i only had one issue after installing it was a corrupted file, it was fixed with the validation tool in steam within 20 minutes, not a deal breaker in any sense. i own the game on the 360 and have beat it twice, i started back in single player again and have not made it to multiplayer as of yet as the immersion is a fantastic experience. im sure the online portion is great i just have not wanted to tear myself away from story mode (for the third time)..",53.0

"i was scared that it wouldnt work, because i still cant get gta4 to play because of windows live errors. gta 5 makes you log in through social club but its not nearly as bad. i have all the recommended specs and then some. the game is beautiful. i have the game on ps3 but havent played it in so long that im ok with starting over. there are some new features - new cars, first person mode and online heists. i love 3rd person but 1st person feels extremely immersive, like youre in the city. i dont need to see the back of my characters head. also shooting controls are great with a mouse. no need for auto aim. driving is tough though. i do have a controller and its a lot better with that. to sum it up, the game runs great. nvidia came out with a driver last night, so i was good to go.",28.4

"this game is amazing! i have waited for it to come out for pc since it release on the last gen consoles.. thats like, 2 and a half years i was waiting!! and it was definitely worth the wait. for sure, the best version of gta 5 availiable. 60fps is unreal, it feels like a whole new game compared to xbone, and xbox 360. i cant wait till mods start to release for this game. still cant believe how beautiful this game is, i have only played for about 25 hours now, and have taked 250+ screenshots! lol, all round great game.",44.4
"single player is awesome, i really hope they can bring back the jazz radio (the one in gta4, its my favourite radio channel) multiplayer is quite laggy at the moment (i know it is just released) also, it automatically switches my character to another server when im on a mission. lack of options on appearance (e.g. cant change body shape, clothes are not good looking as well....) biggest issue is heist, if one player leaves, the whole mission failed, it would be nice if the missing player is replaced by bot. also, everytime i died, my screen freezes and not be abled to play the restarted mission unless the host die as well. (sure rock star will patch it in the furture) overall an awesome game, 9/10 (would be 10/10 if they fix",43.3

"gta v single player might be fun but i havent played it except to unlock online. im bored of gta online. something about the level/money grind, random ai headshots thatll instantly kill you, and the sync system that would rather sync the random civilians, weather and traffic than position data across the internet. the fact it plays more like a tactical cover shooter yet 90% of missions are out in the open with tons of nothing between you and the enemy and the fact the online is kind of annoying in how you have to spend more time setting up a game with friends than it takes to join a bunch of random s. also fps stutters which when tied to the problems of online play makes it a bigger mess.",53.4
"the best game ive ever played. but the launcher is still broken. and the only way i can play is by disabiling my graphics card, starting the game, and hoping i can re-enable it before the social club loads. i have emailed, facebook, and submitted a ticket to rockstar, but not one response, no patch, nothing. they took my money, delayed the game, and still have not provided me with a finished, playable product. again, i want my money back. stay away for awhile until the game is patched and fully functional, otherwise risk all the current problems wreaking your experiance. the launcher is now functional for me, and as such, i can say get this game and play the **** out of it. play it alone. play it with friends. play it with strangers.",39.1

"so far great game! 10/10! at first i wasnt really into the whole 3 character story mode thing, but it eventually grew on me, and now i really like how the story is unveiled through different perspectives. it can also be a little confusing at first as to how to advance the story since theres sooo much to do in the game. driving is fun in this game too! each car handles a little differently and the first person mode makes it feel like another game in and of itself. online mode is also really fun. it goes without saying, but of course heists go much better when you have friends to coordinate with, instead of random people doing their own thing. not anyones nor the games fault, just something that is what it is, ya know de facto and all that jazz. so yeah, make your friends buy it too!!",41.0

"grand theft auto is currently my favourite game. ive mostly played online where you work your way through jobs and heists, along the way buying nice cars and sweet apartments. after playing with the graphics settings a bit, i can now play at ~55 fps on mostly maxed out settings with an r9 290x gpu. some small things that i dont like is that you are not able to transfer your single player progress from your console to your pc. i also dont like how when youre hosting a heist most of the time one person leaves half way through or just really sucks at the game, and believe me, one person makes a difference between completing a heist and failing. one time, after finally finding a good heist group we were 3 minutes from completing the heist. the guy who was piloting the helicopter crashed it. you can guess how angry we all were. i found that people are more reliable not to drop out if they have a mic and the heists are also a lot easier that way because communication is a lot better! i also love that you can hot-swap between a keyboard and a controller. you can be using the controller to drive your car around and you can quickly swap to keyboard if you need to escape on foot. investing in a controller is definately worth it. if you have a wired xbox 360 controller you can use it to play, but i am using a wireless xbox controller using an adapter i found on ebay for about $10. overall gta v is a great game both single player and online, i just wish rockstar supported mods. thanks for reading my review! if you want to join me in heists just send me a friend request through social club. my username is: e1ghtspace make sure you have a mic though, otherwise you wont really be much help (unless you use the chat, in which case feel free to send a friend request)",47.3

"ive been playing gta since it was top-down, and i put in ~300 hours on the 360 version of gta v as well. ive since sold the xbox, but have been maintaining and rebuilding my battlestation since then. needless to say, i was only slightly miffed i had to drop another $60 to pick it up another time. i was a little apprehensive about the game being a poor port ala gta iv, but it turned out there was no need to be. the game runs absolutely awesome for me, the only drawback springing to mind are some long load times, despite all 60+ gb of the game being installed on an ssd. ive noticed this mainly in multiplayer though, with an initial long load in sp then generally shorter ones thereafter. the graphics are mindblowing, and there are a lot of sliders in the options, giving you the opportunity to really fine-tune your settings and figure out what works best for you. after minimal configuration, im running at a bare minimum 60fps at all times and still marveling at just about everything in-game. playing with a mouse and keyboard was a simple transition for me, i was a bit concerned at first and intended to just play with a 360 controller, but instantly fell in love with mouse aiming. gta shooting was never the greatest but its a lot more reliable and entertaining with the ability to be somewhat precise. all-in-all, i definitely see another 300 hours of this in my future. once some mods start pouring out this game has the potential to be a longlived classic.",20.4
"i have liked gta games mostly overall, with some complaints here and there. this game is the total package. it has kept me playing and doesnt get old or boring. you never know whats around the corner in gta 5, buy this game, i promise you wont regret it.",57.2

"just excellent! i didnt suppose that this game will run on my pc, because it is a normal thing nowadays when minimum requirements for the game are just meaningless - there is a very little chance that it will at least launch. however, i was very impressed when i saw a nice optimization - stable 30-50 fps in fact, that every spec of my pc is just as the same as the minimum requirement (i5-2320 3.0 ghz, gtx 550ti, 4 gb ram). the game itself is the best thing ever done for the whole gaming industry - not more not less. rockstar did its job well. 10/10.",39.9
"+ im surprised how well this game runs on very high settings, single player and multiplayer. (gtx 670 overclocked) + lots of graphic setting options. + new soundtrack + hasnt crashed once + day one multiplayer is working + first person view is great - flying controls are little weird (maybe because i havent played gta on pc before)",8.8

"so imagine gta v on 360/ps3 was like the meal youve waited for all your life that tasted a little raw, but it was a good meal, yknow? then, youve got the ps4/one version that is the same meal cooked ever so slightly better, yet youre still hungry. this version is like, the real deal. the main entre. the dish youve been truly hungry for your whole life. and it may have taken a little longer for it to be done but you craved it even more. in the end, this is the most delicious meal of your life. you get everything and more, especially for those who can crank up to 11 (4k resolution, baby) even if youve bought this game before and thought youve done it all, dont overlook this well optimized glorious experience that will make your return to los santos ever so sweeter.",25.2
"a huge applause to rockstars customer service at lauch of gta v by giving everyone the opportunity to refund the game, whether they had several hours of game time or not, all because of a bug (which was not even a big deal to manually fix). first time to see a company offer refunds at day of launch. 10/10 would purchase from rockstar again.",4.8

"11/10 - its ok",40.9
"im very pleased with the port of this game, it runs well even on my -tier cpu. (fx-4100) the textures look great compared to the previous version i played on the last-generation consoles, even on the normal setting. the game has a very useful video memory gauge like the other rockstar ports which makes tweaking the options a cinch. i had no trouble transferring over my gta online character from the ps3 version, and the online so far hasnt given me any trouble in terms of connectivity. i did have some trouble with what seemed like mouse acceleration, and i was unable to find an option to disable it. but after changing from raw input to directinput it seems to be much better. all in all, id say it was worth the wait.",40.4
"basically a definitive version of console gta with new stuff",79.9
"ok if you have the gta launcher issue go on device managers, display adapters and disable your video card then it should run then enable the next time you start the game. now for the review its worth every penny. the gameplay is smooth, the game is great looking, havent tried online but ive heard very positive stuff about it and the game is just simply very very fun. if your pc can run this is a must buy",84.7
"holy  this game runs smooth and the graphics are amazing!",53.8
"gta v is finally released on pc, with much improvement from the previous gta iv release. it runs smooth 40-60fps even on my old hd6850. the same reaction when max payne 3 was released, why is this running smoothly on my old graphic card? rockstar has done a really good job on this. but still, 4 months of delay is pretty painful to wait.",45.4
"its okay. i expected much more. if you havent played it on any console before, buy it. if you have, i recommend you to not buy it. i played this on ps3 and ps4 as well, so i have some experience and knew how the game would be like. however, running at recommended specs (760 & fx-6630), i didnt find it to look any better than the ps4 version, other than the addition of 60 fps. and actually, some of the textures look worse than the ps4 version (this is at normal texture settings). definetely need a good desktop to run this at high settings, 1080p, 60 fps, and to make sure it looks better than the consoles. hopefully its just a bug on rockstars end, and might send out a patch to fix the graphics, but right now im not impressed.",18.9

"the best installation and port to the pc by rockstar games since max payne 3. they have learned from their mistakes and given us something that works great right after launch. the game is highly optimized than its counterparts and offers a lot of choices in terms of graphics settings which will keep the average pc gamer busy. for new players, it is extremely important to go through all the graphics settings as a misconfigured option could ruin the whole experience. otherwise, the game runs very smoothly and the online feature has no flaws. the only downsides in my opinion is the requirement of linking your social club account before you can play, and of course the massive 60gb filesize. but we live in 2015, games are bound to get larger, and hard drives will also get larger as standard. other than that, you are guaranteed to have the time of your life.",23.4

"some strapped on pc code to tote along a mixed style mess. first off, you have to create a social account, which means giving up your email address, a potentially good password, and some other information in order to play a the game in single player. after you create the account you have to go to rockstars website and turn off a ton of email spam waiting to happen. like i care whether some webstie tracks my single player stats. save this garbage for if i play the game long enough to go online. just using the menu system is sluggish. the mouse moves really slow, the menus draw like something out of dos. esc plops you on a social menu of some sort with a bunch of obscure keys that one does lead to a system menu. since the game started in windowed mode for some random reason that was the first thing to change. i noted all the settings didnt indicate whether they were max or not at a glance. what game doesnt do this out of the box? you can do global max settings and then adjust as needed. next you go through some pretty boring tutorial mission - go here, do this, use your phone, etc. for once ill say steal sr3s control sceme - fast, efficient, and doesnt involve wacking keys that in every other game actually do what one wants to do - crouch isnt where crouch normally is, prone isnt where prone normally is. if you dont do what the ai tells you it nags at you. initally after a few nags, the ai took over and did the task. so i did what anyone would do - went over and surfed the web, watched some video, and hoped the tutorial would move itself along. after about 10-15 minutes i switched back over and the ai was still yelling at me to do something. so the first time was a freak incident. as there was no other options available i drugded along another lame tutorial. which led me to the first beef i have - super twitch wasd controls in vehicles. w and d are either not being pressed or turning the car 100% left or right. so one either wears out the keyboard trying to drive efficiently (think old school galga) or smacking into everything. sr3 didnt have this issue. so you do the robery tutorial and think that is it for tutorials but noooo you get plopped into a car theft activity - get in a car follow some ai through the streets that instantly loses you if you go through a shortcut, and then get chased by the police in a confusing how do i escape the police activity. so the blue/red flashing dots are police, but if i dont see any on the map, how can they still be chasing me? how about since your wasting my time on something i could care less about while listening to some really crappy rap music there was no tutorial on how to change the game give a tutorial on what this whole cop chase thing is? so after some driving around, smacking into cop cars that magically appear in front of me (scotty, stop beaming in cop cars 50 away from me, ok?) i avoided them, dropped off the car, watch some bad acting, and then have to get into a car and drive. at this point all i can think of is after 4 games why rockstar hasnt figured out how to implement a custom main character just like sr3 has been doing since sr1? why are you wasting my time in a character i can not invest in, but dragging me through the chains of stagnation to do it? cmon, its 2015 where is my custom character at? and i quit playing after realizing things wouldnt get much more interesting... waste o money. save yours and wait until it hits $10 around xmas.",0.8

"this game is freaking awesome. i have it totally maxed out at 1920 x1080, at a steady 60. it has absolutely breathtaking visuals. it has been very friendly so far with crossfire 7970 lightnings. no issues at all. no flickering or other sli/crossfire common issues. it fired right up and worked great! i played about 10 minutes and was amazed, all the time after that was even better. first person view is so awesome. so much easier to drive. when i got to my safe house, moms house i am guessing, first thing i did was sit on the couch to watch the hilarious tv shows rockstar always puts on, my guy smoked a huge dank  jay, and started talking to himself. then i went to the gunshop and purchased a .45 automatic and a cqc submachine gun, there are a ton of mods, such as sound suppressors, optics, and all things that are good. next on my list is to bang some hookers and then get my money back with my .45 automatic. this game is sweet. 10/10 all around. graphics 10/10 gameplay 10/10 weed dankness 10/10 controls 10/10 (a lot to remember.) guns 10/10 physics 10/10",33.8

"i owned gtav for the xbox 360 and waited for the pc release to purchase it on a next gen system. it was well worth the wait. the graphics are simply amazing and first person view completely changes the game for me.",8.8

"ive been waiting for this game so long... and when it finally came out, i was not disappointed.",45.9
"ps4 version looks and runs better. it can feel nice for a bit at 60fps but frequent frame drops destroy the experience. there is also a very restrictive graphics options menu, as in you can change the options but the game will not let you play the game if it thinks you are out of memory. this can happen often as the game does not pick up on multiple graphics cards and large amounts of ram. a better port than gtaiv but its still not a high enough quality to warrant purchasing this version. only buy if you have a rig way above the reccomended settings and can afford a new hard drive because this is a resource hog and a disgusting large game to install. all in all the order for gta v goes ps4/xbone > pc >360/ ps3.",1.4
"it is just the best game i have ever played in my entired life! very well made! if the first person mode had the rear view mirrors with quality view at least for the driver i would call it 100%",27.4
"*pro tip, ignore the negative reviews that have 20+ hours of gameplay but their review states they are locked out of the game... by far the best game in the series. first person view mode is a great addition to an already fantastic game, crisp graphics and a video editor are just icing on the cake. story is good and improved from previous versions by having 3 main characters, all of which are introduced to eachother through some pretty funny circumstances. the multiplayer is top notch and considering it was a free update (from 360/ps3) its amazing rockstar has delivered as much as they did. heists improve the mp even further by giving you a team and multiple objectives to work towards a high payout. none of the previous gtaiv issues on pc are present and it really seems rockstar learned some valuable lessons from their previous release. i cant recommend this game enough.",21.4
"so.... i have a valid windows name, and yet when i launch gtav, social club crashes due to an unknown error. truly a shame i decided to pre download it if everything was for naught. currently uninstalling and reinstalling, hoping for the best. in the meanwhile, a big fat nope is a verdict if i cant even get past the login system.",30.7

"this.. i did not expect that. i really didnt. this game shows r* for what they truly are, a company that respects their fans. it shows r* in a good tone, theyre not just some money-grabbing company that doesnt give a damn about their players, no, theyre something more. and for that, i respect them back. as for the game, theres nothing to say, really. its extremely well optimized and well-made for the pc. all the graphics options are there, and since today, you can actually change your settings however you want to. even if you have a 1gb graphics card you can play on med-high settings with 60 fps. the game had a great launch, though at first i thought i wouldnt be able to play, because the game started for me minimized and at a crappy resolution with most of the graphics options set to normal and off. the online portion of the game is great, and its extremely well made. you can have up to 30 players in a lobby and still have constant 60 fps, which is just ground breaking for me. but, ofcourse, what a r* launch is it without f*ck ups, right? this time, thank god, it was nothing major. people that had their windows profiles written in other languages (i think it was only russian, im not quite sure.) couldnt launch/install or log in to the game properly. thankfuly, it was fixed in a couple of hours and everyone could play. now, i just wanted to talk about the fun aspect of the game. so, here we go. the game is extremely fun while played with a bunch of friends. you can do anything, from chasing your friends in an armed helicopter across the state, or rob banks, stores and so on. if youre a lone wolf, and you dont have any friends (jk not jk :d) you can always make some in-game with a new chat system. ofcourse, the voice comms are still there, and if im not mistaken, they have a new codec, which makes the voices even clearer. so, we waited. we waited long enough. was it worth it? yes, it was. were the delays worth it? abso-f**king-lutely. here we go, my final verdict is a 9/10. keep in mind, that it wasnt a perfect launch, and that the game for some people (me included) is almost 2,5 years old. if i didnt play it on the console, it would have been a 10/10, but i just cant undo my multiple playthroughs on the console.",71.8

"this is a great game that i would strongly recomend to anyone who loves just cause, other gta instalments or even open world adventure/action games. it has a vast array of activities or missions from killing cops to doing yoga (as featured in one of the many trailers). although it may be fun, the many activities are kind of a selling point for the game and generally they give way to the imfamous ultra-violence typical to gta. basically, some of the games are used only to boast of the games size and people maily will ignore them. i strongly recomend that you read and compare the system requirements due to the fact that it is a very demanding game and that playing gta 5 in 600x800 with half a second delay is, while semi-playable, extremly disapointing and worth nowhere near the cost of the game. i would deffinetly recomend the game to any casual or extreme gamer as it is an all-round fun time (+ we pc gamers get to laugh at the console players trying to aim on controller!!!).",0.3

"i recommend this game for pvpers and single players. i do not recomment this game for the co-op experience. and not for its price for the co-op experience. buyer beware. lets start with the prolouge that you have to complete first. we pre-ordered. proluge / tutorial problems: i spawn into a place not knowing what on earth is even going on. i am told to grab a money bag and then i am taught later how to switch chacracters. how to shoot etc. how to pick up ammo but the weirdest most confusing this of all is spending 10 minutes in a room being asked to take cover. it turns out only one magical crate could be used to take cover. not being new to gaming i try every single side of the walls in there and look up in game settings such as keybindings for help. i find that they pc version of taking cover is the letter q. the tutorial failed at explaining that. i had to dig for assistance. 1 crate can only be used while the other ais run around and use whatever cover the please like using making me so confused. once i find the 1 and only crate which isnt even highlighted or anything, then taking cover begins. after this, an explosion happens and then the tutorial tells me its q to take cover. not to mention the lack of organization with key bindings. some keys do multiple things and if you want to assign any key bindings to a gaming keyboard that can use it or to a higher end gaming mouse, forget it. no dice! the game wont allow it. later i get a cheap cut scene and we are in the snow area. 2 of my ais die but only one of them earn a funeral. i am even more confused. you are taught to shoot again and again. eventually you make it out of there and later you learn to drive and do a series of other quests. eventually you finish and end up at your safe house and you are left wondering, i am stuck on any these 3 characters or how do i make my own? thats the sort of thing that should be available at the main menu. it gets worse. you keep doing quests because you are told if you dont that you cant even connect to gta online. when you try to connect to gta online you are told to go back and complete the other stuff. and who the f*** uses a load screen as a main menu? talk about confusing and preposterous. so if you cant see the semi blurry screen at the bottom or if you finish loading, you have now missed your chance to click on story mode. wtf! so now on to co-op. here you load up into gta online after saving your game thinking yay!!!! now i can finally host a game and play with friends who all over paid 60 bucks for a 2 yr old game that some other countries paid 30 bucks for it. so after you spend another 30 mins going through steam discussions you finally find a person that can explain to you how to host a game. load the game, while its loading looking for any signs for story mode. you find it trying to rush before the game loads. you click story mode to end up back on franklin and you finally click game, then play gta online, then friends. only to find out when you load up that it doesnt sync with steam at all. okay now you and your friends take 30 mins to try to find each other. you each get an avatar, you each get a name, you each create rockstar accts as required by the game makers just to play with other people. only to find out that the menu you need is an obstacle because its crashing non stop and in beween crashes you are trying to get your acct set up and add your friends to the friends list. now with all of you going through crashes its now been 5 hours and you are ready for bed and still havent had any fun. day 2, the return to gta onlne still hoping to play with other your friends and not these pvp maniacs. alright so now that every one is added to the friends list, you can now click on friends and once you click on them you go over to another sub menu where now you can select send game invite. omg getting one step closer. but all these other pvp maniacs are on your game and you cant get any thing done because you are all dieing. you start to wonder if you will ever have a co-op experience at all. you go through more menu settings really digging and at last you find an option to turn off spectator mode and to make it so matchmaking is off so these ppl stop invading your games to kill you when all you want to do is play the fu**ing game with your friends. okay so now you communicate and share all these other steps with them and its been another 4 hours gone by. you follow all the same steps again and finally ppl can connect to you and you dont have weird creepy ppl in your session and now at last you can play? wrong! so so so wrong! still no co-op experience. nope. you realise that you have no jobs at all. no missions light up. nothing! and you spend another 2 hours trying to figure out why and what went wrong? well you finally figure it out. since they are insistant that their loading menus are main menus, when you finally create your own character, you didnt notice the tiny little itty bitty letters at the lower right of the screen that asks you if you want to skip the gta online tutorial and the it loaded up and now you have to make a brand new character and do this all over again. still no co-op gaming experience at all. still no one is playing together. wtf is going on here! this will make or break the game for you. because if you skipped it, you start all over again even if you completed the prolouge / tutorial for the main game. this doesnt mean you completed the tutorial for gta online which is only offered to you after you create your character from yet another load screen. omg! what on earth is their facination with menus in loadscreens? at this point some of you want refunds for the game because its been like 2 days and no one can play together as of yet! okay so you all go and make new characters now and then you find out that until level five the missions arent unlocked and you must continue to do a series of more quests that only teach you to shoot, introduce you to pvp and then force you to pvp mean while you only wanted to meet up with friends, do your co-op and get to playing already!!! the gta online tutorial more junk you already did the day prior. how to drive, how to shoot, etc. only this time you have to run around and be forced to do races and shoot other ppl as part of the requirement just so you can have missions available to finally do your quests with your friends. but there you are being held back, interrupted unable to play with friends. you get a ton of cutscenes that dont go well with the story. you are lost. you have no clue what if going on. how to navigate through the menus. and everything is taking so much time. and every thing is in your god darn way of just playing with ppl you want to play with. so you continue doing these useless pvp quests. getting attacked, getting shot, or losing matches still with no clue as to wtf to do or why any of this is even relavant to the story and why you are now flying into an air port. did you spawn earlier in a bank and had to rob it and escape? but now you are with other people in the story and flying in but you have no idea how the  you even got there. and he entire time people are telling you on missions to eat their rear ends or you are you called a a non stop or a lo or loc or whatever and all you wanted to do was play the darn game. but thats looks like its just not happening. day 3: you log back in hoping on your spare time that every one got done with all their gta online tutorial on the second characters everyone had to make. you hope every one is level 5 now and that every one has missions unlocked even if they all have those missions unlocked in single player. only to find out some didnt finish from lack of time. you are still there waiting for co-op to begin.",90.0

"i have been anticipating this release for a very long time, my main worry was if my machine would be able to run it or not. i game on a laptop. i have an asus g73jw with a core i7-740qm - 1.73 ghz (on initial install of the game it did complain that my proc was below minimum, maybe because its a mobile) my video card is a geforce gtx-480m with 1.5 gb of vram. and i have 8gb of memory. i am happy to say that i can play gta5, in fact my perfomance is even much better than it had been with gta4. i chose the default settings and wich were medium/low 1920-1080 and my frame rate was at a solid 30fps, didnt budge up or down. i decided to experiment a little with the settings and a very strange thing began happening. i changed the texture settings from low to medium. my frame rate went from 30fps to high 30s. i thought this may be a fluke so i tried setting them to high, it then increased to mid 40s, i am now running on textures at very high and my frames are between 50-60fps. im not sure how this is possible, maybe some how its taking some of the load from proc and putting it more on the vid card? or better utilizing the memory ? this is all i have realy changed other than turning the vsync on to half (this cleaned up alot of the jaggies without any noticable negative impact) i may experiment further to see what else i can tweak to make it even better. it just goes to show that lower is not always better, experiment with the settings a little you may be surprised too. i hope that my review can give some hope to people out there that may be worried that thier machine is not up to running this game as thier specs may not even meet the minimum system requirements. when i saw that my machine wouldnt even come close to minimum on that (canirunit) website i began to debate about buiding a cheap desktop with some modern parts just so i could play gta5. im glad that i didnt jump the gun and gave it a shot on my old machine first. rockstar has done a fantastic job on this release, it was worth the wait. gorgeous graphics, plays very smooth, its fun, its sassy, its full of gta goodness. but most of all it will play just fine on an older machine like mine. like i said, hope this helps out a little and hope to see yall in game.",88.9

"played on ps3, and it was great. i couldnt wait to get my hands on this on pc and just play the way its meant to be. but... rough launch issues are killing the hype and happiness: 1) launcher crashes unless i disable my nvidia card from the device manager first. 2) game content takes too long to load, causing missing textures, models, animations, sounds. 3) can get 60fps on lowest graphics on this old laptop, but cpu usage is sawtooth and it fluctuates between 17fps and 60fps in about 2 seconds, and it keeps repeating this pattern, making the game more or less unplayable. 4) got a 16gb ssd, one of those first ones. game files are not grouped in a folder > i cant symlink the files > slow loading times. game aspects: great! technical aspects: not so much. do i recommend? if you have an ssd big enough to keep the entirety of the game, and a relatively good computer: yes. rockstar, please patch the game, i want to get my moneys worth.",60.8
"dont say nope to dope! - gta5 in-game advertisement overall, this game is worth the purchase and i would recommend it to a friend. pros: huge area to explore plenty of vehicles lots of intuitive street activity great character dialog awesome music (radio stations and cut-scenes) fight aliens and zombies in side missions once i get further into the missions and i finally fly some aircraft, i will most likely be more thrilled than i currently am. but at the moment i do have a few gripes... cons: - graphics arent as clean as i expected (settings maxed) - clumsy controls (character smacks into walls when attempting to jump them, character gets turned around and takes too long to correct positioning especially while in a shootout) - firing range is buggy (screen went blurry, shooting range didnt initiate, locked into the room, police called when i fired the weapon, wasted by cops) - pause menu is poorly designed (must scroll over to the game menu just to exit, *save and exit options should always be in the primary list of options) - tutorial dialog appears on the screen while diving a vehicle, which makes it almost impossible to read while avoiding a crash - must download extras from the internet instead of being rewarded in-game (the dog, chop, doesnt obey wothout a download, exclusive cars must be obtained online)",39.5

"a really good port. i have an i5 second gen with a gtx770 (2gb) and 8gbs of ram and i cun run it with high-ultra settings at 1080p 60fps (with only fxaa, cant afford fancier msaa with the way i fine-tuned). you will have to fiddle around with a few things in order to get the really nice textures (if you have a 770), but all other graphics options are easy to pull off. it would probably look a lot like a slightly better 1080p version of the 360 and ps3 versions if you only have 1gb of vram though, since the textures make a huge difference from normal to high. pretty much it though. plenty of settings to fine tune. rockstar is making sure that you have the control here. the story and gameplay are great, never repetitive and the story missions use everything from the sky to the bottom of the ocean of san andreas to keep you entertained. played the ps3 version and its the same here. if you havent played gta v at all yet, youre missing out on the best gta game. first-person is surprisingly solid. im enjoying it more than i thought. the rockstar editor and director mode are insanely fun. overall very pleased. if you noticed i said nothing negative about the game in this review its because i really cant think of anything for this release. im glad rockstar decided to take their time because its a great pc game out of the box.",22.6

"amazing port. i was really afraid of the port being similar to the one of gta iv in the beginning, but they took their time, which initially annoyed me a little, but in retrospect i must say it definetely paid off. the graphics are amazing and even with a medium-end computer rig, the game looks beautiful and runs at a stable 60 frames per second most of the time. there havent been any issues that ive run into so far and im praying that it will stay this way. all in all great game, great port and definetely worth the money! thank you, rockstar! perhaps i can get my girlfriend to get a copy and play with me ;)",22.6

"i recommend this game for pvpers and single players. i do not recomment this game for the co-op experience. and not for its price for the co-op experience. buyer beware. lets start with the prolouge that you have to complete first. we pre-ordered. proluge / tutorial problems: i spawn into a place not knowing what on earth is even going on. i am told to grab a money bag and then i am taught later how to switch chacracters. how to shoot etc. how to pick up ammo but the weirdest most confusing this of all is spending 10 minutes in a room being asked to take cover. it turns out only one magical crate could be used to take cover. not being new to gaming i try every single side of the walls in there and look up in game settings such as keybindings for help. i find that they pc version of taking cover is the letter q. the tutorial failed at explaining that. i had to dig for assistance. 1 crate can only be used while the other ais run around and use whatever cover the please like using making me so confused. once i find the 1 and only crate which isnt even highlighted or anything, then taking cover begins. after this, an explosion happens and then the tutorial tells me its q to take cover. not to mention the lack of organization with key bindings. some keys do multiple things and if you want to assign any key bindings to a gaming keyboard that can use it or to a higher end gaming mouse, forget it. no dice! the game wont allow it. later i get a cheap cut scene and we are in the snow area. 2 of my ais die but only one of them earn a funeral. i am even more confused. you are taught to shoot again and again. eventually you make it out of there and later you learn to drive and do a series of other quests. eventually you finish and end up at your safe house and you are left wondering, i am stuck on any these 3 characters or how do i make my own? thats the sort of thing that should be available at the main menu. it gets worse. you keep doing quests because you are told if you dont that you cant even connect to gta online. when you try to connect to gta online you are told to go back and complete the other stuff. and who the f*** uses a load screen as a main menu? talk about confusing and preposterous. so if you cant see the semi blurry screen at the bottom or if you finish loading, you have now missed your chance to click on story mode. wtf! so now on to co-op. here you load up into gta online after saving your game thinking yay!!!! now i can finally host a game and play with friends who all over paid 60 bucks for a 2 yr old game that some other countries paid 30 bucks for it. so after you spend another 30 mins going through steam discussions you finally find a person that can explain to you how to host a game. load the game, while its loading looking for any signs for story mode. you find it trying to rush before the game loads. you click story mode to end up back on franklin and you finally click game, then play gta online, then friends. only to find out when you load up that it doesnt sync with steam at all. okay now you and your friends take 30 mins to try to find each other. you each get an avatar, you each get a name, you each create rockstar accts as required by the game makers just to play with other people. only to find out that the menu you need is an obstacle because its crashing non stop and in beween crashes you are trying to get your acct set up and add your friends to the friends list. now with all of you going through crashes its now been 5 hours and you are ready for bed and still havent had any fun. day 2, the return to gta onlne still hoping to play with other your friends and not these pvp maniacs. alright so now that every one is added to the friends list, you can now click on friends and once you click on them you go over to another sub menu where now you can select send game invite. omg getting one step closer. but all these other pvp maniacs are on your game and you cant get any thing done because you are all dieing. you start to wonder if you will ever have a co-op experience at all. you go through more menu settings really digging and at last you find an option to turn off spectator mode and to make it so matchmaking is off so these ppl stop invading your games to kill you when all you want to do is play the fu**ing game with your friends. okay so now you communicate and share all these other steps with them and its been another 4 hours gone by. you follow all the same steps again and finally ppl can connect to you and you dont have weird creepy ppl in your session and now at last you can play? wrong! so so so wrong! still no co-op experience. nope. you realise that you have no jobs at all. no missions light up. nothing! and you spend another 2 hours trying to figure out why and what went wrong? well you finally figure it out. since they are insistant that their loading menus are main menus, when you finally create your own character, you didnt notice the tiny little itty bitty letters at the lower right of the screen that asks you if you want to skip the gta online tutorial and the it loaded up and now you have to make a brand new character and do this all over again. still no co-op gaming experience at all. still no one is playing together. wtf is going on here! this will make or break the game for you. because if you skipped it, you start all over again even if you completed the prolouge / tutorial for the main game. this doesnt mean you completed the tutorial for gta online which is only offered to you after you create your character from yet another load screen. omg! what on earth is their facination with menus in loadscreens? at this point some of you want refunds for the game because its been like 2 days and no one can play together as of yet! okay so you all go and make new characters now and then you find out that until level five the missions arent unlocked and you must continue to do a series of more quests that only teach you to shoot, introduce you to pvp and then force you to pvp mean while you only wanted to meet up with friends, do your co-op and get to playing already!!! the gta online tutorial more junk you already did the day prior. how to drive, how to shoot, etc. only this time you have to run around and be forced to do races and shoot other ppl as part of the requirement just so you can have missions available to finally do your quests with your friends. but there you are being held back, interrupted unable to play with friends. you get a ton of cutscenes that dont go well with the story. you are lost. you have no clue what if going on. how to navigate through the menus. and everything is taking so much time. and every thing is in your god darn way of just playing with ppl you want to play with. so you continue doing these useless pvp quests. getting attacked, getting shot, or losing matches still with no clue as to wtf to do or why any of this is even relavant to the story and why you are now flying into an air port. did you spawn earlier in a bank and had to rob it and escape? but now you are with other people in the story and flying in but you have no idea how the  you even got there. and he entire time people are telling you on missions to eat their rear ends or you are you called a a non stop or a lo or loc or whatever and all you wanted to do was play the darn game. but thats looks like its just not happening. day 3: you log back in hoping on your spare time that every one got done with all their gta online tutorial on the second characters everyone had to make. you hope every one is level 5 now and that every one has missions unlocked even if they all have those missions unlocked in single player. only to find out some didnt finish from lack of time. you are still there waiting for co-op to begin.",90.0

"this is not what i payed money for!!!!! get rid of social club... absolutely pointless!! it just give off the feel of a sleezy middleman. (steam/valve & rockstar sort it out!!! unlike a lot off people, my copy actually launched into the game. it seemed that all was well untill the game poped up in window. (played with all the graphics setting possible but mainly with: aspect ratio, windowed/fullscreen mode. nothing. always windowed no matter what) so i found a resolution that i can play on and ok, i played for 3 hours. (in windowed mode) i must also say that i did buy this game with a mate of mine. after some persudading from my mate i bought the game.... and his copy does not launch at all. but the main issue for me is the fact that..... it took how long to release?? (2 years, 3 delayes) in good faith i thought... not rockstar but unfortunately yes the launch is now ed for me, as well as many other people! just pure frustration and the feel or getting ripped off once again by devs! (devs which we all thought were 1st class) the verdict: i am willing to give rockstar & steam/valve 2 weeks to fix this game. after that i am handing this game back to steam and will demand a refund. these fixes or updates must be in the format of autoupdates through steam and not social club or anything else.

"pros and cons... well, only one con. as a long time fan of the series, i loved gta 5 on the ps4. but playing it now on pc, my mind is blown. basically everything looks better, much much better, execpt one fault... the one con... player models. basically with everything else looking almost photorealistic, the stilted player models really stand out as being sub-par. (sub-par compared to the rest of the graphics... i do understand that rendering faces is one of the hardest things to do in a game). but everything else looks amazing. i mean, i keep losing track of my missions because i get too distracted by driving through this gorgeous town, with seemingly more people to make it lively, and more variety in character models. as for performance, rockstar did an awesome job of refining and streamlining. my rig played the game at fullest settings at 4k resolution pretty darn well. i was lazy and forgot to look at my fps counter to see my frame rate, but it was fairly smooth with some apparent frame rate drops. i decided to see how smoother it would get if i dropped to 1080 resolution instead (as i feel sometimes too high a resolution can look weird anyhow). at 1080, it was blazingly fast and smooth and i baely noticed any graphical difference. whats also awesome is that they included a sort of gpu performance meter. so as you select options, the game will tell you how much it thinks your gpu will be taxed. to compare, my rig: mobo: asus x99-deluxe processor: i7-5820k haswell-e 6-core 3.3ghz gpu: evga geforce gtx 980 ram: 16gb ddr4 (crap brand, and slower speed to save $ on my build). i cant freaking wait until enb and graphic/gameplay mods start rolling in. illalso finally dip my feet into online play (which i didnt lilke on the console, but want to get into now). even though i played the ps4 version probably up to 100 hours, ill replay the entire campaign and spend another 200 hours on this version, im sure. gta is always one of those games you can just pick up and casually play if you want random fun and chaos.",19.4

"crashes for no reason. im not the only one with these issues, a friend of mine couldnt even start the game. downloaded drivers specificly made for this game and obviously they didnt chance anything about the game chrases. for the amount of money that you have to pay for a game that crashes or (for some) dosnt even start isnt even worth it. gameplay, multiplayer. the game (exept for the obvious programming issues) is fun to play. though it can get repetetiv really fast but you can still have some fun if not alot of it if you get lucky and can play the game. there is alot of small things you can do like training among other things. you can even do jobs like robbing a target or stealing something like a car or other things but those jobs are handed to you at random and you can go for a longer period of time not able to do anything but wait for them to come in. to be able to do heists you need to be atleast level 12 or higher and i had some difficulties to get to that level (can be my retardness) because of the lack of things to grind. another downside is that things are overcomplicated, finding jobs for and then manage to get the group together into that level can be a real pain in the . + if you get a so called job its random if you get to even be the host. another thing its a small thing but still if /when you wanna get a apartment you cant preview it (from the inside) which i think would be given but still so when you find a apartment you will have to spend that half a million in just faith that it turns out into a good apartment. settings. i miss some of settings also, for example you cant chance voice chat settings for yourself so when you use your mick you cant (for example) set it so only people close by or people in your crew can only hear you. it (what i can find) is always set so you speak to everyone on the server. atm i would give the game a 6/10 mostly because of the crashes and , if i ignore those issues i would probably give it a 7.5/ 10 at current state.",25.7
"so far so good! im running win8.1, a 4790k, sli gtx 780s, and 16gb of ram. the game is installed on a 7200rpm hdd. i realize some people are having technical issues, and i understand that can be very frustrating, but trust me when i say its worth it. these are probably some of the nicest lighting effects ive seen in a game. i have every setting maxed out, except for msaa, txaa, and the high detail shadows. my vram is my bottleneck unfortunately, so adding any of those options puts me into the 30-40fps region. i am running the game at 1440p so this is a pretty demanding setup. in the city im sitting in the 60-80fps region and in the country areas its 40-50fps or so. i do notice that when driving very fast across the map i hit moments of 30fps, and im not sure if this is because of the game loading the next section of the map or if its because my settings are too high (theres a ton of vegetation in the country areas) so one way or the other ill even out some settings to get 60+fps constant if possible. as for the story and gameplay, its gta. i played through the entire game on the xb360 version so i have less motivation to play the main story currently, but i assume its basically just the same, and the main story was awesome on xb360 so i cant see why it wouldnt be just as good here. one thing i really noticed is that the cutscenes are actually enjoyable to watch now. the console cutscenes ran so slow and choppy it was hard to even pay attention to the story, but so long as your settings are done correctly they will run at a nice 60hz+ and it becomes much easier to get sucked into the story. just understand what youre buying. its still gta, just like the console version, but with a lot of great new visuals and online features. if youre looking for a game to really tax your system this is it!",13.2
"this game was really fun on xbox and im sure its even more fun on pc and id live to play if it wasnt for the fact that i cant stay in game for more then 15 minutes. they game crashes way too much for what it is, its benn delayed and has a large team that should know what they are doing. ive looked everywhere and i cant find one solution that works or anything from rockstar saying they are working on it or even that they know that the game is crashing for so many people. i payed for a game this big it shouldnt be crashing this much. ive seen early access games made by a single person that crash less then this.",64.2

"the definitive gta:v experience which, for me, was the ultimate multi-player game of the last generation. granted, its been a bit of a wait for the pc crowd, and the online facet of the game is not without its glitches (abominable lag despite having a +100 mbps connection, jumping into a car and not being able to drive for some reason, weird vehicle damage modelling loops, just-killed enemies coming back to life due to disparity between local and server-side assets, etc.), but when you compare it to similar games in the genre, i still think its way ahead of the competition. yes, the delays should have meant a more stable launch, and i agree that the whole windows username thing, whilst not affecting me personally, is a pretty big oversight, but a quick patch or two later and it should all be rectified. then again, im one of the jerks whos been playing it on xb360 and ps4 for the last year and a half, so im probably a whole lot more forgiving than the average pc user. either way, its a 09/10 from me - now we just gotta wait for a pc remake/sequel to red dead redemption.",19.5

"this game is really good. i bought it back on ps3 when it first came out, and immediatly couldnt let go. while its true i have other games that maybe i like more inherently, such as half life or naissancee, grand theft auto v probably is going to become my most played game very quickly, simply because theres so much to do in it. even once youve compleated the story campaign, and every single player mission, (an unrealistically gargantuan task by the way) there is still gta online. if you somehow manage to finish that, (which because of the user created content, i dont think that can even be done) the huge open world still gives plenty of opportunities to screw around and have fun. i have seen better stories in games, but i was still thoroughly entertained by that of gta. the main story is extremely enjoyable, and almost all the side missions bode well into the open world, and dont feel tacked on. as for optimization, the game runs fabulously on my old laptop on the medium settings, something that left me totally dumbfounded. i have heard people are having issues with getting the game to run, i never had anything like this, but judging by the other reviews, i would say you should look into these issues before you purchase. all in all, this game is absolutly amazing, and totally worth buying, even if youve already bought and beat the last gen versions. if you already have the current gen, maybe hold of till a sale though.",18.8

"characters lacking charisma, repetitive missions and some repulsive scenes. ive played gta since the third one, never found myself getting bored until gta v. 3/4 of the game is trevor whining about what michael did, getting ready for a heist or solving the dumb troubles your family gets into. except for a couple of missions there was no adrenaline; there are some scenes where i feel rockstar crossed a line as well. there was gore when it clearly could have been avoided, gta doesnt need that. i insist, you guys crossed a line with this game, an akward one.",25.6

"since im not an idiot, im not going to give this a bad review just because i had trouble playing it as soon as it launched. the actual game itself is great. it looks nice, sounds nice, and plays well. definitely worth the wait. i definitely like the extra customization options for gta online characters. p.s. dont trust negative reviews that complain about it not working the second it was released. babies shouldnt even be allowed to right reviews.",16.4
"i played the ps3 version a lot. 30 hours on campaign, and 220 hours online. on pc it feels like everything i know and love about the game, except better. it had a rough start but now it is running fairly smooth, and most of the negative reviews are from people complaining that it didnt launch right away. shout out to rockstar for a getting a fix soon enough and finally doing your amazing game justice!",26.0

"having already played through gta 5 on xbox 360 i was excited to be able to play it on pc. while normally a pc only gamer, i do love the gta series so i picked it up when there was no pc release date announced yet. i played it pretty thorougly on 360 (completed main story and got to about 80% total completion) and then played to around 46 for gta online. i must say that i did have some concerns with it coming to pc but with how they treated the release on 360 and fixed the early online issues with monetary compensation i felt as if i could trust rockstar to fix any issues that would come up so i preordered it for pc. so far i have to say that the pc version is the best version of the game by far. it has very little graphical pop in (with none on anything solid so far which is nice), this has always been an issue in gta games and i have to say this version of 5 has the least out of any in the series ive ever played. i have had very few issues and the ones i have are understandable, small bugs that will be sorted out but are very far from gamebreaking. that being said id be lying if i said i can say the same for everyone i know with the game. i do have 2 friends (out of about 9 with the game) who have had issues with either installing the game or with it crashing during gameplay. im not sure of their exact specs on their system but i know they both play plenty of other intensive games on their pcs with no issues so im leaving it on the game more than on them.",58.3

"i see all these great reviews of this game, and what i have been able to play of it i really like, but thats where the good things end. for the most part, i have to sit here and start and restart, start and restart just to get the game to work, and in the rare times that it does work, it only works for a short amount of time, so with that said i cant play it until they come up with a fix for what is wrong with it, and thats 60 bucks wasted. so in light of the fact that i cant play i cant recommend until rockstar fixes the crap thats wrong with it.",8.5

"great game, saw 2 dogs having intercourse. online experience is great, i never played it on playstation nor xbox, so i cant really say anything about that. the game, for me, started great after installation, no problems there, except i had to use an old account ( that i thought i never had to use again) named juicychristian, the name speaks for itself. but i got a namechange so no biggie. the only problem ive really encountered, is abit of online lag, players sometime freezes and teleporting. anyhow, great game, lots of fun to do, and also lots of transsexual-looking strippers ;s 11/10 would play again.",56.8

"after two years, the blockbusting grand theft auto v has finally arrived on pc. and now the question im sure everyone is asking: is it worth a buy? i can safely say this is one of the best optimizations of a pc game i have seen. even a gtx 860m, a the midrange laptop gpu in my comp, is able to churn up 60fps on high settings with little to no hitches. kudos to r* for delivering a fantastic product. note: now while the game itself runs beautifully, the installation issues were a royal pain. if steam ever crashes during the unpacking, or the social club client is unable to start the game: grand theft auto v has exited unexpectedly verify the game cache, it turned out that 10 files were missing so let that unpack. other than that great port 10/10",55.9

"so many unpleasant things in the installion of pc version. i am not an native english speaker, but i still pose this to let more people know something serious about gta5. thats what happened to me. 1. pre-load succefully 2. cannot dispatch because it needs unbelieveable space disk of 120gb to dispatch, when it only mentions about 66gb will be needed for this game 3. pc crashed, have to shut down and reboot, this process repeated 5 or more times on me 4. delete the local file of gta5 and try to manage some disk space for it 5. re-download 6. install, no response 7. google what is happening. 8. try to install social club manually = doent work 9. try to update my nvidia sofeware = doent work 10. finally fount out there are problems with mobile nvidia cards, i have to turn off the driver when i want to open the launcher correctly (wtf) 11. now it says soemthing about you cant play because your pc is not available (i am quite sure my pc can run gta5 in low quility), you can try soemthing so called safe mode? not quite sure about the exact name because i didnt use the english version. 12. go to the support page of rockstar games, i cant find the soultion, cant pose the question in the forum because my account of social club is new, cant even submit a question ticket to rockstar. more than 10 hours past, but i still cannot play it. totally time-wasting. seriously speaking, why i pay money for this sh*t ? i never write such a long review because the most games i played are awesome, i dont think they need my review to prove their are high-leveled. rockstar, fix the problems asap, for f**king sake !",29.4

"ok, first, i have to say: why dont you already have this game? and secondly, if you do own the game and are just reading the reviews for chuckles, hello! the silly review (since this game deserves it): upon playing the first time, i was pulled over by a police officer in the small truck-stop town of paleto bay, while driving a rusty tractor down the interstate. probably for going too slow on my journey back to los santos and holding many a semi truck back. then, while waiting for the officer to come around to me, i see his car and him scooting by, being rammed by a small pickup. the pickup was then blown up by a sniper team in a helicopter, for assaulting an officer. continued to los santos on my tractor without further interruption. the serious review: uhhh... later. ive, uhm, still gotta finish the game. pc forever!",65.5

"i got it because a friend has been going on and on about it, but i should have waited for a steam sale. controls are bad for keyboard and mouse. first person mode made me think it would be like a propper fps but it is not even close, like very bad. the ui is clunky. the story is average gta stuff so far. graphics are good for a sandbox game. i have not tried multiplayer so can not comment on that. online acount is bs. imho this game was totally over-hyped.",6.9
"very impressed. while i was not able to run the game at max settings, i was able to maximize the graphics to a point where they still exceed the graphics seen in the current generation consoles like the ps4. i am running an aging amd phenom ii x6 1100t (turbo core/coolnquiet disabled), 16gb of ddr3, and 2 asus gtx 760s in sli (4gb vram total)with the latest nvidia gta v approved drivers what i was impressed with the most is that the fact that this runs better than gtaiv... on the same hardware! rockstar did not screw this up, and has redeemed itself from that awful port that was gta iv. while it is disappointing to hear that many people with odd windows account names were unable to install and run the game, i feel as though a bug as that should not eclipse what a great game this turned out to be. graphics aside (but seriously... wow!) the game itself has not lost any of its luster gameplay-wise in the 2 years its been out. gta games just never get old. the game will have you hooked, its got me hooked on my third playthrough, and with mod support, expect the game to be even better than the console experience.",5.7

(*points* talking to you rockster!) with some minor tweaks, this game could be epic. i look forward to the expansion of the gta v mod community, because ever since gta iv, they have been waiting to mod a game of this magnitude. things that would make this game perfect! *manual transmission option *fuel system *working mirrors on cars (rearview and sidemirrors)",52.4

(1) the game actually has a fairly interesting story. i find myself not skipping the cut scenes for the most part. (2) being able to switch between characters is really cool. (3) fps!! first person mode is really cool. i like being able to switch when i want (4) graphics. wow! the game looks so pretty on my 5820k/gtx980 combo. (5) smooth. the game feels so smooth at release -unlike watchdogs which is still a buggy mess. (6) the game will still provide hours of entertainment even after you finish it. conclusion. it was worth the wait. but, with all of the money they have made, they better hire some more people so that gta vi gets released on all platforms at the same time, like every other normal company does.",36.9

"works flawlessly for me, amazing optimization even on my outdated hardware. i can run the game fine and it looks reasonably well on my customized settings (textures average, shaders and shadows high. cpu-related options are varied. draw distances maxed.) runs anywhere from 30-60fps with vsync on, and incredibly rarely drops below 30. my cpu is a amd phenom ii x4 955 and my gpu is an gtx 480, so you can see i dont have the best computer for todays games. one of my buddies is having rendering issues and another linked his account incorrectly like a  so do be wary. there are some loops you have to jump through but after that its smooth sailing. theres issues that rockstar knows about, though its very likely thisll be remedied during launch week. the port seems to be very well done, some controls seem wonky but it will just take some getting used to. the population density doesnt seem to have changed much, 4 or 5 additional people on small streets but nothing like the images on the store page. car density is better, its not doubled or anything if thats what you were wondering. there are some very low quality textures even on maxed out settings for some reason aswell, though you will only notice it if youre looking directly at it. overall its very enjoyable for me, online is a bit finicky but i expected that. be careful with a few settings as they will literally drop your framerate in half, such as the advanced video settings. i would recommend the game but you may or may not want to wait a week or so for the first patches. if you can wait do it but you dont need to, it should be fine. port is very very solid.",52.2

"pros -graphicly excellent -fps mode adds alot to the game -for the most part good port -seemless use of controller and keyboard/mouse -director mode is a feature that will add lots of replay value cons -a few peopke having loading people (most people have no problems just a vocal minority) -a few fps issues when on full greaphics even with high end cards -minor camera control issues in fps (but that could me being an ) tl:dr - great port (if it loads) highly recomend but turn down shaddows a little. the fps mode adds a great new perspective that works perfectly with keyboard and mouse, but have a controller ready for driving. for me this game works a treat. i have played the 360 version and this is deffinatly just as fun. the use of first person mode makes the game epic. gun fights are better and more seamless with the ability to aim now a thing. i personalynuse a 360 controller and keyboard and mouse somi get the best of both worlds and i would recomend this. im using a nvidia 970 and the game is on near full graphics and well my fps is somewhere between 25-45 fps which would imply the game has a little work to do in regards to graphical bugs. yes it looks tones better than 360 but not that much better, i dread to see what 4k monitors look like in regards to full graphics. so i hope an update comes out to improve this. either way the game looks good and super high quality shaddows are not hugely necessary, and turning them down a little improves the frame rate alot. for those who have been having issues loading, that gota suck and there is little i can say about that but it works well for me first time so i have to highly recomend this game and while it is technicaly a port its a fairly good one and think its worth all the money.",68.4

"i have play this game for over a year on the xbox 360, not once did i complain about the heist, the lack of vehicles, lack of missions, and etc. i didnt care about all that. i cared more about the experience. my friends and i doing dumb sh** in gta online. first of all the single player aspect of the game is great. it doesnt follow gta 4s mistake of repeating the same type of missions (ex. follow target, kill target, go to place to kill target, etc.), each mission in gta 5 feels unique, especially since switching character was a thing, and makes every mission unique and diverse, and how rockstargames used this aspect was very well executed, and it made sense in the missions. for gta online, i really enjoyed what i had played on my last-gen xbox 360, the experience of an open sandbox game and with your friends. planning epic planes and gettaway cars because my friends and i were going to rob a convinience store?? that sounds stupid! and it was, but that was the whole point of gta online, having fun in anyway possible, especially with your friends. gta online isnt ment to be played alone, i recommend you bring a friend with you, if you dont have any friends, then make some friends!!!! everything i have explained about gta online was on last-gen, i cant begin to explain how much the pc version captures everything that i loved and gives me more. a more rich and visual improvement over the last-gen console. personally i dont see a huge difference between the current-gen consoles and the pc, nor does it matter, what matters is that everyone who has been waiting for this on the pc may now get to enjoy one of the greatest open-world sandbox games on the pc. gta 5 and online = 10/10",51.4

"gta 5 as an exercise in world building and story is amazing, the world feels alive, deep and most importantly fun. the 3 main characters are varied enough to keep things from becoming stale, and being able to specialize them, through semi rpg elements and purchases is a nice touch. as far as gameplay related bugs go i encountered just one in 12 hours (unable to progress through mission). however the game makes us of often auto saves and allows quick saving so this was not a massive issue due to being able to load previous save. in terms of a the quality of the pc port i have several woes, firstly installing on a samsung ssd caused memory issues and made the game unplayable, secondly crossfire scaling is not as good as i hoped. despite this a great set of graphical options offered allowing intricate customization. overall very happy with the game",24.6

"at first i was very sceptical, especially because i have seen the flaws of this game on the xbox 360. the issue with that game on that console, was that you could glitch your money in many different ways by using 2 online players, and the pay & spray shop. you could also gate glitch, and get underneath the red parking lot building, and if you had a fast enough car, you could even make a jump towards the metro, underneath los santos. most of these glitches i have tested if they still work, and from what i have gathered and tried, its 9/10 made impossible. along with the graphical update, the first person view, and for how you can transfer your gta console character to the pc makes everything just perfect as it should. i espect many hours that i will spend inside this game, all under the form of total freedom that we all care so much about. the only thing i really dislike about gta, is that they have taken so much time, untill the pc port was finally there.. for future games, this should really be quicker, prostponing will make gamers angry, and nothing positive comes out from that. i give this game a 9/10.",66.9

"i remember the day when my friends told me id never experience gta 5 on the pc when it first released, i kept my comments to myself, knowing that when gta iv released it took them 9 months for it to come over to the pc. 2 years later i pre-odered the game, hoping and praying this game wouldnt turn out terrible....and to my surprises, with some of the launch problems, and rubber banding during online play, rockstar really did make this game one of my favorite games of all times. it runs flawless on my gaming pc, it isnt a beastly rig, has medium specs to it, but damn even with all my graphics set to normal/high, the game runs 40-50 fps in cities, and over 60 in the mountains and blaine county. online is funny as hell, playing with friends is amazing, running from the cops, to holding up store clerks for money, to heists, they really have made the best version of gta 5 possible. if you already havent purchased this game, open your wallets and buy it now. if you asked for a refund, buy the game again. this is the best game of the year for me, and i will be playing it years from now with friends, and i promise you its worth every minute, hour, and dime you put into it.",57.8
"if you have a low spec comp. good luck searching for satisfication in this game :d",45.1
"3 years ago, gta v came out on console and i was sure ill never get to play it as im a pc player exclusively. when it was announced on pc and next gen, i told myself that a simple port of the game was coming, like many other games, and that pc players will be once again treated like something that dont matter with minimal options and improvement. how wrong i was. the amount of work that have been put in this release is phenomenal. the optimization seems top notch, and even the next gen console version looks bad versus the 4k beefed version. im not playing in 4k, few people can, but i have enough horsepower on my rig to play it on ultra 1080p and i have to say that its amazing. mouse & keyboard controls are good (mostly for shooting!) but are a little clumsy in vehicle phases. good thing i have an old x360 pad at hand. technically speaking, i dont know what to say. im speechless. theres so much graphical option than even the best pc games pales compared to this. for once, we have a true pc version, and not a quick cheap port with few to none options for us pc master race overlords who loves tweaking everything =d i have only played 2 hours, but i can already say that i dont regret one bit to have paid full price for this game. and considering how much copies have sold already, i hope more editors will be willing to make true pc version of their games in the future, seeing the huge potential it represent.",26.8
"its home.",57.6
"this game is great! i played it on the 360 when it first came out and i have to say that getting it again on the pc was a great choice. the game has really improved from the 360 version. it looks beautiful with max setting. i get about 45 to 50fps on max settings (check out my profile for all my pc info) which is still better than the 360. first person mode is really cool and the scenery is awesome. also something that i liked is they put in even more good songs into the radio stations, los stantos rock radio is the best haha. last but not least, hiests! if you are on the fence about getting this game id say go for it even if you have played it before like me on the ps3 or 360, its so much better on the pc.",31.1

"all i can say is this game is 50x better than it was on the xbox 360. the nightlife in the game looks amazing with all the reflections etc....the detailing now is alot better aswell ! i reccomend this game to anyone looking to have a chilled time with friends driving and runnning around causing havok in the city of los santos :)",28.7
"a nearly perfect pc version, runs like a dream almost completely maxed out at 1080p with my gtx 970. almost every option you can think of can be configured, even keyboard lighting effects if you have an rgb keyboard like the orion spark. the only omission i can think of is that, despite the ability to do so for the right stick, you cannot configure deadzones for the left stick. this isnt a problem when using a gamepad, but i had been hoping to use my xbox wireless racing wheel in first person, and its difficult to use when youre stuck with a ~15% deadzone. i think theres one for the throttle axis, too, but its much less noticeable.",100.7
"more than 12 hrs after launch and it isnt working for moest people is abit of a joke. but when i got it working its an awesome game so i guess i would give it a like 8/10",31.2
"well, i am actually very hyped for this game but when it first released there is a lot of crashes and settings that i need to deal with. im using lenovo y510p, for laptop users there is a lot of trouble going through to play this game. a lot of contant crashes god knows where it came from but after everything i am still giving the positive review for all the awesome gameplay i had. i did had bad moments starting the game but after playing it, every minute of it is worth while. ps: i dont recommend laptop users to purchase first, wait till they fix this thing.",50.4

"rough launch, with the size being so darn big, and the install taking so long, for so many to have issues starting the game is disappointing. that said, i played this game on the ps3, actually bought a ps3 for this and red dead. i was shocked and amazed at how awesome this game was on the ps3. it looked great, ran great and once the initial online kinks were worked out it was a blast to play online also. i was excited to try the pc version because i love my pc way more than any console, and i was super excited when they decided to release it for this platform. i had one problem after the preload, i had freed up about 90 gigs for the install of this game but it ended up using almost 120 during the preload to install process, effectively screwing up the install for lack of space. either way i got it working and since then it has run flawlessly. as soon as i started this game i had a bit of a shock, it felt like a whole new game. this game looks so good, runs so smoothly, online works well, load times are fast, and really it blew me away with how it all felt. i do have a couple of issues as of right now, first, i was really hoping for animals to hunt in online. something ive wanted to do for a long time, it could be added to this version no doubt, i just hope they do. second, they need to work on keeping friends in servers together, we had the problem of friends being switched to another server while we were in the same cars and playing together in free mode. third, they need to have an option to move the free camera while driving without it snapping back to the predetermined view. so in all, my complaints are very minor. this game is great and you wont regret buying it if you do.",25.3

"man, first person takes this game to another level. at first i thought it was poorly optimized, and have the rig to run it great. i soon learned all you have to do if you get stuttering, is alt+tab out and click icon back in. this has fixed all stuttering without lowering graphics options at all. gta v is a lot of fun, and was well worth the wait. 3 characters to control is a nice switch-up. good variation of missions. this game on pc looks way better, and runs smoother than the consoles. i would recommend this game to anyone who wants to take a hiatus from life for a bit heh heh. recommended!!",66.4
"love everything about this game! i remember playing gta2 and wondering how it would be in 3d. thought it was never possible. gta3 came out and proved to be everything and so much more. playing gta5 brings me back to the old days and pushes me forward into planning heists and fighting mind controlling aliens. loving every bit of it. thankyou rockstar!",29.4

"if you have an ssd and meet the system requirements then i would suggest this game highly. it runs like a beut on my 780 ti. this game is no port mind you, there are so many new things ive seen within the world from the consoles that it blows me away. even if you havent played the earlier gta games you will still love this immersive experience that it provides.",72.9

"ive played it on both consoles, and now on pc. to me, this game just keeps on being fun and the graphical improvements on pc are pretty stunning! if you havent played this on consoles, this is definitely a must-have and totally worth the money.",23.6

"for those who have a problem with unpacking. in my case i have a 120 gb ssd... (formatted, no os) that not enough for this game unpacking. first, let it unpack until it pop up and error. then looking for an unpacked file in download folder. select some unpacked files and move it to another drive (in my case im moving sfx folder that worth around 16 gb) when it moved, try unpacking again. it will begin on where your left off. when unpacking finished it will back to 60 something gb. move folder back to common/[game folder]/[wherever it will be in the first place] this will be a little tricky cause it may not in a same position before you move it from download folder. doing file check... let it download if necessary. work and play! : ) *if you have more space please do some backup before, just for sure. for a game and 10 minutes in it... 20/10 : )",84.6
"holy  this game runs smooth and the graphics are amazing!",53.8
"ok if you have the gta launcher issue go on device managers, display adapters and disable your video card then it should run then enable the next time you start the game. now for the review its worth every penny. the gameplay is smooth, the game is great looking, havent tried online but ive heard very positive stuff about it and the game is just simply very very fun. if your pc can run this is a must buy",84.7
"this game is truly a masterpiece, one of my most favourite games of all time. buy it. now.",49.1
"just excellent! i didnt suppose that this game will run on my pc, because it is a normal thing nowadays when minimum requirements for the game are just meaningless - there is a very little chance that it will at least launch. however, i was very impressed when i saw a nice optimization - stable 30-50 fps in fact, that every spec of my pc is just as the same as the minimum requirement (i5-2320 3.0 ghz, gtx 550ti, 4 gb ram). the game itself is the best thing ever done for the whole gaming industry - not more not less. rockstar did its job well. 10/10.",39.9
"+ im surprised how well this game runs on very high settings, single player and multiplayer. (gtx 670 overclocked) + lots of graphic setting options. + new soundtrack + hasnt crashed once + day one multiplayer is working + first person view is great - flying controls are little weird (maybe because i havent played gta on pc before)",9.6

"so imagine gta v on 360/ps3 was like the meal youve waited for all your life that tasted a little raw, but it was a good meal, yknow? then, youve got the ps4/one version that is the same meal cooked ever so slightly better, yet youre still hungry. this version is like, the real deal. the main entre. the dish youve been truly hungry for your whole life. and it may have taken a little longer for it to be done but you craved it even more. in the end, this is the most delicious meal of your life. you get everything and more, especially for those who can crank up to 11 (4k resolution, baby) even if youve bought this game before and thought youve done it all, dont overlook this well optimized glorious experience that will make your return to los santos ever so sweeter.",25.2
"gta v is finally released on pc, with much improvement from the previous gta iv release. it runs smooth 40-60fps even on my old hd6850. the same reaction when max payne 3 was released, why is this running smoothly on my old graphic card? rockstar has done a really good job on this. but still, 4 months of delay is pretty painful to wait.",45.9
"a new and fresh experience with gta v with update graphics and all the other content arrived in one big bundle. no need to wait for gta online, no need to wait for hesists, all the things that were on the console is on pc as well. sure, it took a couple years for it to be released, but hey, at least they released it. optimization is pretty good from the system requirements, but with my 970 graphics card, everything on max still had some jumps on the fps. nothing too major, and nothing a couple of patches cant fix. overall, this game looks amazing, and if anybody has played on last generation console like me, you would appreciate the mesmerizing graphics.",20.3

"after about 3 hours of playing i can definitely recommend this game to anyone. it has been a long wait but this game is worth the money. one of the best additions to the pc version is the director mode and the 60fps boost. director mode will be a unique tool to use once everyone gets the hang of it but it is still really cool. playing with a mouse and keyboard seems a little awkward at first but you can get used to it. i personally feel like after playing this game that this game was made for pc as it is extremely superior to every other version. so finally i give a rating of 8/8 buy dis game yo.",47.7
"well the wait is finally over pc users, after being treated like second class citizens gta v fianlly came out. this is a franchise that you either love or hate, nothing here reinvents the wheel but this game is absolutely stunning and as fun as any of the other gta titles. a plus for me was a channel playing old punk rock with keith morris (black flag,circle jerks/off!) as the dj solid game woth the purchase, i just wish the wait for release was not so damn long.",8.3

"the absolute best of what gaming has to offer. rockstar has outdone themselves on this one. this is the very definition of how optimizing a game properly will directly relate to increased sales and a companys reputation. kudos, kudos, kudos rockstar. thank you for not rushing an unfinished product to us, thanks you for the delays, most definitly worth the wait. game publishers take note, it is worth the freaking money and time to optimize your games before launch. rockstar has proven yet again what is possible in the realm that is gaming. i am running an old i7 860, gtx 660ti, 8g ddr3 ram, and a crappy 5200 rpm hard drive, and i am able to play the game very comfortably at a higher resolution than 1080p. this is why i dont mind delays on highly anticipated titles, this is why i have bought the game twice, this is why i will not purchase anything from ubisoft ever again. this isnt just a game release, it is a revolution. a declaration of war to all those greedy companies who think we the gamers are saps to be milked for every last dime, no matter the quality of the product. this is why rockstar deserves their billions, and an apology from all you trolls who were hating because they refused to release an inferior product, and update it later.",53.2

"played the game for a day now, did a few missions, drove and messed around a bit. i was loving gta 3, was seriously hyping on vice city (cause i love the era), havent played san andreas at all (computer not powerfull enough at the time) and was okay with gta 4. so far i am having a blast. the performance is great, even on my sub-par computer. it even manages to look good on lowest settings (which are called normal instead of low or some such thing, nice touch!). its the first full priced game i have bought in a long time, and i am pretty sure i wont regret it. full recommendation for fans of the genre! there are a few glitches, like massive fps drop now and again for a second or four, but its manageable and it never happened in a mission so far. some cutscenes were a bit off sync. have to stop writing now and resume playng ;)",31.0
"i load it up and then my social club crashes...fix please",5.6
"as soon as i got in game i set everything to lowest details to simulate the feeling of going from ps3 to pc when i changed the graphics to high. to my dismay the game looked better on all low graphics than the ps3 and i was robbed of my experience. worse than that i was given 1.5 million dollars and my old character from the console version and the ability to earn and claw my way to the top was brutally stripped from me. the first person mode is so emersive that flying makes me sick, the ability to record is taking up space on my hard drive, and dont even get me started on my infuriating and uncanny ability to aim with precision now that i can use mouse and keyboard. its made the game far to convenient. 10/10 would waste 2 years of my life and drain my daughters college fund again.",64.3
"played gta v just thought a quick review on graphics and playability have been waiting for this game and preoredered it i am not dissapointed the game runs smooth havent encountered any difficulties in playing the game this is my data if it helps alienware 51 r2 gpu- geforce gtx 745 cpu- intel(r) core(tm) i5-4460 cpu@ 3.20ghz memory 8gb 7.92 usable hardrive 1tb installed the updated driver from nividea gforce released for grand theft auto v operating system- windows 8.1 frames rates are stable no massive spikes in difference, have to say first person mode adds much to the world level of this games quality and gameply cannot be disputed seems highly polished. have played this on ps3 and can definately tell the differnence. account issues with rockstars social club seem to be apparent you must create a social club account its just a peice of bloated drm software designed to look cool and interesting reccomend you go to rockstars web page and create an account before loading gta v same goes if you have forgotten your password because you havent used it in years, to avoid any issues. it links to your steam account so you can only have one rockstar club account and its permanent no going back so as i said if you create an account before hand you can forget about it after the drm stage from rockstar. personally i think steam needs to ban these practices in future third party drm has a lot of issues. thankfully have had no issues with this created account months ago with another game forgot the password through. one thing you can count on is rockstar patching anything this game needs so dont give up if you cant play i know its frusrating through have games in my libary like that unplayable becasue of a silly issue, this is there pilot into pc gaming they,ve learned the mistakes of the past and have built a lot of new systems so the game can run on medium to high poewered pcs not just released a port this is a game version in its own right this wouldnt run on consoled well anymore. right lets play gta time to enjioy myself after all the waiting glad you did rockstar",20.3

"good game, worth buy",32.7
"great game, weve all played it. i will reccomend with a few caveats: i pre-loaded, but oh, whats this? another 40 minute download (still not sure what it was) was required before i could play. good thing i have plenty of distractions. first time running - started windowed, behind the start panel, could not make a selection. had to force close to get it to work. nag screen came up - thanks? i set up fullscreen mode. when i went to play again, back to windowed? can we keep the settings we choose please? i should not have to select fullscreen every time. setting up a game every time really bogs the experience down. i admit it, i have adhd. if im in game mode, i want to play. i dont want to tinker with settings. i started a benchmark test to get the best settings. walked away, and then - mission failed? this is a mission? i never said to start playing, i said i wanted a benchmark for the best settings. i didnt want to play until my settings were just right. other than these little quirks the game plays great. first person mode is a little gimmicky. im sure others like it but driving in fp is really really difficult. the added ability to take videos is pretty sweet. and the graphics are gorgeous. much improved from the only version i played before, xbox 360. ill take pc anyday, even with the wait. all in all, seems worth the wait, and worth the delays.",11.4

"just... just buy it, trust me. this is not just a port, this is more. the game is beautiful and the hype is not fake. you must know one thing - 2gb graphics card, is enough, now let me define enough: some features (graphical ones ofc) require a lot of graphics cards memory, and for beautiful game, without huge fps drops, crashing, etc. you will need more than 2gb :) every penny that you give in this game, if worth it!",71.6
"been stucked in the game luncher loading process for literally an hour and nothing happened. i tried to restart steam, change compatibility, restart computer and basically anything i could think of, but still couldnt solve the problem. im quite disappointed by this weird bug, i dont care about in-game bugs because i know its not easy to solve every single one of them at launch, but i think players should at least be able to play the game, right?",36.3

"my review is more of a comparision between my take on the ps3 vs pc versions. i personally love this game and feel they did a great job improving on everything that made gta4 not so great. so i started with the ps3 version sence release and going from that to this is breathtaking, unbelevable, and just plain awsome! so the possitive +way better graphics compared to this first counsole ports like the ps3 (unsure how it looks on ps4/xb1 but im sure those arr not on high settings ether) +first person mode! +your own personal custom radio station (nothing like blasting metal killing gang bangers!) +far better framerate than counsoles (my ps3 looked capped at ~30fps?) +keeping your gta online progress and getting that preorder money added to that account! negative (very hard to find much) -driving in 1st person is a little crazy, maybe if they add oculus rift support this will be a possitive ;) -obveous few glictches and bugs but its all minor stuff that will probably get fixed asap so as you can tell there is basiclly nothing negative over this massive overhaul of the game. and yes it was worth every penny of that $60.... so yea you can say i paid $120 for this game but it is what it is. and with how amazing this is it feels like a whole new game.",8.8

"10/10 this game is amazing, this pc port is worth every penny i spend on it. i see a lot of negative reviews here and i really dont get why. the performance is amazing, it runs many times better then gta4 did and it looks astonishing. after playing only a few hours i must admit that rocktstar did a really good job, on the graphics and the optimization. it may have been delayed a couple of times, the end result is worth all the waiting. sure there are a couple of people with problems performance wise and the online servers are crowded right now, but this will all pass in the coming weeks. you know the story, the gameplay etc. but most people want to know how this game runs on the pc, and so far it runs excellent, better then any tripple a title i have seen in the last couple of months. i could write a long story on how amazing this game is but i really want to play more at this point:) thank you rockstar for making this game the experience i could have only dreamed for on the pc. maybe at some point in the future i will include more info here, for now all i can say is: i recommend this game more then most other games for this price tag, you are missing out on a amazing adventure otherwise.",53.1

"this game had a few release day hiccups, but no where near as many as some games. the hiccups included some unpacking errors and some other bugs involving rockstars social club, however these are easily fixed or you just have to wait a ad longer to play the game. my initial impressions were; the graphics are amazing, lots of customizable options (key bindings, graphical settings ect), the game runs at a butery smooth 60 fps (even on a pentum cpu and a gtx 760 ftw) at mostly high - maximum settings. however i have experienced a few bugs, which prevented my car from moving, however this is the only bug i have encountered. pros; 1) graphics 2)runs on not to good hardware very well 3)60 fps 4)key bindings and lots of customization 5)high resolution and multi monitor support (4k - 3 monitors) cons; 1)release day hiccups (not a big deal) 2)a few bugs (not many though) so all in all this game is brilliant on the pc, i love it more than ever now and it looks amazing.",9.9

"grand theft auto 5/v. this game had amazing hype, and a lot of high hopes. do i enjoy it, eh..... you see i had originally got it on the playstation 4, it was really fun good story no bugs whatsoever (no game breaking bugs at least) however, grand theft auto 5/v for pc is having a lot of issues..... lets go through the pros, and cons of this game. first we can start with the bad stuff.... cons game continuisly freezes and lags(not due to heat i have a water cooler) game sometimes doesnt follow my commands, i hit w to walk, he goes sideways. i try to stop running, he keeps running and right into the police officer where he dies. franky just crouch it! game requires you to disable gpu when hitting start, and then enabling it before the games starts so it isnt running with integrated card. no matter how amazing your gpu is. if you play for almost 3 hours straight it will start having terrible errible lag and not stop. also the game is having some startup issues that they had over 2 years to work on, should this have been released no! should people have been more pateiesnt, yes. pros-no game is perfect but every game has its up sides, as well as the downsides. the game is beautifully animated, and the graphics are pretty great. the game has a very nice well thought out story with amazing characters, whether it be terrifying trevor, or depressed michael, its still a great game. they added more cars! with teh addition to new cars, this game is even better than ever. the new director mode, and movie maker is pretty amazing and user friendly. takes some time getting used to, but its still very well addition to the game. the run down, yes grand theft auto is a great game, it was just rushed. and the fact that they had 2 years to make an un startable game is pretty dissapointing.... also i never got my pre-order bonus........",2.8

"leave it to rockstar to charge $60 for a 60gb game that crashes 60 seconds into the story mode every time! well done!",1.6
"crashes, crashes, crashes, crashes and oh; even more crashes and rockstar arent doing anything to help me out trying to fix this at all... ive sent in a support ticker - got a response about the console version... totally makes a lot of sense, right? error: launcher_err_invalid_outfile within 20 minutes of launching the game i get the following pop up crash window grand thef auto v has stopped working not the launcher!!!",16.8
"crashes for no reason. im not the only one with these issues, a friend of mine couldnt even start the game. downloaded drivers specificly made for this game and obviously they didnt chance anything about the game chrases. for the amount of money that you have to pay for a game that crashes or (for some) dosnt even start isnt even worth it. gameplay, multiplayer. the game (exept for the obvious programming issues) is fun to play. though it can get repetetiv really fast but you can still have some fun if not alot of it if you get lucky and can play the game. there is alot of small things you can do like training among other things. you can even do jobs like robbing a target or stealing something like a car or other things but those jobs are handed to you at random and you can go for a longer period of time not able to do anything but wait for them to come in. to be able to do heists you need to be atleast level 12 or higher and i had some difficulties to get to that level (can be my retardness) because of the lack of things to grind. another downside is that things are overcomplicated, finding jobs for and then manage to get the group together into that level can be a real pain in the . + if you get a so called job its random if you get to even be the host. another thing its a small thing but still if /when you wanna get a apartment you cant preview it (from the inside) which i think would be given but still so when you find a apartment you will have to spend that half a million in just faith that it turns out into a good apartment. settings. i miss some of settings also, for example you cant chance voice chat settings for yourself so when you use your mick you cant (for example) set it so only people close by or people in your crew can only hear you. it (what i can find) is always set so you speak to everyone on the server. atm i would give the game a 6/10 mostly because of the crashes and , if i ignore those issues i would probably give it a 7.5/ 10 at current state.",25.7
"congrats for making a game that does not even start! way to take money from us. its fun seeing a $60 game in my library that i cant even play!",21.6
"so, after playing all through the story and a little bit online. i can safely say this is the best pc verison of gta v. it was worth the delays imo. -pros graphics are wonderful performance pretty well on a gtx 980 never had any slowdowns or stutter moddable cars both online and story the writing for this was amazing and i find it odd i would like the crazy pyscho from shady shores. :d first person mode was done well and i ended up playing it more in that perspective then third person view. mods the pc options are very extensive and settings that i havent seen for a long while. a lot of caring was put into this and its not a port as it was developed from start to finish for the pc. extensive radio stations and amazing score from the rockstar crew. i ended up turning off the radio more just to listen to the score. -cons some people are having performance issues and some cant launch the game [please make sure your pc is up to spec and this requires 64 bit os, visit forums to ask for help and rockstar support] online can be a bit funky at times ( this was two days after release, so it should get better soon) -other there is a microtransaction system that does allow players to buy online cash for their character but i listed this in other because you still need to rank up in mutiplayer in order to access some of the cool cars, high end pads, weapons and etc. note: do not expect to play this on a below spec machine provided in the pc requirements and have everything maxed out. it isnt a super intesive game as -insert crysis joke-. but it still requires a bit of decent hardware.",109.6

"after reading all the negative reviews, i felt i should right my review and to be honest i dont know why this is getting so much hate.. people are giving the game negative reviews because it crashes right away, this sounds like a problem on there end and shouldnt be judging the game based on problems you are having.. i have zero problems with the game and it runs just fine! maybe im just lucky not sure and yet i will get a crash once in a blue moon but besides that everything works great and people giving negative reviews because they are having problems with the game is just wrong.. there is a hand-full of people that cant play but they should try and fix it and not hate on the game..",99.3

"the game itself is great. i expected to be able to at least run it on minimum settings and for the most part its reasonable. still looks better than console with shadows being the only issue. the glitches and speed of launch/ loading will probably be fixed soon. it does freeze up a bit luanching the game but i just get a snack and its loaded when i come back, probably 2 minutes at most. gameplay is fantastic, i love the story (never bothered getting it for console) and there are so many interesting things to do in the game world. if you are very impatient and expect a lot from your setup, maybe wait a few weeks for the glitches to pass. but if you can handle a bit of lag, a few glitches, and dont care too much about flawless performance, definitely buy this ultimate edition of gta 5",57.5

"so i just installed gta 5 to my laptop (ihave nvidia 870m), after i opened up the game the right bottom bubble said gta5.exe has been blocked from graphic hardware and the game stopped working. i opened geforce experience to look for an update or something, but the app said the driver was unknown, it couldnt find the driver. after i restarted my computer it gave a blue screen report that says video_tdr_failure (nvlddmkm.sys) and when i opened up geforce experience again it couldnt not find any hardware. i tried to install the driver again but the installation program couldnt find the hardware either. i believe the problem is the new release of gta 5. also my gpu tweak program says the laptop is currently using intel graphics. after all these happened i contacted you and you told me that you should contact with the manufacturer. and i did that too and got my geforce experience fixed. this time when i open up the game my laptop shutted itself down 3 times. then i optimized the game from geforce experience. then it gave the blue screen again and there is no hardware detected again. i can fix it again but i dont think i can play the game again to not get the same crash.",18.8

"heres my thoughts on the game (so far, as of 4/15/2015) (this review is targeted towards online more than single player) this game is fun to play with friends, or even by yourself. i especially enjoyed running around and doing heists with my friends and hunting down other players who have a bounty. i have quite a few problems with the game though.. -it took me a couple hours to fix all of the graphical issues and game errors, i had (and still have) troubles with the game suddenly going into windowed mode, or crashing during cutscenes. my question is, why did rockstar push the game multiple times and not test to see how to fix these bugs? -the controls are really bad. really, really bad. not just the gameplay controls, but also navigating menus and getting private matches/jobs/heists was a pain in the butt. this is probably my own personal problem, because i havent gotten acquainted with the controls. -(online) cutscenes during heists and jobs would crash my game, and the rewards would be given to my party members, and not me. even though many bugs lie within the walls of gta v, i would highly recommend this game. it is a fun experience to have when you are messing around with friends and messing around yourself in singleplayer. my final rating is 7.8/10; totally could have been better, could have been possibly worse.",37.2

"this is a monumental achievement in gaming. not only does it look like a brand new game, but it launched without a hitch. the industry needs to study under rockstars coders, because this game is so well optimized that it makes recent aaa releases look damn embarassing. this is without a doubt, one of the greatest games ever created. ______ gameplay + almost 100% a completely succesful port. + the mouse control for airplanes and helicopters is surprisingly succesful once you get used to it. + the first person view is also splendidly well integrated and fun to switch in and out of. - i still found myself wanting to play this with a gamepad, because it does have its spikes of difficulty where auto aim toggling/target toggling + modible cars and bikes. although i wish the default cars for each character were able to be changed. some aspects of the modibiltiy leave a little be desired and seem to be more cosmetic than functional. + character stats that improve with usage. always a + to have a little rpg element to an action game. - this causes me to drive motorcycles at top speeds againsts 3 lanes of highway traffic to level up driving. like trinity. graphics + amazingly gorgeous improvement from the ps3/xbox version. hd textures ftw. + features like nvidia txaa, pcss, ambient occlusion, depth of field are well implemented. + incredibly well coded and optimized to run well on high settings with an average machine. - no physx :(. then again, if taking apart a house bullet by bullet, shingle by shingle and plank by plank were possible in this game like the excellent mafia ii - i would probably never be able to tear myself from it. story + i never really thought much of gtas previous storys; but rockstar knocks it out of the park. with a capability to be both silly and crass, and still have you feel a connection to each of the 3 main guys. particularly with michael. + long game. love long storys. lots of character development over a long period of time. + heists! sound/voice acting + incredible level of detail in the writing of dialogue. it is equally performed as such by the actors. extra stuff + there is an essentially endless amount of extras and exploration and easter eggs to deal with if your into that. + cant wait for the mod community to do what they do. some more hud/ui customizability for starters the state of my well being + this game is the purest crack rock one could ever light up. - my skin is slowly fusing to my chair from video game addiction. ?:)",124.6

"ive been waiting for this since ever and finally its here :d since it came out yesterday i only played a bit, no crashes, no bug, no framerate issues and i wonder how smooth social club has become, you dont even notice it, it only flashes up when you start the game for 5 seconds. after reading other negative reviews i decided to write my own because i cant quite understand how ppl can be so stupid to not get this game running.. on steam, it isnt going to get any easier folks... -.- so good game, totally worth waiting and paying 60 bucks 10/10 would hit a fat lady in leggins again",24.3
"beastly optimization, a brand new experience compared to console!",22.1
"gta online comes bundled in, of course, bringing rockstars online multiplayer crime sim to the pc for the first time. its due a reappraisal now that the new heist missions have been dropped in, but its still a slightly odd combination of open-world exploration and ad-hoc pvp larceny and murder (all good) and more straightforward shooter and racer events, which dont really play to gtas strengths. its fun, but not battlefield: hardline.",47.0

"the launcher crashes after a couple seconds. no fixes are on the website, and im kinda pissed that this game has such a crappy launch after all this time. update: i managed to get it working by turning off my graphics card before i selected the launcher and turning it back on once the game started. of course, this meant i had to quit the game because its impossible to play with the integrated intel gpu, but this means the launcher crashes again. so in order for me to play the game, i have to go to my device manager to turn off the gpu, start up the game, re-enable the gpu, kill the game via task manager, then restart the game via the unexpected game crash message that pops up as a result. a bit better than not being able to play at all, but still completely ridiculous. im going to see if i can find a torrent for this game because im sick of dealing with the bullcrap i have to go through to get this thing to freaking work. if your game works fine, then good for you, have fun, but if youre reading this and have a gaming laptop youre planning to play this on, then i strongly recommend you save your money until rockstar or steam fix this issue. unless youre willing to go through this process every time to play this game.",48.4
"on my first day of playing gta v, i realized this game is about freedom to do whatever you want. after completing 1,2 missions, i decided to hit the golf course at about 10:30 pm. a sharp pain in my right eye broke my concentration and ive messed up the shot. alas, when i looked upon the cellphone clock, it was 4:30 am and my eyes were bleeding. but i honestly cant remember when i had so much fun in life, and i have a pretty cool life too, cant complain. the thing is, there is so much to do, so much to see, im guessing its gonna take me 100+ hours to see it all. every ride reveals beautiful, realistic eye candy that just puts a smile. dont believe me? grab a chopper or a plane and gain some altitude, then look down on the city. it feels so alive, every car driving with a purpose, every pedestrian doing his own thing. this is so much more than a video game, its the video game. its a life simulator that it sadly, way more fun than real life. p.s. one of the best optimised games for pc ever. looks and plays wonderful. i have to sleep now, or ill die.",61.3

"the definitive gta:v experience which, for me, was the ultimate multi-player game of the last generation. granted, its been a bit of a wait for the pc crowd, and the online facet of the game is not without its glitches (abominable lag despite having a +100 mbps connection, jumping into a car and not being able to drive for some reason, weird vehicle damage modelling loops, just-killed enemies coming back to life due to disparity between local and server-side assets, etc.), but when you compare it to similar games in the genre, i still think its way ahead of the competition. yes, the delays should have meant a more stable launch, and i agree that the whole windows username thing, whilst not affecting me personally, is a pretty big oversight, but a quick patch or two later and it should all be rectified. then again, im one of the jerks whos been playing it on xb360 and ps4 for the last year and a half, so im probably a whole lot more forgiving than the average pc user. either way, its a 09/10 from me - now we just gotta wait for a pc remake/sequel to red dead redemption.",19.5

"so far so good! im running win8.1, a 4790k, sli gtx 780s, and 16gb of ram. the game is installed on a 7200rpm hdd. i realize some people are having technical issues, and i understand that can be very frustrating, but trust me when i say its worth it. these are probably some of the nicest lighting effects ive seen in a game. i have every setting maxed out, except for msaa, txaa, and the high detail shadows. my vram is my bottleneck unfortunately, so adding any of those options puts me into the 30-40fps region. i am running the game at 1440p so this is a pretty demanding setup. in the city im sitting in the 60-80fps region and in the country areas its 40-50fps or so. i do notice that when driving very fast across the map i hit moments of 30fps, and im not sure if this is because of the game loading the next section of the map or if its because my settings are too high (theres a ton of vegetation in the country areas) so one way or the other ill even out some settings to get 60+fps constant if possible. as for the story and gameplay, its gta. i played through the entire game on the xb360 version so i have less motivation to play the main story currently, but i assume its basically just the same, and the main story was awesome on xb360 so i cant see why it wouldnt be just as good here. one thing i really noticed is that the cutscenes are actually enjoyable to watch now. the console cutscenes ran so slow and choppy it was hard to even pay attention to the story, but so long as your settings are done correctly they will run at a nice 60hz+ and it becomes much easier to get sucked into the story. just understand what youre buying. its still gta, just like the console version, but with a lot of great new visuals and online features. if youre looking for a game to really tax your system this is it!",13.2

(i can only vouch for amd) the game is not optimized for pc yet. it crashes randomly, i get ballz fps drop when driving, flying, ect (i have an amd 6970 in crossfire. thats 4gb video memory) around 30-45 fps, and the graphics option and advanced graphics options dont really give that much. it needs more options and locations on how to change this. i cant even edit it manualy through the file browser in windows where its installed. i love the cut scenes and story mode but if the game isnt optimized i cant even play it! rockstar please fix this. i know its all softwear sided. many pc gamers have been waiting forever, including me, for this game to come out and the least you could do is make it run smooth.",63.4

"meth heads banging, dogs having sex, ambulances rushing to a npcs aid only to leave that npc on the road only to be continually run over by othe npcs is only a fraction of what you can find in this game. not only is the main story engaging, but is rife with homages to decades of film and pop culture (including the garbage pop culture, which i love that rockstar does not hold back in making fun of). although i have not touched the online mode or the editor as of yet, i can only imagine at how much more they add to the gta experience. best gta yet, (although i do miss liberty city tunes), and may be the best game of 2015. i know its bene out of consoles for a couple yrs now, but as far as im concerned pc trumps all.",55.1

"summary: gta v is the game pc gamers have been waiting for. the hype is real. holy crap, its well optimized, looks amazing, plays great, and most players wont feasibly run out of content for a long time. gameplay: for the uninitiated, gta v plays out drastically different than its predecessors. there are three playable protagonists, each of whom are very different. franklin is just a kid looking for an out of his crap life. michael is an ex bank robber trying to stay retired (spoiler alert: this doesnt work out). and trevor, oh trevor. hes the wild card of the group. his character has to be one of the funniest ive played in a long time. outside of story missions, you can swap between the three at any given time. the coolest thing is seeing what theyre up to in their free time. there are some times youll swap to trevor and hes just waking up drunk at the top of mt. chiliad in a dress. this also breathes new life into story missions, as where previously you wait for the ai to complete an action you can now just do it yourself and swap back to your favorite one of the trio. the best mission that exemplefies this is when all three are in a firefight but theyre taking different roles. franklin is taking point, using snipar riffles or rpgs. michael and trevor are taking the front and flank, gunning down baddies with their assault riffles. youre free to swap at any time and go from sniping to shotgunning. r* did a fantastic job with this. also, driving is great. as someone who plays a lot of arcade and sim racers, this one really bridges the gap between being easy to pick up but difficult to master. also, car customization is worth the money alone. each and every single car of the sizeable car list has its own different cosmetic changes. and frankly, the choices are on par, if not superior to the lackluster the crew. story: (for those wondering ive beaten the story twice on x360) its been a long time since a shooty shooty fun fun game like this had a story that captured my attention. there are a number of solid plot twists, which i actually didnt see coming for once. and the heists, oh the heists. theyre worked perfectly into the main story line and give them actual purpose other than to just make the main characters money. the ending is a bit surprising to say the least. there are 3 endings, however i recommend to all to pick choice c. when the time comes youll understand this choice. graphics: this was the area many were worried r* would skimp on for the pc version, and im happy to report the worries were unwarrented. this game looks fantastic. this is one of the, if not the, first true next gen games to come out. every single graphical issue from the last gen of consoles is gone (although i am rocking a much better setup than the 360) and the game still works in more graphical detail without skipping a beat. jesus is it pretty. the reflections are second to none, and on rainy nights the city really comes to life and comes so close to realism. its insane. my only major complaint is with the textures on medium (which is the max recommended for 2gb cards) some of the textures are muddy but still as a whole this game is gorgeous. optimization: the other area people were concerned with. the good news is its a really solid version. my specs: evga gtx 760 sc ed i7 3770 8gb ddr3 1600mhz ram 1tb 7200rpm hdd windoge 8 i have everything on high except no aa and textures on medium (high and very high recommend upwards of 2gb), and i get a solid 60fps with very few dips here and there. i seriously want to get a 3gb gfx card just to see these insane textures. online: the reason most people are buying this game. holy crap is it fun especially with friends. online is structured extremely well. you start out with a crap car, no money, and play a variety of game modes to get money, level up, and purchase weapons, cars, apartments, and more. basically, its the multiplayer of gta iv but with persistent leveling. apparently r* learned their lessons with the x360 and ps3 launch of online because day one i got on with no issues. misc: only major problem with the game so far has to be the long load times. the load to get into the game from launch is nearly as long as the x360 version. fix this r*!! also, for those waiting on mods, it seems r* made it a tad harder to decrypt the game files. that said, there are already trainers out there. just dont use them online and ruin the game for the rest of us. and finally, the first person mode is a refreshing take on the gta games. its there if you want it but can be safely ignored for a traditional gta experience. that said, i recommend at least trying it. r* really paid attention to deal and rather than simply change the camera position, everything has a crisp first person animation. final verdict: you know youre gonna get it anyway. just grab it. unless you really end up hating the game, theres no way youre gonna get less than 60 hours out of it. or wait a while for a sale. i dont care. just know this is absolutely the superior version of the game.",31.8

"its with a heavy heart i have to give gta v a bad review - for now. i, like many other laptop users with mobile graphics cards, are experiencing crashing issues nonstop that has completely ruined the experience. story mode, i get a crash roughly every 5-10 loading screens, online (the main reason i bought the game), i get a crash every loading screen so i havent gotten to play it yet at all. i also randomly get crashes on startup. its really a bummer. im a poor college kid so when i spend 60 on a game its a huge deal to me. its a bigger deal when i spend that 60 and i cant play the game. aside from that, the game is really excellent, and when this issue is resolved and i can play the game i will edit this review to reflect the true nature of the game. however, because i cant play the game for more than a half hour at a time before i experience a crash, i cant recommend this game to anyone, especially laptop users who use mobile graphics cards. from what ive read, rockstar doesnt have a fix for these issues pending just yet so save your money and buy when you know youre going to be able to actually play the game and get the experience you paid for.",17.3

"pc master race has waited years to get our hands on this game. the real question is was this game worth the wait? initially the game plays fantastically i basically had zero issues with the port. the game is very immersive, beautiful, and quite a bit of fun. the only issue is as you progress on into the game (33% completion singleplayer blitz heist) the game really starts to show its true colors. game crashes over and over again on this mission basically halting all your progress. i had to look up online a potential fix for this issue. which requires you to park in some really asinine place so when it warps from franklin to michael the game doesnt freeze up requiring you to start completely over again. beyond that mission there are several other somewhat game breaking bugs which will freeze up the game completely halting progress, and requiring you to start over which is really really annoying. the last annoying thing i want to address is the whole stock market integration. want to lose all your money that you preordered use the stock market in offline mode. it will allow you to buy stocks but then your money will just disappear into thin air when you want to see whats happened to it. this happened to me with basically all my preorder dlc money. that money will never be returned by rockstar especially with their little shark cards that they want people to buy. i still like rockstar as a company, and i am well aware this game will be fixed eventually. but my experience thus far doesnt justify a buy because these types of bugs shouldnt ship with a aaa title. requiring players to find work arounds for glaring mission issues this early in the titles release with no fix in sight just seems lazy. we shouldnt be your quality control testers when the game took this long to port to pc. i rate this game a 6.5/10 with a do not buy until these single player issues are fixed. current rig: i5-4690 16 gb ram 770 gtx 4 gig asus z97-a motherboard",9.3
"grand theft auto v: a game even better on pc. i have fun playing this game, loads of content, graphics are good altho it doesnt really run stable with my gpu (6950 2gb oc). the game tends to crash and freeze a load which will hopefully get patched later. overall, this is a damn good game with some minor issues.",58.0
"for some reason i cant even open the game cause the game asks me to log in to my social club account and then to link a social club account which i then did, several times over and over, but the game still asks me the same thing!!! what the hell is wrong with this. i even then tried to link with a new account but the same issue occurred. it seems that what ever i do it wont let me play the damn game! for that reason and that reason only so far since i loved playing the game on x360 i will vote this game a no!!! rockstar fix this!!!",10.1

"ive been waiting to type this for a while. i previously owned this game on the xbox, the first little gem is that if you played it on console, you can transfer your character and carry on where you left off, brilliant right?! now when i used to play on the xbox, it seemed like everybody was scared to speak because someone was waiting with their headset plugged in just to say hey i ed your mom !!! but the beauty of pc gaming is that it all seems to be more social and friendly. if you dont want to use your mic, you can type! theres no excuse to be unsociable like on console games and thats something that appeals to me a lot. the same goes for payday 2, horrible game on the consoles but fantastic on the pc. heists are fantastic, dont be put off by low levelled players joining your game, i played an entire heist with a bunch of low levelled guys around 9-15 and they stuck the entire thing out and did a fantastic job. i would encourage everybody to buy this game, make sure your headset is working and be a sociable player because it really is rewarding. also i would definitely reccommend using an xbox controller a thousand times because the keys feel so spaced out for some reason. driving with wasd and using your phone with the arrow keys whilst trying to look around with your mouse is a recipe for disaster. go grab yourself a remote because youll definitely feel more comfortable with one.",29.7

"first of this game is insanely optimized compared to many pc games this year (especially ubisoft) , it is so well optimized that runs at 60fps on my 670 at very high, with vsync on which i was honestly not expecting. one of the best console ports of all time in my opinion. now onto the map, los santos is incredibly detailed, some of the best map design i have ever seen, that combined with all the interactive elements of the map like the pedestrians make the city feel truly alive, and almost real. in addition it seems that the graphics were not comprimised to be on the level of the consoles, they are truly pcmr. the graphics look truly great with awesome render distances, crisp textures, tons of dense foliage, great shadows , insane character models and sharp reflections, not to menton 60 fps and that is at very high settings not even ultra. leaves all consoles in the dust! in addition the game appears to be really stable, other than some online connectivity issues that do not allow me to join friends games or invite them, which is a massive inconvenience. besides that it has not really given me any trouble what so ever. however the game while glorious is not perfect, the biggest dissapointment so far for me is that the driving mechanics are currently severely lacking (suspensions are too planted, handles like the car is on rails, and cars seem to be virtually indestructable, the car damage is severely lacking, braking times are unrealistic.......) one additional minor complaint is that the first person fov is way too small at the max, i usually have it much much higher in other first person games. if rockstar patched those issues with the game it would be an easy 10/10, game of the century. other than that it is a near perfect technical masterpiece. although the wait was way too damn long, the result is nothing short of epic. the world is detailed, the graphics rock, and it actually seems stable unlike gta iv. the experience is marred by the driving issues, connectivity and the fov, but honestly it doesnt take too much away from the overall experience, making this one of the games i would easily recommend to everyone as a must own. my expectations have been blown, thank you rockstar and gaben, for this incredible feat of videogame engineering, even after the ing 3 year wait. it was worth every minute of waiting 9/10 would buy again! oh... i forgot no more bowling!! 10/10 must own",32.5

"i bought this game when it was released back in 2013 for ps3 and xbox360. i played alot of online and a little bit of singleplayer. i enjoy online the most i think its what makes this game great being able to access the entire map and do whatever you please. now that i own a decent gaming laptop, the graphics are gorgeous and vivid. i am playing at 900p and getting about 35-40 fps. back on ps3 the graphics are unbearable and i dont know how my eyes got used to the frames. i havent noticed any pop in whatsoever (coming from a regular 5400rpm 1tb hdd user). there is a bit of jaggies and stuttering but i have it under control when i set up maximum pre rendered frames to 1 in my nvidia control papnel and power management to maximum performance. i would reccomend this game to anyone it is truely amazing how rockstar developed this game allowing those with not very good specs to play this game even at normal settings the game still looks beautiful. thank you rockstar thank you pc please guys get this game youll be amazed!",14.2
"gta v was already one of the greatest game i have played ( and i am not a fan of the serie, the complete opposite) and now with ultimate edtion pc port. he has the greatest graphic of all . the pc version is well optimised and can run on many gaming computer slower or faster ones there is even a 4k option. i can compare this pc port with a blizzard game if you played any of them you know they are really really well optimized. the push back from release was totally worth it. if i had to say cons about the game. are how the multiplayer is made rockstar should have implemented a party system. and the possibilities of finding remplacement player for the heist dlc and less loading, but they are faster than the console port. there is also the ragdoll but this was also a problem in gta iv as well its a problem with all rockstar game because they are using euphoria physic engine. anyway the game is totally worth it. you got a beautifull game with a great and funny story like only rockstar know how to do. and a great multiplayer with a lot of content. and its big heist mission in solo have two variation. so you can almost double the lenght of the game.",43.4

"an overall astonishing game, although i noticed when the preload gave me my $1.35 mil, it spread out to gta online, etc. on story, only franklin got money, he got all $500k, oddly, trevor had $100k to start with, which really confused me. overall amazing gameplay experience, good action, nice hud layout, everything, just, flawless. definately worth $60",21.1
"this is a performance review! i barely meet the minimum specs and it runs great! never had it crash and it stays around 40 fps, though the textures on everything but faces and cars look awful. in online it still runs good even when a bunch of idiots with grenade launchers blow everything up. pretty much what i mean is i havent had a single problem, but remember to update your graphics drivers! it makes a big difference!",33.1

"the game is fun. i have not gotten very far into the single player but it is enjoyable.... however i do not recommend this game for one reason. because i can not get multiplayer to work. nothing i try works and i even replaced my router. i called rockstar support and the guy i spoke to could not even think of anything to try. what a joke. if you do not care about the multiplayer and are only looking for a single player experience then by all means go for it, you will injoy it. however, if you are buying this game to play online then you are taking a risk. you may be like other people and have no issues, or you may end up like me, be put into empty session after empty free roam session and waiting 30+ minutes to do races or missions or even death matches with other people. save your money, spend it else where. i am never buying a next gen game ever again. *** update *** i finally got the online working. so i bet you are thinking, why is this still not recommended? because to get it to work, i had to re-direct my internet traffic thru to canada via vpn. i have it pointing to the west coast now and it is still working. soooo yeah, the game is loads of fun but i would suggest waiting till they fix this problem which is obviously on their end. :/",36.4

"the story mode is awesome, one of the few games to truly entertain me in fact. the online part though is one of the worst gaming experiences ive ever had. i used to think wow was full of immature, idiotic players with nothing better to do than screw with other players but gta online is way worse. every job requires you to team up with other players who ruin the experience. players should be able to choose to play alone even when online and not have to deal with other players. as of right now i dont believe the game is worth the price due to half of it being borderline unplayable and not enjoyable. the online part has no real story or depth and between that and the idiots who ruin the game for you by randomly attacking you and ruining any fun in jobs, then their isnt anything to grip your attention and keep you playing. bottom line, the story mode is great but the online mode is horrible and should be avoided.",100.4

"its beast",65.8
"at first i had rated this game poor due to constant crashes and lock ups with it. i had thought it was the game itself, but after some trouble shooting i found the root cause was an outdated bios on my motherboard. seems gta v is the first game to push the cpu hard enough to expose the issue with the older bios. after the bios update the game has yet to crash or lockup. if you have an asus maximus vi motherboard with a bios older than rev 1603 installed and have lockups / crashes. install rev 1603, it will fix the lockup and crash issues. this is by far the best gta game yet and the pc version was worth waiting for. the graphics are insane. being able to jump between mouse and keyboard and 360 controller is awesome. drive a car on the controller, get to a roof top, then jump to mouse and keyboard and use a sniper rifle. my pc can run this on max settings and rarely see fps drop under 52 fps: i7-4790k 16 gb geforce 980gtx 500 gb samsung 850 windows 10 pro",16.4

"great game, almost perfect port(except by windows account problems, some random fps drop, and alt+tab screwing the game). some missions are boring and lame,and some others are ing impossible(requires you to switch the character every five seconds because the dumb ai cant take the anothers characters to be covered,they simply will run into the firefight and get hit and killed and the mission will fail), but it`s no problem since the game have the skip feature. theres also some glitches that will happen when youre inside the mission(like the target that you need to kill get godmode and resist 11 sniper headshots,when you lose the cops and step on the street they will start to looking for you again even after 5 minutes after the stars got away) the gta online is funny to play even when you arent playing with friends, i dont explored the full experience of gta online but its look great! long story short, you might buy this game,both singleplayer and multiplayer are good. good job rockstar,even with the delayed release, it worth it!",54.6

(except for a true fov slider). the game runs well on a variety of machines and scales very well to different setups. my set up is; 12 gigs of ram, amd fx-6300 hexa-core cpu, and a nvidia gtx 970 gpu. with this set-up i can achieve almost all maxed out settings at 1080p. with the technical aspects aside the game is pretty much the same as the latest generation consoles, with noticeable improved controls for shooting while using mouse and keyboard and vastly improved draw distance. those who are frustrated at the issues downloading and the rockstar social club, it is understandable, but rating the game based on those issues and not the game itself is very unreasonable; the purpose of a review to provide insight on the game itself, not reviewing overloaded servers on the day of launch. no game is perfect, thus rating any game 10 is idiotic, but if any game is deserving of my highest praise, gta v would be that game. i highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of sandbox games or a fan of previous rockstar games.",16.0

"the long wait has been worth it. if youre a pc gamer whos spent the last eighteen months envying the console crowd while they all got stuck into the latest, greatest gta, then rest assured that you can now play the definitive version. sure, the xbox one and ps4 versions were amazing, delivering gta 5 at higher resolutions with more detailed textures, smoother surfaces, better lighting and cool depth of field effects (see our full review below), but the pc version offers even more enhancements plus a couple of additional features that play to the pcs strengths. in doing so, it adds a few more metres to one of gamings towering achievements. having covered the game twice already, we wont go too far into the detail of what makes gta 5 so good. partly, its a question of experience. with four previous 3d gtas under its belt plus red dead redemption, bully and assorted dlc packs, rockstar has had time to refine its vision for open world gameplay and its systems, and gta 5 has the best driving, the best shooting and some of the best mission design of the series. its also a question of structure. dividing the action amongst three protagonists with three interlocking storylines and three distinctive flavours means you nearly always have the option to flick from michaels ageing career criminal saga to franklins ambitious hoodlum story to trevors crazed, amoral brand of mayhem, where the dumb, cathartic slapstick violence we all  deep down  love gta for finds its natural home. with repeated play, it only becomes clearer how well all three tales mesh thematically with rockstars savage satirical take on the californian dream.",139.2

"i love this game.there are way too many things that are great about it to even know where to begin. but just to start there was obviously a huge amount of time and thought that went into this the open world is not only vast with tons of things to explore but its also well thought out and interesting not just huge and the graphics of this game are incredible and the physics....well let me finish by saying if i could only buy a single game this year it would have to be this one.....enjoy!!!",19.4
"of all the millions of games out there, very very few can be perfect, flawless and deserve an undoubtable full score. and gta v is one of these games, that should be remembered in the history of gaming, and deserve as much fame and recognition as titles such as zelda : ocarina of time and portal 2. this is my review in short. to those unfamiliar with gta, these are some of the things you can do in this game: * walk, run, stealth, swim, parachute * bikes, cars, boats, yachts, planes, helicopters, fighters * fight hand-to-hand, or with bats/knives * pistols, shotguns, machine guns, rifles, minigun, rpgs, grenades, bombs * exercise to raise strength/health/shooting skill/driving skill * play tennis/golf * cop chase * direct, shoot and share videos * lengthy single player campaign * massive online campaign * in short: anything and here are some of the improvements from gta iv: * 3 playable characters instead of 1 * improved hud that takes less space and shows more info * ability to replay previous missions and challenge extra missions objectives * ability to retry mission from midway after failure * more to be found... i do have one complaint for the single player campaign: the very first mission contains shooting scenes, that used to appear only after several missions in previous games. i worry that later missions may become much harder. for now though, it should be no problem. in conclusion, this is the ultimate game to be created. 10 out of 10, masterpiece.",5.8
"at the moment the console version is better there is alot of issues. i have never once played without some sort of issue. its either a graphic error, the game minimizing and not opening, randomely freezing but i can still hear sounds around me, or it wont even launch. 2 years and the only thing different is the number of players and the graphics its kinda dissapointing atm.",21.3

"until they fix the ongoing problem of still a large amount of players that cant even get past the social club this gets a thumbs down. as expected gtav was released to pc with a boat load of bugs just how it was released on ps3 and 360 for the first time. social club support is as horrid as steam support because no one answers your question. i really want to play this damn game but now i have to waittill they fix this game.",7.9

"my laptop has 3840*2160 resolution. but i cant seem to be able to run the game in that resolution. and the game screen occupy only a portion of the screen. and the game crash if i change the resolution to 3840. please somebody help me. i cant even run the game in fullscreen mode! my gameplay experience had been disappointing because of this.",14.3
"the game is fun enough, the story is funny and you always have something to do. online is kinda lame since youd normally go from single player with all the items to online with nothing, and if you dont have a group it seems like a gank fest for the most part which can be fun if youre into that kind of thing. my only real complaint about the game is the horrible controls. with a gamepad its not to bad but mouse / keyboard it is so awkward and clunky. for example you go through the game using wasd for movement and then suddenly go into a plane and it wants you to use your num pad, wasd, and then youre expect to look around with your mouse. they could have done a lot better with just using your mouse to steer the plane and wasd to control pwr and left and right (forgeting the name). the game is fun and once you get over the controls is very good. id highly suggest atlest having a gamepad of some sort atlest plugged in for those flight missions since its very easy to switch between the two.",7.6
"could play at launch, only had one unexplained crash. story mode is alright, multiplayer needs a bit of stability improvement, but graphics and average fps are top-notch. this is how pc games should be released instead of bullspit deadlines and moronic over-hype. just wish it would have come out sooner than waiting so long for two generations of consoles to beta-test.",62.3

"i believe there isnt much to say about the quality of the game, since the name stands for quality itself. rockstar never let their fans down and the products they release are always a master piece - gta v is no different and is probably the masterpiece of the masterpiece. using the same technology from la noir and an improved engine from gta iv, gta v is an amazing game, making you have nerd-s every time the loading screen finishes and you start playing. different from other game developing companies, rockstar knows it takes years and effort to deliver quality and that is what they have been working on for so long making the time waiting finally pay off. gta is a game made by highly talented professionals to game-lovers. very optmized and fantastic in every single small detail. from the random events that occur when you are driving by the city to the movie-like missions you will come cross. rockstar has my respect in all senses. you fell involved with all the environment the cities has to offer making you want to play it more and more and more. although they use their own software to store saving progress and friends, it is still well designed and friendly - and this surprised me, because we had bad experiences with gta iv in this sense. well, the fact is that it can not be compared to the trash ubish*t and ea call game and gaming-platform. all i have to say is: well done, rockstar! you do respect your fans and are great professionals. i would pay double if i had to if i could have products like this in my computer. pros: - amazing storyline; - outstanding gameplay; - astonishing graphics; - awesome in every single small detail; - well-designed missions; - very optmized; - perfect controllability; - a truly gaming master piece cons: - small bugs; - nothing else! ubisofty, activision and ea. please learn with these gentleman how to treat your costumer and develop softwares. thanks.",118.9

"very disappointing. having not played this on another platform previously, it was entirely new to me. the plot is very very poorly written, haphazard, vague, and short. if i hadnt messed about doing unnecessary things it could easily be completed in 10 hours. compared with gta 4, the story is severely lacking. the graphics engine and port to pc however, very well done. after the debacle with the gta 4 port i was worried. but this was ported very well and even on an old machine runs well on mid graphics. the online experience isnt particularly inspiring however. feels like they tried to include a lot, and in doing so made it quite unenjoyable. i wish i could recommend this, the engine and potential are great. but the story and characters are just pathetically scripted. their actions in the parts you cannot control make no sense at all (including the npcs), and if there is a plot that youre supposed to be able to follow, it seems huge parts of it are never spoken, and just assumed happened. wait until its on offer, was not worth preordering.",56.8
"this is a very well made game; however, at the time of this review, the gta online portion sucks...it is really laggy and there are some major sync issues. i havent had any problems with the single player though. i hope they continue to patch it so that he multiplayer is not shoddy, and i think they eventually will. rockstar isnt going to give up on us. its just disappointing since it took them two years and 3 delays to release it. there is no real good excuse other than they are new to doing this online for pc. anyway, fun as hell. never had so much fun doing a burnout on a hookers face, and you can do it in 4k too!",26.8

"goty for another year. gta 5 was the best in the series and a fantastic game on its own right on the consoles and the pc version is definitively superior to all the rest. online is fun and engaging even for someone who doesnt really enjoy multiplayer. theres something for everyone here. as long as you like armed robbery.",118.8
"games good, but after 30 minutes or so i get crazy stuttering/lurching/hitching/frame drops/whatever you want to call it. the game runs at a stable, silky 60fps for a half hour or so, and then itll start lurching down to 30-40fps at random intervals every few seconds until i restart the game. usually itll start after ive driven somewhere fast, but once it starts i can be sitting stationary in a safehouse and itll still continue unabated. i run a 660ti and i7 3770 with 8gb of ddr3 for anyone who cares, but its not a hardware issue: ive been reading around forums with people with identical issues who run the whole gamut of available hardware configurations, from amd to intel and nvidia, from high-end to low-end. just be aware that until they fix this, buying this game is a roulette of performance irrespective of the power of your setup: maybe youll get lucky and be in the majority who find it smooth, or maybe youll be condemned to frame stutter hell like me and a bunch of other people. ill edit this review to recommend this game when they fix the problem.",59.6
"im sure everyone knows what gta is, so i will skip right to it. the pc version is extreme well optimized. i have been running it with barely over minimum system requirements, and although the graphics are pretty limited with my crap computer, the game still runs smooth. i may update this after i install my new gpu. i love the self radio station, where it allows you to import your own music playlists into the game and listen to them either as a regular playlist, or as an actual radio station with dj commentary in between songs. the rockstar editor tool is also amazing, allowing you to film your gameplay and edit yourr clips into a movie for uploading on youtube, and you can upload your clips directly from the in-game menu. you can seemlessly switch between using your game pad, and your keyboard/mouse, without needing to change any settings. this helps with navigating menus and editing your rockstar editor clips. i cant say much about the graphics, for reasons i have already stated, but im told its amazing with a proper gpu. bottom line, this game is well worth your money, even if you already own it on a console.",39.6
"amazing port very fun. i played they story mode on ps3 a while back and that was fun. i have only been playing online on pc and i love all the updates. the first person is great and its really fun to play with friends or do a pick up mission and play with randoms (hoping they have mics). all and all very worth it",64.8
"so after 46h of play time i have edit my review. way too many reasons. i start with positive. absolutely beautfill graphics, great story what will drag you in, switchable charatchers, lots of cars, planes, boats . . . . you name it massive map. it can be fun online (if you have money for fun) bad things about the game. not sure where to start :/ here we go loading time, loading time, loading times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! to start a game wait 5 minutes to start mision 5 minutes to switch to online 5 minutes to switch to new mision 5 minutes to change session 5 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! next. game is made for 60fps and if you get anything below that becuase of performance issues you will see it, at 30fps, 40fps game is unplayable as its trying to force 60fps and it will lag even more. lieing about spec. at 1920x1080 fullscreen directx11 and evertyhing is lowest or turned off game reqires 2.1gb of gpu, what means you have to turn limiters off if you have 2gb gpu. everything maxed out?? you looking at 8gb+ next. gta online. servers are absolutely ! my internet is fiber optic super fast and every player is lagging as hell. you will get randomly kicked out of sesion because of unstable servers! impossible to make money in gta online. i started with 1mil and i bought house, car, guns, ammunition and snack for helth. after that i didnt make any money. try making money from races or any jobs or anything but still you will end up buying ammunition, armor, and snacks. no matchmaking. try doing races when you are lvl20 with stock car agaisnt lvl150 with fully upgraded car, you will never win, you will never make money. basically you playing against someone who played this game for almost 2 years! gta heists. almost impossible to find players who want to do it and you need 4 players. and 95% of all time 1 of them will disconnect just to  up your game. yeah, so if you are almost done with mision and 1 of them disconnects you are ed and will have to start all over again. autosave failures. yeah this game autosaves and lots of times you get warning failed to save! yesterday i lost lots of money because of that. final verdict. gta5 singleplayer misions/story very good and recommended. gta5 online broken, laggy, cant make money, no players want to play, sesions keep closing for no reason, no players for heists, heists are unplaybale. players will kill you for no reason. they not gonna gain xp or money or any kind of  but they will kill you for fun. even if you have expensive car and they blow it up they will have to pay you to recover it and they know it and they will blow it up. is it worth it? no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! download it for free and play singleplayer thats worth it. if you want multiplayer dont buy this , shame i did :/",63.4

"the patch and amd driver update (beta) actually made the game a lot faster and more stable (it was barely playable at first). there are some technical flaws thogh. nice visuals, quite stable fps, a-lot-of-new to explore and learn. suddenly theres something more time consuming than skyrim. i didnt try gta online yet since my internet is very unstable atm; people say its chaos and the most of the time you watch load screens, not los santos. im very happy with the singpleplayer so far. maybe the game is not totally worth the full price (i usually buy games on huge sales), but its not waste either. so, im pretty happy with the buy and i look forward for new updates/fixes. specs: msi gx70 laptop (fullhd) amd a10 5750m (2.5/3.2 ghz) radeon hd8970m 2gb gddr5 16gb ddr3 1600mhz 7200 rpm hdd win7 64 settings: 1920x1080 high texture quality high shadow quality high reflections quality softest shadows v-sync: half (30 fps) fxaa the rest is low/default. 9.5/10 (not so satisfying shooting, few other things are off, otherwise very enjoyable). 2015-04-17",19.7

"best game i have played for years and years... i am so speechless over how good a job rockstar did on this game. i am beyond any doubt convinced that even if games of this genre dont apply to your type of gaming, you will bow in honor to how well this game is made. i will admit that even tho i never really played any of the previous titles in this franchise, i must admit that they have done a better job for each release over the years... atleast according to a big number of my friends that have played all the prequals. seriously no cons at all here and i can say that with confidence, specially since i have completed the single player part and thrown a decent amount of time on the multiplayer part wich is if you dont mind me saying a full game by its self. i have gain such a respect for rockstar that i might blindly and with out checking any reviews by what ever next game they develop. that is to say if they keep up the level of quality and content as they have done with this game. like i said before the game is so good that even if games like this is not your cup of tea (usually) then i think you should find a way of trying it out so you can see what the hell im talking about or just trust me and buy the game if you have the correct speccs. if you somehow still are in doubt then wait a little while more and check out youtube for new pc only videos where people will be showing off the movie creator software that was included with this (pc) release, so you can see what fun this game really brings to the table. i already felt like i got my moneys worth when i finished the single player campaign and before i even touched the multiplayer part. and wtf? where are the bugs? i didnt see a single bug even tho im sure there are some xd. do not let the 4354 negative reviews effect your judgement in anyway since they all are the result of people not able to install the game correctly due to and i quote from steam : some customers are experiencing issues installing or playing gtav due to a windows user account name error. click here for details on how to workaround the issue. there for there is no real bad reviews about this game =). 100/10 insane replayablility",105.2

"buy this game! more fun then all of your barrels of monkeys. ---------------------------- 2nd day review: i love this game, as i have the origional console version, but this shaky launch has depressed me. 12 hours downloading the 60 gig install to find the game crashing on start up. i wanted to play, and this was my course of action: updated drivers, found some work arounds, disabled and re-enabled my graphics card, getting into the game, find some more problems, trouble shoot my graphical options to find something acceptable, play through some missions with 10 fps, mess up my display, restart and update display drivers to fix my new problems, mess with my device manager some more, get back into game (40+ fps), mess with my graphical and display options to be acceptable, mess up my display again... so far its a bunch of work, but possible to run. i dont have the minimal requirements to run the game (gpu is slightly under what is needed), but i can make it work with the lowest of settings at 800 x 600 to get 30 to 60 fps. from there the game can stutter after a few minutes of playing perfectly, missing textures, lagging user input, lag spikes with significant frame drops... the works. at first i thought all these issues were because of my pc, but seeing as i am not alone the culprit is obvious. as of now, for those wishing to play this game, wait a little bit. dont be like me and say oh look! gta on pc! must have! and impulse buy. an update may be around the corner to patch everything and make everyone happy. so, yeah, i dont recommend this game, yet. this game is awesome, it just needs a repair.",50.4

"this game is a beautifle, interactive, masterpiece that is packed with things to do. it is excellently optimised for pc and there arent many things that are negative to say about this game. rockstar has truely poured its heart and soul into this game and i look forward to the games they make in future untill then though i shall be exploring all the things to do in los santos and san andreas doing missions, races, deathmatches, and hiests with my friends, playing the amazing story with even more things to do, and creating my own missions with the rockstar creater and to top that all off with free dlc and more to come a true 11 out of 10.",37.6

"amazing improvement to the already great gta 5 for consoles. definitley worth picking up, although i am currently having some stuttering issues which i hope are fixed in a patch. other than that bug and a few other performance issues i recommend everyone reading this to buy the game.",42.3
"the hype was real. after owning gta v on both ps3 and ps4, gta v for pc just blows them out of the water. infact, it blows everything out of the atmosphere. i cant remember playing a game so well optimised for both low end and high end pcs, and being a regular of the arma series, to have something that runs silky smooth and looks incredible still amazes me! i have an i7 4790k ocd @ 4.7ghz, and x2 gtx 980s in sli. my native resolution is 1440p, but using nvidias dsr i am able to run the game in 4k resolution and with all the settings on max, with the exception of msaa. if you are using dsr, you do not need msaa. msaa renders the edges and takes a toll of performence, however if you are upscaling with dsr then it renders the whole image. with all that the game still runs at 60fps and minus i a few settings i can even take it up to 5120 x 2880 .. 5k! and it will still average between 30-50fps. i suggest if you are running in 4k or 5k to leave at least 500mb worth of vram. the reason for this is i found running it at its limit or over, the game stutters due to not having enough memory to load the textures as you go from one area to the next. leaving a bit of leeway allows the game to continue running smooth with no stutter, lag, etc.. i also suggest using v-sync in this game. screen tearing is very noticeable and if you only having a 60hz monitor it will look horrific. overall though this is exactly what pc gamers were waiting for, and expecting. it seems rockstar have delivered and minus a few release bugs (as anticipated with any release) this may be one of the smoothest releases in the last year, let alone the most well received.",47.5

"best game i have played for years and years... i am so speechless over how good a job rockstar did on this game. i am beyond any doubt convinced that even if games of this genre dont apply to your type of gaming, you will bow in honor to how well this game is made. i will admit that even tho i never really played any of the previous titles in this franchise, i must admit that they have done a better job for each release over the years... atleast according to a big number of my friends that have played all the prequals. seriously no cons at all here and i can say that with confidence, specially since i have completed the single player part and thrown a decent amount of time on the multiplayer part wich is if you dont mind me saying a full game by its self. i have gain such a respect for rockstar that i might blindly and with out checking any reviews by what ever next game they develop. that is to say if they keep up the level of quality and content as they have done with this game. like i said before the game is so good that even if games like this is not your cup of tea (usually) then i think you should find a way of trying it out so you can see what the hell im talking about or just trust me and buy the game if you have the correct speccs. if you somehow still are in doubt then wait a little while more and check out youtube for new pc only videos where people will be showing off the movie creator software that was included with this (pc) release, so you can see what fun this game really brings to the table. i already felt like i got my moneys worth when i finished the single player campaign and before i even touched the multiplayer part. and wtf? where are the bugs? i didnt see a single bug even tho im sure there are some xd. do not let the 4354 negative reviews effect your judgement in anyway since they all are the result of people not able to install the game correctly due to and i quote from steam : some customers are experiencing issues installing or playing gtav due to a windows user account name error. click here for details on how to workaround the issue. there for there is no real bad reviews about this game =). 100/10 insane replayablility",105.2

"before the details... if you havent played it yet, buy it right now, seriously, its great if you have the game on consoles, definitely buy it when its on a sale somewhere, its easy to run at 60fps without high end pcs, its worth it there is just so much to do in it, there wasnt a game that got me playing for hours these days, it was worth the wait for sure. if you do everything alongside the story missions, youll get above 70-80% completion and about 35+ hours out of this game, without playing online. you can customize your character in so many ways, unlike gta iv and there are rpg elements as well. there were a few problems, like crashing, but that seems to have been fixed by the latest patch, for me at least, also, no more microstuttering. online has one big problem... the loading times, not sure what causes this, it can be annoying, but im not going to complain about that, rather the players... they are there to kill you and nothing else, unless you are on a job with them or you play with friends in a private lobby. i have a somewhat high-end pc and i push the settings to the limit, which is very high(some ultra) settings and 1440p, and still getting above 60fps with adaptive vsync on. dont touch the advanced settings, those are the fps killer options without making the game much nicer. so tldr; singleplayer: tenouttaten, for me... but there are people who still have problems with the game (cant even launch etc.) online: 8/10, takes long to rank up if you dont get invited to do jobs",80.9

"been waiting 2 bloody years for it. and despite the delays, rockstar has really delivered on their promises. i know many people are having problems installing the game but this review is based on my experiences so far. if any problem arises ill be updating this review. as of right now its been awesome. in fact, this has been the best and smoothest running games ive seen . the graphical jump from the initial release to pc has been just jaw dropping, in fact, my mom walked by and thought i was watching some overly violent live action movie. the controls are way more solid compared to gta iv, no more accidentally stepping off ledges and to your unevitable death, shootings very cs like on the pc. i suck at cs so, uh, i got pwned pretty bad on deathmatches. love the weapon customization. just be sure to keep moving in free mode or keep yourself on passive mode if you just started. there are tons of hooligans who actively hunt the newbies to steal some of the preorder bonus cash you got. i know, had 130k nicked from me at lv 1. make sure you run to somewhere secluded or start a solo game so that you can bank in your cash safely. driving has so far been my favourite aspect of this game. the vehicles now actually feel grippy and resposive, car physicss quite similar to that of burnout paradise. update: while there is no fault with the game, rockstars drm on social club is essentially stopping me from fully enjoying it. repeated initialization errors and false hacking alarms constantly force you to restart the game and this makes for a very stressful experience online. so if youre willing to live with reliability issues, go ahead. if not, then i think you should get the console versions. im only sticking to this because its too late, as ive already dropped quite a sum for this game.",94.6

"ive been playing gta since it was top-down, and i put in ~300 hours on the 360 version of gta v as well. ive since sold the xbox, but have been maintaining and rebuilding my battlestation since then. needless to say, i was only slightly miffed i had to drop another $60 to pick it up another time. i was a little apprehensive about the game being a poor port ala gta iv, but it turned out there was no need to be. the game runs absolutely awesome for me, the only drawback springing to mind are some long load times, despite all 60+ gb of the game being installed on an ssd. ive noticed this mainly in multiplayer though, with an initial long load in sp then generally shorter ones thereafter. the graphics are mindblowing, and there are a lot of sliders in the options, giving you the opportunity to really fine-tune your settings and figure out what works best for you. after minimal configuration, im running at a bare minimum 60fps at all times and still marveling at just about everything in-game. playing with a mouse and keyboard was a simple transition for me, i was a bit concerned at first and intended to just play with a 360 controller, but instantly fell in love with mouse aiming. gta shooting was never the greatest but its a lot more reliable and entertaining with the ability to be somewhat precise. all-in-all, i definitely see another 300 hours of this in my future. once some mods start pouring out this game has the potential to be a longlived classic.",21.2
"this game is amazing! ignore the bitter people who are upset and clearly have mental issues. i have to admit that the game did take forever to come out, but its so worth the wait! the graphics the story and the multiplyer is well worth over $60 in my book. you could honestly play this game forever and there will alway be things to do....what other games can do that? (i still play all the old gtas still to this day...thats should say something.) loved the game! it going on my personal favs it lives up to the other gta games. one to keep on the shelf forever! thanks rockstar for making this beast game! pros: - unlimated game play. - easy acces. - great story. -awesome online. -free dlc updates. -sound track is new $ fun. - graphics realstic. - unlimited fun lol. cons: -delay of relase date. -little kids online. graphics - 10/10 story - 8/10 online 8/10 sound - 10/10 coustmer support - 10/10 **tips for the people who give this game a down vote or a bad review. your personal problems should not effect your review. either go buy a consle or buy a better pc that can run the game.**",91.4

"i got this game day 1 when it came out on ps3. i played the crap out of it and loved it. im glad to say that its worth paying for it all over again on pc. its even better of an experience. pros: +immersive setting (the city feels alive, but not as much as gtaivs lc) +tons of stuff to do (although dont expect sa levels of side missions) +great controls. you can switch from controller to k+m on the fly. this is incredibly useful for driving and then shooting, although the game does not require precise aiming except for a few challenges. first person view is a neat feature but i found myself switching back to third person after a while. +characters and story. this should be obvious by this point, having 3 characters really adds a twist of better development and pacing to the single player +variety. this is where the game shines. there are some really good sandbox games out there, like sleeping dogs or saints row, but they fell a bit boring after the story because you did mostly everything. dont get me wrong, this game doesnt have much to offer in terms of missions or jobs after the story, but it has variety, with such a big city you will find interesting stuff to do, to see, to even listen to. it keeps you interested due to the variety of locations and scenery. +online is awesome. not as deep as an mmo but definitely a really great social experience be it cooperative or competitive. even playing solo is fun. (i still consider red dead redemption to have the best online free roaming though). +visuals. it looks amazing. character models, lip syncing, particle effects, shadows, lights, all this is very pretty and it can run at a stable 60fps if your machine is powerful enough. bonus points for being able to lock it at 30fps as well from the game itself. +misc stuff: you can use your music, director mode, record clips, share pictures, create events, customize your characters, weapons and vehicles, theres so much in here to mention that id rather just leave it to you to find or enjoy. cons: -performance issues: this game is really well optimized, dont get me wrong, but for lower setups (meaning, a budget gaming pc or an older rig) the game is very cpu-heavy and will start using that vram like crazy after a relatively long session. -glitches and bugs: it launched recently so this is expected, but ive found things like inputs being stuck for a few frames over the actual press of the key (for example using the keyboard to turn a vehicle or to sprint can lead to overturning or not being able to stop running for a second or so) which is really, really annoying in some situations where precision is needed. doesnt seem to happen with the controller and i wonder if its actually my fault, which i doubt. some minor visual glitches for me that werent very noticeable. a lot of people are still unable to play the game or even launch it (and this is after a recent patch) too, which is ridiculous. -fov slider is useless. it doesnt even tell you the numeric values and it makes little noticeable difference. not a problem to a lot of people, but this is a simple setting that is missing from an otherwise impeccable settings menu. -a lot of keys. this normally isnt a problem and you can rebind them to your liking, which is good, but sometimes its a bit annoying to have so many keys, especially during vehicle use, that make you let your hand off the mouse to use the numpad or other keys placed awkwardly. granted, most of these actions are not required (turning on and off vehicle lights, weight shift in bikes, etc) but still. and thats why i also prefer a controller for driving. overall, i give this version 9/10 as of right now and i highly recommend it to everyone who wants to experience los santos in the best version possible. its well optimized but for such a huge game its expected to have issues running on lower setups, so be warned and research before you buy (although you should do that for every game anyway, its common sense). i didnt mention more subjective things like the music choice or storyline/storytelling itself, as its not really a valid praise/complaint to make when trying to be relatively objective.",17.4

"first day pc release launch issues aside..... pros: single player is awesome, everything i would hope for in a gta series. the graphics, city evniorment and scale of the sandbox is amazing. transitions between characters is a nice new feature. (best moment: switching to trevor and finding him passed out in a dress) plenty of side missions, activities and all the gta fluff to keep you busy and laughing. cons: *this is mostly focused on the online features* gta online is cool in theory. players vs npcs missions such as heists and bank missions are great... when everyone works together. great fun if you with a group of friends, huge mess with randoms. death matches of any kind are utter crap. weapon design and research leaves me scratching my head. apparently a short barrel shotgun can one shot you from 60 plus feet away with buckshot.... also body armor doesnt do much in player vs player, you will die instandly reguardless. the character physics and ragdolling is great fun in single player. annoying as hell in anykind of pvp senario and this especially applies to using 1st person mode. overall deathmatch or team deathmatch feels clunky and pointless. there are many other games that do it better. trying to join any kind of random invite to a mission will reult in some kind of network error 70% of the time. which in that case you will spend a great 30-40 seconds each time looking on the city from a bird eye view as it transitions from lobby to lobby. be prepared for lots on ten year old console babies screaming in their headset. in conclusion: the very nature of gta promotes ary sooo expect that from randoms in evey activity you do. recommend online if you have a solid group of friends to play with. if your running solo.... god help you, you poor sob.",20.5

"10/10 10/10 100/100 best game best game - jontron real review below: i played this game on ps4 and my thoughts there are far different than the pc version. the ps4 verion of gta v is locked at 30 fps (duh) but not only that, i find the framerate dropping online all the time. that made gtao impossible to play on the ps4 in almost any circumstance. they only time there wasnt any lag on gtao on ps4 was when i was in a private session or solo. when i played gta v on pc for the first time, all the problems i had with the ps4 version were out the window. this game looks fantastic on my pc, and i get over 100 fps (by the way, disable vsync if you get this for pc, that keeps the 60fps consistent) and i rarely find myself in a situation where the game has fps drops. although the first day was a bit rough online, there arent many triple a games that dont have that issue upon release on any platform. i would still like to see some things on the pc version. shark cards were great for me, because i really didnt feel like grinding missions (although i imagine heists would help, but i cant really get any of my friends to come online long enough for a heist.)for money, and from what ive heard it keeps the dlc free. im not sure if rockstar is going to do that, or if they got their share from the pre-purchases. i hope they do because that was a very useful option.",37.4

"having bought this game twice before i can tell you that, content wise, this game is absolutely excellent. port-wise, its fantastic. its unreal that a game can be so dense and detailed and still run at a rock solid 60fps. bravo rockstar, this game is well worth the 155 pounds ive spent on it so far.",5.9

"the game is great except for one thing. i really hate how im crashing multiple times in row for me and then being fine for maybe an hours. i feel like paying this much for the game and it being capatable for me i shouldnt have to deal with these kind of problems.",15.4
"this game is obviously one of the best gtas ever created. rather than tell you whats good about it (because the list is way too long), ill tell you where the game is lacking. the story for this game is very clich. there are no exciting twists to the story and its very predictable. think of an action movie from the 90s and thats your story here. the story started to pick up in the middle but then it seemed like they forgot about the buildup and they just went straight into the game. i didnt feel that transition i always felt with other gtas. another thing that this game forgot was activities. there are no police car missions and not as many interior buildings that gta iv had. i personally enjoyed walking into a burger shot and i was disappointed when i realized you couldnt visit any food places. sprunk machines are still there to give you health, but i prefer eating at an establishment like in san andreas or gta iv. the map itself is a decent size but one thing it lacks is dead space. im talking about the empty desert we experienced in san andreas; that feeling of being lost in the middle of nowhere. you dont get that with this game. every single part of the map is populated with roads, buildings or people. the only secluded areas i could find were the mountains (which werent that big, to be honest). the way the map was made removes a bit of the realism for me: its just a big island in the middle of the ocean. that, and the lack of dead space was unfortunate but one thing they did right was the underwater segment of the game. ever wrestle a shark? when you can in gta v! dont be dissuaded by my pessimistic review. keep in mind that this game is freakin amazing. so amazing that i just had to point out some of the flaws of it. the flaws are few with this game. gta online is still somewhat buggy but if you can get past that, you will enjoy another 50-100 hours off that. 8.5/10 - a technical and artistic wonder of the gaming world on par with skyrim.",32.3

"16th april 2015: after multiple delays the game wont even start for me and many others. two days after release not even a hint that a patch is on the way, just a work around for one of the many issues. yet again, cheated by rockstar. 20th april 2015: over a week since release, still no fix. but hey at least they added micro-transactions, that was really important _",0.4

"+18 game in my opinion, i would definitly not let kids play this game. - major gore which you can turn off. - adult dialog of rate r+ movie - explict language - nudity - moral issues - just to name a few with all that said, this game has a+ content, finally a multiplayer and single player game company that gives you what you pay for. finsihed smooth playing game (ya has few quirks need to be fixed still) but man this is one complete game that makes you think about how much more it could even be. very addictive content wise, transitions through story lines very good. characters are interesting and have depth driving is good and damage physics excellent aiming is very good in 1st person and other views. cant really say enough good about the game. it does not need hype because it already has the following reasons why it is a hit... 1. best-selling action-adventure videogame in 24 hours 2. best-selling videogame in 24 hours 3. fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billion 4. fastest videogame to gross $1 billion 5. highest grossing videogame in 24 hours 6. highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours 7. most viewed trailer for an action-adventure videogame",123.6

"im sure the game is great and all but on my system it runs like crap. i have to knock down the graphic settings quite a bit and turn my resolution to 720p just to get a smooth frame rate (even then the game will crash every so often). some of my friends are having a hard time just getting the game to launch. so far im pretty disappointed. gtx 770 intel i5- 4670k 8gb of ram (im the ram might be the problem but 8gb was the recommended amount on system requirements so i dont know whats up...) and yes nvidia drivers are up to date. i really want this game to work well but im just having too many problems.",44.2

"grand theft auto, crash edition. i have a descent computer, but this game has crashed 5 times in two hours. ive adjusted the video settings to stupid low levels, and the problem still persists. until the game is stable,its no fun and nearly unplayable(thanks to no saves mid mission). stick to the console version, unless you enjoy playing the opening scene mulitple times ina row.",47.3

"i wont go into to much detail, other than to say rockstar is forgiven for the delays and for the terrible gta 4 port. gta v is one of the best pc games ever made not only in optimizations and graphics fidelity but the story and gameplay is top notch. rockstar out did themselves, anyone who pirates this game should be shot. rockstar put heart and soul into graphics optimizations. this game can run on a potatoe, while at the same time there are so many advanced graphics effects available for people with bleeding edge hardware to take full advantage of the cutting edge! well done rockstar!",66.1

"11/10 - its ok",40.9
"im very pleased with the port of this game, it runs well even on my -tier cpu. (fx-4100) the textures look great compared to the previous version i played on the last-generation consoles, even on the normal setting. the game has a very useful video memory gauge like the other rockstar ports which makes tweaking the options a cinch. i had no trouble transferring over my gta online character from the ps3 version, and the online so far hasnt given me any trouble in terms of connectivity. i did have some trouble with what seemed like mouse acceleration, and i was unable to find an option to disable it. but after changing from raw input to directinput it seems to be much better. all in all, id say it was worth the wait.",40.4
"basically a definitive version of console gta with new stuff",80.1
"worst online gaming experince i have ever had, does not work, its slow the loading screens are un godly and the player base are full of trolls and s, the single player i got stuck as franklin not able to do anything, and that was my breaking point. gta5 is a waste of money do not buy it, stick to your other games",92.9
"game is amazing! so much fun and have zero issues. looks and runs amazing in 1080p 60fps. sorry for those that cant play but you should reserve your negative reviews untill you actually play it. getting pissy in a negative review on steam isnt going to help your problems and you are just bashing an otherwise amazing game. this game is a must buy!!",43.0
"i own lots of games. this is by far the best. the introduction amazed me. in fact, i didnt even know it was the introduction it was so great! shoot some peeps, drive in my expensive car, shoot some po-pos, drive over a cliff with my expensive car, shoot some hostages. yay.",14.2
"perfect....:) best game evar.",41.3
"my first time playing gta v and im glad i waited for the pc release. was expecting a poor port, but it ended up being excellent. im running it fully maxed out on my sli setup and it looks beautiful. definitely a must play. gr8 game m8 i r8 8/8!",17.9
"i can safely say that the single player alone is worth the full price. 60 fps 1080p goodness! a lot of people had connection problems and stuff at launch today, but i did not. i have yet to play online but when i do i will edit the review. the good: your standard gta fare. you got driving, shooting and all kinds of stuff. we have the new first person mode, that is really cool, specifically when you go on your phone. you have all the past times like tennis and golf alongside the great main story and side missions. you have three main characters, each with uniques missions and stats. the missions themselves from what i have played are diverse, fun and great. the parodys of pop culture are well done, the voice acting is well done and just fun to play. the bad: not much wrong with this. i guess michaels family isnt particuarly likeable, the controls are a little strange at first and i dont know if its my keyboard or the game, but it kept on bringing up the pause menu during gameplay. on top of this, some of the cars are too loose and are floaty, which makes sharp turns annoying to pull off. the cops are hyper aggresive and the civillian drivers are ridiculously stupid. none of these things drag down the game too much though.",11.3
"game is very will otimpisted, i am capable on running on nearily full ultra/very high settings with some shadow settings disabled with 30ish fps. but that resulted in wierd shadow texture bugs. my biggest issue as of now is the drawing distance, texture pop in is nearily the same as the xbox 360 or even worse in cases and it looks nothing like the trailers.",15.2
"not being able to play this game has my name written all over it (windows user name problem).",63.1
"the best",59.6
"worth every penny, great game! runs really well on my laptop, with 40=50 fps on almost ultra!",28.4
"worth the wait. i was suspicious about this being a good port and all, but it turned out to work great, and im currently sitting on an mediocre laptop. the first person view is excellent and im glad to be playing the game with a keyboard / mouse as it should be.",97.6
"best game ever, i have 50 or something games but this takes the cake !",17.6
"fantastic game! endless fun. 3 days in and i have almost 24 hours of gameplay. still not bored of it. when i do get bored, i just go on a killing rampage to see how long i can survive against the police.",65.1
"what can i say... its grand theft auto! who wouldnt buy this?!",38.5
"great game.",16.8
"ive changed my review from negative to positive. it took 3 days, but rockstar finally fixed the bugs that made the launch day a failure. im still never preordering another game, though.",45.3
"played the xbox360 version and i thought that looked beautiful... this just makes that version look 16bit! even if you played it first time around, this is well worth it as its still one of the best games around and its now stunning looking.",16.1
"the wait was definitely worth it.",40.5
"i cannot run this game even though my computer is not particularly good this game doesnt even give it a chance. i am disapointed in this design flaw. and i was antisipating this game from the start.",1.5
"i finished gta v on ps3 upon release. i think i purchased gta 6 for pc..damn that game is just amazing, flawless running at 1080p on my alienware laptop using just a {n-vidia 770 gtx m} all settings to very high. gj rockstar",90.5
"ok i can play the game, so that is good, but there are alot of graphical errors. i.e buildings disapering. i have a gtx 970 4gb card so dont tell me i cant hande this game. i will change review once the problem is fixed",55.6
"gta online ed up to save my character, now i have ing lipgloss and fake eyebrows. 11/10",91.2

"u steam u steal my game from me",71.3
"played this on xbox 360 and i enjoyed it very much. now with editor mode and firstperson as well as mouse+ keyboard, the gameplay of gta is much more enjoyable and realistic. i highly reccommend buying this game, because this game is very addictive and very fun to play with your friends :) . glhf",30.8
"game looks and runs great at 1920x1080 with 144hz refresh rate would highly recomend this to any grand theft auto fan",72.4

"amazing game,love it when my mind is right",38.1
"10/10 amazing to play this game @60 fps. only problem is that the game crashes frequently. hopefully rockstar will patch this in the future. :d",11.3
"10/10 would pre purchase again",43.3
"by all accounts a good, well optimized game. the ui, controls are fantastic. the graphic options and graphical quality is exceptional, especially for the performance i get on low-end hardware. they really put a lot of work into optimizing this and tweaking the engine to perfection. far more than any company has anything else released in years. that is, if it runs at all. theyre dragging their feet about fixing the myriad of issues which plague many players. at this time i do not recommend buying it with a 50% chance that itll just crash repeatedly, either during the intial launch of the launcher itself, or during gameplay.",52.9
"i can without a doubt say that this is my favorite game of all time. on the ps3 ive spent over 500 hours in it, and im gonna spend even more on pc when its been upgraded so much. definitely recommend this.",48.6
"after watching the positive pc port report video totalbiscuit made i figured gta v would be a great pick up, but unfortunately i ran into so many issues rightaway that i ended up requesting a refund which was still an option due to the other problems the game had. issues i had: - jerky/laggy mouse movement in the menu. changing vsync or mouse input didnt help. - settings didnt save after quitting the game and restarting - display calibration screen on every start - benchmark crashed to desktop after a 3 minute black screen - fps tied to sensitivity (not this crap again, sigh) i run a i7-4790k, 16 gb, r9 290x machine and from what i could see from my short experience, the actual framerate ingame is fine so performance seems ok otherwise. this is the first refund ive ever requested and im glad it was still an option. fully priced games, in this case even more, should always have an option for refunds to avoid these sorts of things. one thing steam could learn from origin. i hope they patch the game and fix all these issues because i am certain the underlying game is brilliant, but i just cant support it while theres so many problems before even getting to the actual playing part.",0.8
"amazing game, rockstar obviously wanted to do the best delivery of a game they could and even if they didnt, that was achieved anyway but im sure they were. amazing graphics, better than any console graphics, 60fps makes it so much better and feel like youre actually there at times when youre in the amazing... 1st person mode! which you get on ps4 and xbox one anyway but still it looks way better on the pc. director mode makes it way better aswell because you can play as so many different characters and costumed characters which is alot of fun when bored in the game. definitely recommended (if you have a graphics card of atleast radeon hd 7770) but it might look alright on a lower one, but yeah definitely recommended!",16.4
"this game is so realistic, it taught me you can rob a convencience store with a flare gun!",55.6
"all i want to say is: the glorious pc master race 60 fps 4k 3d lord gaben",24.9
"best game of all time.",67.5
"buyer beware: if you are an average gamer that does not have more than or eaqual to 3gb graphics card the game will look horrible, you must havea graphics card to play but it must be a spendy one because the xbox 360 verson of this game looks better then the pc version for me, im so sad i wasted $60 on this hopeing for better graphics but am now out $60 and very dissapointed.",27.3
"who the hell cares about what i think its gta v",70.5
"good port, fun game. only issue ive encountered thus far is mouse acceleration and load times.",54.4

"didnt have an issue installing it. but now this game is being completely  and is opening then deciding to not respond as it loads. i already played it for 4.3 hours and now i cant play at all. its dumb as . fix this , dont release a game that isnt ready you dumb s you should know this by now. ive been a steam member for 8 years and i hate dumb little tiny issues like this.",27.9
"this game ruined my life, and here goes back again.",19.8
"been trying to play for hours, all my friends can play and me and my brother cant. when i launch up gta v nothing happens for 5 seconds not even the game opens at all, i havent even made it onto the social club part, its a pathetic waste of 40 pound.",38.5

"grand theft auto is currently my favourite game. ive mostly played online where you work your way through jobs and heists, along the way buying nice cars and sweet apartments. after playing with the graphics settings a bit, i can now play at ~55 fps on mostly maxed out settings with an r9 290x gpu. some small things that i dont like is that you are not able to transfer your single player progress from your console to your pc. i also dont like how when youre hosting a heist most of the time one person leaves half way through or just really sucks at the game, and believe me, one person makes a difference between completing a heist and failing. one time, after finally finding a good heist group we were 3 minutes from completing the heist. the guy who was piloting the helicopter crashed it. you can guess how angry we all were. i found that people are more reliable not to drop out if they have a mic and the heists are also a lot easier that way because communication is a lot better! i also love that you can hot-swap between a keyboard and a controller. you can be using the controller to drive your car around and you can quickly swap to keyboard if you need to escape on foot. investing in a controller is definately worth it. if you have a wired xbox 360 controller you can use it to play, but i am using a wireless xbox controller using an adapter i found on ebay for about $10. overall gta v is a great game both single player and online, i just wish rockstar supported mods. thanks for reading my review! if you want to join me in heists just send me a friend request through social club. my username is: e1ghtspace make sure you have a mic though, otherwise you wont really be much help (unless you use the chat, in which case feel free to send a friend request)",48.6
"man, this game really is great. its absolutely beautiful, the story is compelling, and its bigger than ever! the only problem is that..its not optimized for pc, oddly enough. it has issues using the full power of some peoples gpu, including mine. despite being able to run the game at 40-50 fps on medium high settings, you get wierd dips, stutters, and micro sound-cut outs at times, or, your fps will randomly drop to 20 and stay there for a minute, even when youre just standing still! when they release a better version ofthe game, it will have my full support. right now, im just not feelin it.",47.0

"having external accounts to link is a pain in the  and should not be approved by steam. story wise game seems interesting. scripted events make your life harder instead of easier is pretty stupid. there are memorable worth while story missions that will certainly make you smile but theyre not without their glitches and prepare for tons of stupid  to kill you. single player - good but has its glitches, had some crashing issues too. its a very beautiful game landscape wise, combat is a bit lack luster as it is mostly hide behind something, peak out, kill a guy, hide again, rinse until all are dead. they did go a good job on some missions with limited guards and very hand holding linear kill this guy, now move sort of play. like any gta most people i think play for the story and this one so far has made me smile and was pretty good. for 60 dollars the game is far better than most of the crap out there. multiplayer- as ive leveled up its become more fun and having others to play with made it even better. crashes- i have had numerous random crashes usually during loads, one of which green screened me and forced a hard restart. it might be bugs, not really sure whats causing all of the weird things, but beyond these unusual crashes/freezes the game seems pretty well optimized.",85.4

"this review is being written during the games launch, so the issues mentioned will hopefully be fixed. for me, this game is completely unplayable in its current state. i dont have issues launching the game or signing into the rockstar social club. no, my issue is getting the game to run at a playable frame rate. my exceeds both the minimum and recommended specifications for the game to run. yet, even when all graphical settings are toggled to their lowest options, i cant get the game to run at a playable frame rate. theres a ton of stuttering, frame drops and visiau lag that make the game completely and totally unplayable. ive tried rebooting my pc, making sure that i dont have unnecessary programs running in the background, and still nothing has helped. the game is installed on my ssd, so i dont think theres any issue coming from where its installed. until this is fixed and i can actually play the game, im giving this a thumbs down. i dont know why i expected anything better than this with the launch of this game... i mean, its not like rockstar talked a big game and created a lot of hype about how this game would be the smoothest launch in history because of how many times they delayed it to fix it. >.<",37.0

"- newbie to the gta series - the only gta game i ever played was the very first one that came out in 1997 on pc. i decided to buy this one due to all the hype and the much talked about graphics improvements. i have never been this satisfied paying $59.99 for a game ive barely knew anything about - much less played. the level of detail put in this game is amazing. everything from the graphics to the story line, truly impressive. this is the type of game that you dont have to worry about completing in a day. i am looking forward to playing this game for many months. there are small issues here and there that i noticed as far as bugs in the game but i anticipate they will be fixed in the near future. if you are on the fence about this game, i definitely recommend it. as a newbie to the series, i am glad i pulled the trigger on this one. funny acting, great story line, impressive graphics, tons of missions, awesome online multiplayer and it will push your high end card(s) to the limit. 9/10",57.2

"rating: awesome 8/10 gta 5 as its predecessors its a high profile game, where rockstar clearly spend lots of time and money to create an ultimate gaming experience. however there is couple goods and bads that i will point out in this review and hopefully you guys can make your own mind wether the game deserves your hard worked $$$ or perhaps its better to spend it somewhere else. i will make couple references to watch dogs as comparisment where appropriate. as most of the future gta 5 pc players most likely played that game which set a really good standard in my opinion when it comes to open world games in this genre. graphics: 8/10 r* did a great job to create good visual effects. settings plate with lots of variety of options will leave you speechless. starting where you can regulate density of cars, pedestrians to even tessalation or antialaising. anything rain, snow, sunshine looks extremly real and you will be positively blown away. on the downside, even that it is a high quality decent graphics, a much better been already shown in other similar game watch dogs in my opinions which frankly require a much powerful rig to run it on high settings than gta 5. gameplay: 8/10 the gameplay is very stable and realistic. i used to play a lot watch dogs in the past, and watch dogs was a very dynamic game, where you literally could go full commando mode, very high paced combat, movements, driving, parkour skills etc. i dont have the same feeling here in gta 5. as said earlier the game is very realistic, that feels like a time slows down a bit while comparing it to wd. it still maintain the same pace as gta 4 had, so people who jumped straight from gta 4 to gta 5 will feel like at home. but as a gta fan i certainly found no issues with switching. the combat however looks very simple, i seriously think that r* could use mechanics that were present in max payne 3. but then again...who would buy mp3 then... atmosphere/story/feeling/screenplay: 7/10 i dont quite find myself well in gta 5 world. although there is a strong interaction and history between a player and ingame characters, the game lacks some kind of signature touch that were present in for example alan wake or max payne 2 (both made by remedy and mp2 with r* partnership) where actually developers created a world that was highly interactive such as stopping by a screen to watch a video, scary music played etc. i really miss that here. but i guess its me. for all others who came purely for action, robbing banks, and ranking up in crime society - it will be a heaven. music: 10/10 both in game radio stations, cutscene and ambience music and sounds are great. huge variety of genres to listen to, r* never failed here. amazing job. and of course own mp3 radio station. cant wait for frag radio plugin ;) final thoughts: as a next installment in gta generation, the game delivers the high quality game which you will enjoy for hours. i hope my review will be me helpful to you to decide wheter you should get the game. but i will say this: that game should be on your bucket list for sure.",23.3
"better than the majority of game launches these days, 10/10",64.1
"problems i currently have with gta 5 - loading delay when the game launches - resolution changing from fullscreen to windowed - built in benchmark program does not work properly - graphics stuttering, especially when driving - some textures and objects loading at a slow pace which result in blurred images on the screen ive updated to the amd experimental drivers for gta 5, which helped a lot. im disappointed in amd, they need to make better drivers and churn them out at a faster pace for big game launches. switching to lower graphics improves the fps, but doesnt remove the stuttering. so once again im in this waiting game for bug fixes. the sad thing is this is rockstar games best port they have done for the pc recently. both max payne and la noire had more problems at launch, but eventually those games ran very smooth for me on high settings. shame on rockstar for the mediocre port, shame on amd for the mediocre drivers, and shame on me for pre-ordering again from a publisher with a history of pc launch problems. this game is great, ive played in on ps3 and i really want to play it on pc and change this to a positive review :(",2.3

"10/10 amazing graphics, the ammount of attention rockstar put into every minor detail is mind blowing. i would highly reccomend this game running on a i7 4770k and a gtx 980 g1, and it runs so smoothly. i spent the first hour walking around and looking for flaws in programing and in the game world itself i.e glitchy walls,, misanimations. havent found anything yet. the game world is so alive! i rode the subway, walked around a realistic baseball field, and while i was exploring some rooftops(the parkour reminds me of mirrors edge which is a good thing) i heard get on the ground! so i went to investigate and see cops starting to arrest a guy before he pulled a gun and a firefight ensued. they killed him and the cops moved so lifelike. love it! great job rockstar!",22.3
"this is pc porting / optimizing at its best, and most patient. this is what the community expects from a developer that delays a title, for it to be as complete a pc experience as possible, and have dimminished a sense of it being made for something inferior. rockstart has accomplished that w/ gta5 - its an amazing to look at experience, and it runs flawlessly. we all already know how great the content and story is, so ill leave this review as is. its a great game on the pc. it truly is the ultimate edition.",50.0

"huge game doesnt do it justice. great graphics, top-notch gameplay, and tons of stuff the average person wont ever do. third-person action game, with first-person thrown in as well, that uses a three-person main character storymode all about heists, revenge and the like. multiplayer is a blast, with buying apartments, cars, and weapons with the objective being what you want to do. you can race, heist, deathmatch, or just enjoy the fanastic chaos that will ensue!",4.7
"ps4 version looks and runs better. it can feel nice for a bit at 60fps but frequent frame drops destroy the experience. there is also a very restrictive graphics options menu, as in you can change the options but the game will not let you play the game if it thinks you are out of memory. this can happen often as the game does not pick up on multiple graphics cards and large amounts of ram. a better port than gtaiv but its still not a high enough quality to warrant purchasing this version. only buy if you have a rig way above the reccomended settings and can afford a new hard drive because this is a resource hog and a disgusting large game to install. all in all the order for gta v goes ps4/xbone > pc >360/ ps3.",1.4

"runs very nicely on my i5/r9 290 machine. a lot of people reporting various problems on opening day, but my install and day 1 gameplay (both story mode and gta online) went off without a hitch. looking forward to how well this game will look as further optimization and bug fixes come along. this is the way gta was meant to look. as far as the gameplay goes, im fairly new to the gta universe and i did my first online heist today. good fun. recommended! edit: dont forget to update your gpu drivers! both amd and nvidia have made adjustments for this game!",60.4
"a really good port. i have an i5 second gen with a gtx770 (2gb) and 8gbs of ram and i cun run it with high-ultra settings at 1080p 60fps (with only fxaa, cant afford fancier msaa with the way i fine-tuned). you will have to fiddle around with a few things in order to get the really nice textures (if you have a 770), but all other graphics options are easy to pull off. it would probably look a lot like a slightly better 1080p version of the 360 and ps3 versions if you only have 1gb of vram though, since the textures make a huge difference from normal to high. pretty much it though. plenty of settings to fine tune. rockstar is making sure that you have the control here. the story and gameplay are great, never repetitive and the story missions use everything from the sky to the bottom of the ocean of san andreas to keep you entertained. played the ps3 version and its the same here. if you havent played gta v at all yet, youre missing out on the best gta game. first-person is surprisingly solid. im enjoying it more than i thought. the rockstar editor and director mode are insanely fun. overall very pleased. if you noticed i said nothing negative about the game in this review its because i really cant think of anything for this release. im glad rockstar decided to take their time because its a great pc game out of the box.",22.7

"i never expected to enjoy gta v after how dispointing it was in 2013 when it released on xbox 360 and ps3. the biggest problems with those versions was the abysmal framerate and that the game took away actual gameplay with auto-aim. im very pleased by the above average pc port that rockstar gave to this title. this game is far more comparable to the ps4 / xbone versions as the graphics have been increased, with the addition of first person mode. the better graphics and framerate really show that this is the definitive edition of the game that for some reason took way longer than it should have.",21.0

"the ultimate version of gtav! ive already played the heck out of this game on ps3...beaten the story and played mp...everyone pretty much knows that this is a great game chock full of goodness in an open world scenario. the pc does the consoles one better with glorious hd graphics with low system requirements. my experience thus far on pc has been smooth as buttah with zero hiccups or flaws. my rig is not even high end, and the only current thing i have in it my graphics card. regardless, im able to crank out a smooth 50 to 60fps in all but the most intensive scenes where it drops to 40fps occasionally using max settings. i7-920 24gb crucial ram evga x58 sli evga gtx 780 ti black 2tb wd black hd 1920x1080rez max all settings (3gb vram used) the added improvements are what make this the ultimate version. i spent an hour of the 4 hours playing so far just screwing around in director mode. it is so much with basically built in cheats to let you be the fanatic youve always dreamed about. doing massive jumps and crazy crashes just to record the best scenes you can make. theres no doubt there are going to be some impressive videos coming out soon. to keep this short, rockstar did a commendable job on this game, and the port is lovingly done. a huge difference from gtaivs release, its obvious they paid attention. yes, there are teething problems, but overall this game is worth the money and your investment. it will provide absolutely hours of entertainment. just wait for the mods!",24.6

"for 567 days the only things i knew about gta5 were from rockstars trailers. i purposely deprived myself of all gameplay videos. i avoided reviews. i abandoned friends who were playing it. if i was a catholic priest out on parole for sexual abuse, gta5 was a scantily clad altar boy. as far as i was concerned, it didnt exist until it existed on pc. unlike many i have faith in rockstar and since its probably safe to assume their developement team doesnt consist entirely of an army of helen keller clones theyve heard pc gamers whining about ports for years. so, what was the result of my gta5 sensory deprivation? well, i spent the first hour with the game walking around in first person with my mouth agape until my tongue began to feel and look like a pink raisin. at first with completely maxed settings at 2720x1530, but my rig was showing its age a bit (watercooled 4.05ghz xeon x3360, 8gb ddr2, 2gb 7870xt tahiti le @ 1.2/1.6ghz) so i set tessellation on normal and knocked shadows down as well as took one knotch off view distance and was satisfied with a consistent 45-50fps and by far the most beautiful and detailed game ive ever seen, as well as one of the most well optimized. but then, a sort of disappointment crept in as i was driving around with a 360 controller. why am i driving with a gamepad when i have a logitech g27 right in front of me? as a spoiled pc gamer, even with this digital masterpiece i found myself wanting a little more. my attempt at solution was x360ce, and the next 2 hours were spent trying to get it to work. after nearly giving up i realized that gta5 is a 64-bit game which needed the x360ce 64-bit libraries. bingo im kind of a genius! once x360ce 64-bit was installed, i heard the cheerful ding of the xinput hook when i booted gta5 back up and began driving around los santos with my g27!!! as a bonus, i actually got the vibration working in x360ce for the first time ever, so not only am i driving with my wheel in gta5, i am also feeling bumps in the road. pair this with a pair of beyerdynamic dt-770 noise cancelling headphones and i am completely immersed in los santos with little concern for the real world. rockstar, you have outdone yourselves and i love you. if anyone ever questioned whether or not video games are a true art form gta5 proves that it is. in fact, id go beyond that and say if you offered me the next 5 years with my only posession being the actual mona lisa or gta5 i would not only choose gta5, but would help you cram that terribly stupid juxtaposition deep into your nether regions so i could be left to my current objective of growing a full neckbeard and avoiding the outdoors. tl;dr: buy this. now. stop debating it and buy it. have a steering wheel? download x360ce 64-bit so you can lose yourself driving around the most beautiful and immersive city ever realized in a game.",191.6

"pc master race has waited years to get our hands on this game. the real question is was this game worth the wait? initially the game plays fantastically i basically had zero issues with the port. the game is very immersive, beautiful, and quite a bit of fun. the only issue is as you progress on into the game (33% completion singleplayer blitz heist) the game really starts to show its true colors. game crashes over and over again on this mission basically halting all your progress. i had to look up online a potential fix for this issue. which requires you to park in some really asinine place so when it warps from franklin to michael the game doesnt freeze up requiring you to start completely over again. beyond that mission there are several other somewhat game breaking bugs which will freeze up the game completely halting progress, and requiring you to start over which is really really annoying. the last annoying thing i want to address is the whole stock market integration. want to lose all your money that you preordered use the stock market in offline mode. it will allow you to buy stocks but then your money will just disappear into thin air when you want to see whats happened to it. this happened to me with basically all my preorder dlc money. that money will never be returned by rockstar especially with their little shark cards that they want people to buy. i still like rockstar as a company, and i am well aware this game will be fixed eventually. but my experience thus far doesnt justify a buy because these types of bugs shouldnt ship with a aaa title. requiring players to find work arounds for glaring mission issues this early in the titles release with no fix in sight just seems lazy. we shouldnt be your quality control testers when the game took this long to port to pc. i rate this game a 6.5/10 with a do not buy until these single player issues are fixed. current rig: i5-4690 16 gb ram 770 gtx 4 gig asus z97-a motherboard",9.3

"this game is obviously one of the best gtas ever created. rather than tell you whats good about it (because the list is way too long), ill tell you where the game is lacking. the story for this game is very clich. there are no exciting twists to the story and its very predictable. think of an action movie from the 90s and thats your story here. the story started to pick up in the middle but then it seemed like they forgot about the buildup and they just went straight into the game. i didnt feel that transition i always felt with other gtas. another thing that this game forgot was activities. there are no police car missions and not as many interior buildings that gta iv had. i personally enjoyed walking into a burger shot and i was disappointed when i realized you couldnt visit any food places. sprunk machines are still there to give you health, but i prefer eating at an establishment like in san andreas or gta iv. the map itself is a decent size but one thing it lacks is dead space. im talking about the empty desert we experienced in san andreas; that feeling of being lost in the middle of nowhere. you dont get that with this game. every single part of the map is populated with roads, buildings or people. the only secluded areas i could find were the mountains (which werent that big, to be honest). the way the map was made removes a bit of the realism for me: its just a big island in the middle of the ocean. that, and the lack of dead space was unfortunate but one thing they did right was the underwater segment of the game. ever wrestle a shark? when you can in gta v! dont be dissuaded by my pessimistic review. keep in mind that this game is freakin amazing. so amazing that i just had to point out some of the flaws of it. the flaws are few with this game. gta online is still somewhat buggy but if you can get past that, you will enjoy another 50-100 hours off that. 8.5/10 - a technical and artistic wonder of the gaming world on par with skyrim.",32.3

"ive never played gta v on other devices, didnt really see much footage of it till the day before the pc release and it was everything from how solid the port was to how much they did right and how great its gonna be. im a fan of gta though ive avoided it since gta iv, that was a mixed bag and just didnt give me the same fun 2,3,vc had. ive played a bit and ill separate them by general and online. so, keep that in mind that i only played a few hours of sa and while i beat 4, i also would happily never play it again. general: this port, unlike gtaiv is amazing, they have a lot of options to tweak and adjust, from very in depth graphical options, sound options, you can use mouse & keboard or switch to a controller- on the fly. so if you like driving/flying with a controller but shooting with a mouse and kb? easily done! everyone has always wondered what gta would be like in first person, obvious from the mods some have made and installed, now its in the game by default and they went all out. get into a car and youre treated to- not some floating cam on the hood of the car but a fully modeled interior of the car! in first person you can run around and do everything as normal, and theres an option to switch to 3rd person if you use cover. graphically the game is wildly pretty, as stated car interiors are fully modeled and look great, theres a variety of areas to visit with different areas. the map is huge, its not just cause 2 huge but its impressively large. runs at 60fps at 1080p with everything mostly on highest (exceptions being not putting every aa option on, pc specs at end of review) online: this is hit or miss, you start out making a character with a unique styled character creator which ...while neat, makes the process more complicated than it needs to be. heres what i hated: i played with some random people for a few hours and i would charitably describe them as lively. being called several names over voice then attacked, then again more name calling- and youll be defending yourself a lot too because rockstar thought itd be in your best interest to point out all players actively on the mini-map and map. so if you want to just try and do some things and theres 1 jerk? he can hunt all players down. they do mark people who do this by making their dot more and more red and good players are encouraged to hunt them, but its not any less annoying. only made worse by how fast you die, im sure this was more geared how it was on console where using sticks was a bit harder to aim but with a mouse you can kill a player in a few bullets, a headshot being instant from what i could tell. so, guy power slides over, stops for just long enough to shoot you in the face, drive to where you spawned and try it again, while each death being followed by some uncreative insult or you blow his face off and blow his tires out. what i liked: thankfully you can make private matches with friends or alone, you can even still have players online hop into events such as racing if you let them into the event/not your world. so you can easily avoid pub matches, but still play online with full access to deathmatches being put up and whatever. you can even start matches and make them public from your private world. once you end it, youll be dropped back into your own area. in events they tell what control scheme each player is using mouse/controller and you can limit the game to who can use what or not. to put it simply, you can find a lot in this game because you can do so freaking much. want to play story missions? go for it. death match with friends or randoms? sure. play tennis with friends? pool? race jets? arm wrestle? race? steal cars, hunt, shoot eachother on the street, hunt bounties, kill innocents, buy property, single player, multiplayer. yeah, a lot for you to decide, its a top quality port to boot so i cant say enough about this game. regardless of where you buy this game you will need the rockstar social club, keep that in mind. drm over drm, kinda dumb...okay its very dumb, but heres hoping it keeps cheaters down... intel i7 4770k 3.5ghz 8gb ram geforce gtx 970 windows 8.1 64bit",30.1

"of all the millions of games out there, very very few can be perfect, flawless and deserve an undoubtable full score. and gta v is one of these games, that should be remembered in the history of gaming, and deserve as much fame and recognition as titles such as zelda : ocarina of time and portal 2. this is my review in short. to those unfamiliar with gta, these are some of the things you can do in this game: * walk, run, stealth, swim, parachute * bikes, cars, boats, yachts, planes, helicopters, fighters * fight hand-to-hand, or with bats/knives * pistols, shotguns, machine guns, rifles, minigun, rpgs, grenades, bombs * exercise to raise strength/health/shooting skill/driving skill * play tennis/golf * cop chase * direct, shoot and share videos * lengthy single player campaign * massive online campaign * in short: anything and here are some of the improvements from gta iv: * 3 playable characters instead of 1 * improved hud that takes less space and shows more info * ability to replay previous missions and challenge extra missions objectives * ability to retry mission from midway after failure * more to be found... i do have one complaint for the single player campaign: the very first mission contains shooting scenes, that used to appear only after several missions in previous games. i worry that later missions may become much harder. for now though, it should be no problem. in conclusion, this is the ultimate game to be created. 10 out of 10, masterpiece.",5.8
"at the moment the console version is better there is alot of issues. i have never once played without some sort of issue. its either a graphic error, the game minimizing and not opening, randomely freezing but i can still hear sounds around me, or it wont even launch. 2 years and the only thing different is the number of players and the graphics its kinda dissapointing atm.",21.3

"(warning mild story spoilers!) grant theft auto v? whats that you might ask. its basicly an open world game where you commit crimes in sp (singleplayer) or mp (multiplayer). the game has been out on xbox 360 and playstation 3 from 17th of september 2013. -wow, thats a long time ago, your thinking. well it is a long time ago, i agree. then on november 18th 2014 gta v hit playstation 4 and xbox one. the graphical upgrade was so big i couldnt belive my eyes when i saw it. then rockstar announced gta v coming to pc on the 27th of january 2015 but it got delayed till march and then agian to 14th of april. now the spoilers begin! grand theft auto v is a part of the well known grand theft auto series. it tells you a story about 3 men, franklin clinton, a street hustler that lives in his aunts house in south los santos (los santos is a parody remake of los angeles), michael de santa, a rich retired bank robber and a bad familyman. that lives in vinewood, north los santos. and trevor philips, well waht can i say about him, he is psychopathic drug dealer that lives in sandy shores, a far away from the noisy los santos. these men are trying to pull of heists. and that my friend is not even the start. then there is the multiplayer: grand theft auto online, where rockstar is developing bunch of new content (did i mention they are free) for the players to enjoy. in a nutshell its a realistic crime sim in sp or mp. i would rate it 9.6/10 -absolutely fantastic! pros and cons: pros: -good graphics -very immersive - good storyline -good multiplayer -voiced very good cons: -7 year-olds driving in tanks spawn killing everyone in mp -not that much difference from the ps4 and the xone so what are you waiting for, buy the game now!",24.3

"i have returned to the world of grand theft auto after about 5 years away and boy am i pleased to be back! it has been such a long wait for this title but to be honest it was worth the wait. first off, if you dont have a decent graphics card, i am afraid you will have to stump up the cash to get one. secondly, you do need a decent pc to run this as this isnt your second grade port from a console - a lot of work has gone into the pc version of this game and it does show. as i have a 360 controller connected to my pc, it has been very useful. however, there are very few hints to help you master the controls from the start of the game. you have to fumble around and experiment for a little bit to ensure you know what to do and how to do it when the time calls for it. it took a few goes on the first level of the single player part of the game to get used to the controls. however, once you master the controls on a gaming pad, it is a very engaging game and it really does pay dividends. the single player version of the game is incredibly engaging - you can play a number of different characters and work your way up the ranks (just like any gta game). the cars are beautiful and the ai characters are wonderfully unpredictable. i do like the way you can stumble into a fight or pickpocket and you can save the day. it is great and you do feel part of the gta world. the story keeps you hooked and the way you can interract with the other characters is fully rewarding. the multiplayer part of the game can be a bit hit or miss. you join servers with people from all over the world and you can see other players stutter across the map. however, once you find a good server, you can either join various missions and games or you can explore the gta world and shoot the other players that have joined. once you work your way up the ranks, more things are unlocked and you can do various other things. the multiplayer version of the game is really geared up for players to connect and help each other. you can join gangs and cause a lot of chaos. to wrap up this review, a lot of issues that pc gamers may have could be related to inferior pcs or operating systems but to be honest i have had very very few technical issues with this game. it is a solid console port and i am really glad that i waited for rockstar to deliver a fantastic game which i will enjoy in years to come.",11.8

"most of the negative comments i have observed have had to do with either the game not running on certain video cards or the drm policies that rockstar have enforced. i cant say much about the video card situation, but as far as the drm policies with rockstars social club i have few problems. yes, if you are someone who moves a lot or lives in an area where an internet connection is difficult to maintain then you should probably not buy this game, but if you are like me and are gifted wtih an internet connection of a major city you should definitely buy this game. the single player is amazing by itself and offers great story, gameplay and one of the best life simulators you could ever buy. there is so much content and so many things to do that i honestly have probably not done half of them and i have spent 30+ hours on the game. the online mode is a bit of a mixed bag though. free mode, as always, is a blast and the best part of the online experience. on the other hand, the missions, hiests, tdm and every other scripted or standard online feature are painfully average after the first few times playing through them. hiests are difficult to set up through online and often will take so much time due to how hard (i call it unfair) the hiests can be at times. this leads to an even bigger problem relating to money and leveling. the money required to buy, upgrade and get the best gear, buildings and everything else is excessive at best and the only viable way to make money is to do the painfully average missions over and over again. the leveling is also a huge barrier to any of the really cool stuff the game has to offer as its all barred behind player levels. this takes hours upon hours of grinding the most boring part of the online experience. its really hit or miss with the online where if it hits you will be having one of the funnest online experiences you have ever had and if it misses you will have one of the most average/boring onine experiences you have ever had. its collectivly a 9/10 that peaks at 10/10 with freemode and singleplayer (a majority of my time with the game) and dips to 5/10 with the boring online missions (a minority of my time spent with the game). thankfully the boring online modes are not a huge part of the whole game and you will spend most of your time in freemode and singleplayer. p.s. change the flight controls if you are using mouse and keyboard, the default is truly awful with the num pad.",47.2

"update the last one: after playing this game online for many hours, i can conclude with no uncertainty that this game is not for me, and is a step down from gta 4. in fact, the only reason i have been playing it really is because of the first person mode, and no other reason. the driving in this game is possibly the worst in any gta game (console or handheld) to date. why? because the car is either fixed to the ground and skids all over the place, or it is in the air and floating with moon jump. i think the only reason why rockstar added the ability to control your car in the air like in a cart racer was because of how bad the driving mechanics are. in gta 4, it was tricky to drive at first, but when you learned how to do it, it felt the most satisfying, and even if you crashed, you were rewarded with a great damage model system and instead of the car instantly blowing up, you could survive rolling accross the floor and get up. the driving is so bad that the monster trucks feel more like inflatable balloons instead of big heavy metal vehicles. if you drive over a pebble on the sand with one slowly, it turns the monster truck at a 90 degree angle and tumbles it over! the loading is also terrible in multiplayer. instead of a static loading screen the game just zooms around the map and and loads all the time. the game is delibrately wasting your precious time for no reason. the multiplayer invite system is also annoying, invites always pop up on the screen and annoy you, and whn you are the host if you try to invite people it almost always never works out because peopel keep leaving and joining, and i have better things to do with my time than wait to be lucky enough to have enough players to play with. the most fun i had with this game is by running around online and shooting people and their cars, and evading the police by climbing up buildings and hiding. but some of the games major mechanics are so infuriating at times, it really puts me off playing. also, i use a ps3 pad, but the mouse controls are a bit off in this game. it feels like there is some input lag. the game gives you 3 control options; directinput, windows and raw inuput, but they all have the issue. the pc port is great and it has lots of options, but the game just isnt for me personaly. before the game worked for me: see that notice up there? the one that says some users are experiencing issues with there windows account names? ignore it, that isnt why most people cant play the game properly, thats just to make people ignore the negative reviews. the steam install folder of gtav does not even have playgtav.exe in it. the social club app has no fps cap. the drm stops me from playing the game because it cant connect or something. i only have one gpu, disable it and then rockstart social club says error initialising directx 9 and from people who have started playing the game? there are crashes, graphical issues, optimisation issues, and sometimes connectivity issues. but all positive reviews fail to mention these quirks, becasues theyre to busy playing the game. if you like clicking safe mode over and over again for 1 and a half hours, then get this game, it is the best ever for that. but if you want to play gtav then wait until there is a fix. they had close to seven years, according to them. and they dont even give steam the right files or something. how much money has steam made in the ladt 48 hours, selling mortal combat and gtav, both of which for many dont even start? why??!!!!!! [cries ] there is no gabe... tl:dr: cant play the game, cause the launcher says that gta has closed un-expectedly everytime i click play on steam. ill update the review later if the game starts to work at all. update: go to this forum thread to fix your game if you have error code c0000007 or something like that. title [ post here if you cant play the game ] managed to fix it with somoe help off of the internet. so far so good, not one crash yet. chomps ball physics are phenomenol, best  in a videogame ever! update number 2: after investing hours into the single player mode, the game crashed while on a heist when switching characters. when i load in to play again, the missions wont trigger anymore, making the whole game unplayable. soooo...... theres that too.",77.3

"great port performance wise sadly multiplayer wise its a straight port of the console miniature scale networking. want 15v15 deathmatches? good luck the auto mm puts you into a 2v2 or 3v3. there is no lobby to find the full games, the console mm that was straight ported to pc puzzles together these 3v3 matches exclusively. gta iv did multiplayer better than gta v for pc.... can you believe that?",104.9
"definitely worth waiting!",47.6
"this is a very large game with a lot of features, so ill split into 4 sections. pros and cons for gta v and online, respectively. gta v (offline) pros: 1. you get excellent graphics. (+5) 2. the story is definitely better than gta iv, so expect a little more fun out of that. (+5) 3. you can replay any mission at (almost) any time. good for those going for 100%. (+5) 4. wide selection of vehicles, from a blimp to a golf cart. (+6) 5. well written, it is stable from what ive seen (though there is an annoying bug with certain gpus) (+7) 6. controls are somewhat intuitive and easy to learn, but the settings in the game are poorly organized. for example, i cannot check what key swims upwards, so i have to keep drowning myself trying to figure out which one it is. (+2) cons: 1. excellent graphics also means youll need high-end equipment to play it. its also poorly optimized, so it almost feels like it was made to sell graphics cards. (-3) 2. the story is written better, but it actually feels like a recycled gta iv with slightly improved graphics and a different map and a small assortment of other features. (-5) 3. the mission rating system is a perfectionists nightmare. (-4) 4. the wide selection of vehicles is nice, but obtaining them proves very difficult. theres also many things that are overpriced, such as car modifications. (-6) 5. its massive. it could easily be better compressed, but its not. so expect to budget as much as 100gb for this game. (-5) 6*. on some gpus, the game refuses to start, requiring you to start the game with integrated graphics instead. (-1) overall, its a solid addition to the gta series. (+30/-24) gta online pros: 1. play with people around the world, nuff said. (+6) 2. private servers, for just you and your friends (+8) 3. heists and vehicles that you can keep, as well as a somewhat efficient heist-management system. (+10) cons: 1. performance. this is an online game, so i expect to lose some frames, but dropping from 45fps to 15fps, sometimes fluctating up to 20 gets very annoying very quickly. (-6) 2. it will randomly crash your entire game, requiring a restart. this is usually during a mission. (-6) 3. poor security. there is almost no cheat-protection on any of the servers, so hackers very easily give themselves unlimited health and money in online mode. (-9) 4. poor community. this could easily be fixed by implenting some sort of kick/ban system, so why not add it? (-2) i would treat the online mode as more of a bonus, and not as a reason to buy it.(+24/-23) all in all, i wouldnt reccomend it except on sale. most of the issues i listed are fixable. this game doesnt feel very finished. while graphically impressive, it technically is not. $60 is too much to pay for an unfinished game. *only mobile gpus (laptops) experience this, and there is a workaround, though it is very tedious.",9.5

"i have been loving everything that rocstar is doing since the first time i inserted a floppy disk with grand theft auto into my ibm 286. it was awesome with detail back then and it is awesome in detail today. you hardly ever hear 2 pedestrians with the same voice acting (and what an acting too!), the car engine does cooling down sounds, the hippie scumbags come out at night to chill on the beach, every area has its own role for the npcs and they act according to it. the wheather and lighting changes are stunning and this all comes with an amazing 90 frames per second. yes gta v has some technical issues that get quickly fixed. but then again think of any other developer for a minute. any other game that would try to be even close to such detail would have constant pain in running it in such good fps and overall stability. well done rockstar, yet another standard has been set by you for other developers to struggle towards. that being said, sadly i have to come to the negative. i am not bothered by my gfx970 replay recording crashing the game now and then. also i am not bothered by weird glitches, rare ones, but still they happen. i am however bothered by the amount of hackers and the lack of countermeasure for them. people are running around in deathmatches, not dieing and whats more - advertising their websites where one could buy a hack for the game. now i understand that hackers are whats to be with any game at any given time but for a company pulling this kind of money this is unacceptable. i mean people are teaching in a public game how to use cheat engine for this and that. now back to the positive...heists. oh hell yes the heists! this is exactly what i expected gta v online to be. i am so looking forward for more and more concept like this just ... just well done! overall, i have gta v on my ps4 and now on pc and its just so much better on pc. still every now and then i get on my couch and enjoy a nice massacre online with my ps4. some things id like to underline: hackers! deal with this issue please before anything else! kuruma is overpowered! regular missions make no sense anymore. either give the ai explosives or nerf the kuruma down. it kills the game. crew and friends auto-teaming is off. way off. i hardly ever get in the same team with my friends on a deathmatch. enable indoors deathmatches asap! this was a beautiful aspect to the game. instead of going mental on the streets i could just enjoy a nice little massacre in the fib building. bottom line - if you are considering to buy the game then just stop thinking now and join the online sensation! bring a friend - its just way too much fun for your friends to miss having with you.",93.2

(unable to start gta v, please reinstall) ===> keep in mind, reinstalling takes about 14-18 hours via steam -> didnt reinstall, restarted the pc 3 times then it worked for a few minutes -> played online crashin every 10-30 minutes -> found out that u r able to see statistics. how many player killed, time played, time for every session ===> average time spend per session: 20 minutes ===> i like the idea that rockstar has statistic how often my game crashes per hour and its obviously every 20 minutes ===> when u play heists which sometimes take 2 hours with 4 players in the game, u begin to cry uncontroled and fapping at the same time when ur game crashes tip for the crashers if your game crashes permanently: change graphic direct x 11 to direct x 10 and put off fxaa and mxa. then my game only crashes every 1 - 3 hours. actualy social club is offline so 6/10 for this game because i even keep on playin when its crashin every 20 minutes then i begin fapping and crying",71.3

"there are few things that pisses me off in gta v but the most annoying is time after death! yes, when you die your screen gets gray and with big wasted leathers ower it and it lasts 3 seconds.... i am playing this game only to enjoy in good ragdolls after death but here i cant even enjoy in that 3 sec. thats big minus to this game in my opinion. other negative stuff from game: - cops insta kill you usually, 1 shot from 10+ m and your gone from full hp - some bushes are indestructible and can stop every vehicle from full speed (it will stop airplane in place...) - in gta5 online many parts of game are missing, like animals, taxi... - in gta5 online all players are shown in map so you cant sneak up on someone or play without stalkers",30.2
"tl;dr: after spending three days trying to get it to work i succeeded and had the most fun ive had in ages so it took me a while to actually get to play this game due to problems which to this moment i still think were graphics related and i had to uninstall various programs to get it to finally run. once i did however it ran so smoothly, and as far as i have found so far there are is one game breaking bug on the first online heist that required me to restart the game in order to progress, which considering that this is a port of a game that was released about a year ago does mean i take issue with especially with the delays to polish the game. personally i still think they were right to delay as i dread to think what condition this game would be in had it not been polished and optimized as i have criticized developers for releasing a clearly unfinished mess on several occasions and it shows the care they put into this game if anything. game play wise i havent gotten far in the story yet as most of my time has been spent online with friends but from what i have played it is fairly entertaining so far and i can see it being more entertaining as the game progresses. online however is a blast and if i was to recommend any part of this game it would be...the whole thing, the single player is fun enough but when you add friends to the mix and random people, it gets a whole lot more hilarious",67.5

"cannot really thumbs this down, but be warned depending on what you run this on, i am not sure if it is for everyone. but be warned this game has its issues, i have gotten in cars, and had it glitch to where i couldnt look any further than a few inches right or left. so far, nothing game breaking, but sometimes you have to restart the game. as i said, unsure if everyone experiences this, but i have had a good few issues with glitches. my major complaint is the online is better than the story mode, but has a good few issues in the pc version. my reviews are not popular because they are unbiased, and i actually tell others what i experience. here goes. there are some graphical issues, at least for me, or at least for people on low settings. youre getting about what the ps3 does. but with greater draw distance. medium would be a ps3, with a slight upscaling, and the rest are getting into ps4, xbox one, and then youre pretty much beating consoles entirely after that. for me on low/medium, jagged edges are the main complaint, now the next part, i am filing under, graphical/glitches as to i do not know if they are just glitches, or maybe glitches due to low quality, i do not know, other players say the game is glitchy, and i do not know their specs.i have shot cops, they glitched out of the drivers seat, then their partner materialized in the drivers seat. so the car was never incapacitated by the drivers death, or at least slowed down. so they just keep pursuing you. sometimes, your view can glitch, at least on my set up, or low settings, i do not know if everyone experiences this, you know fanboys will like it just because it is a pc version, it is good for a port. but it needs some good patchwork. some times your view will  side ways, and mess up your visual orientation. some of these things are simply fixed sometimes, sometimes you have to restart. please give the developers credit, but if anyone else experiences any similar issue, please criticize them for it, so that they may fix this, or people with a similar issue will know their build is to blame. i just got into pc gaming a year ago, and even i can tell you this needs some work, but could be an amazing game with some polishing. next, the online has these similar issues, sometimes the connection seems to have issues as well. i do not know if the connection issues, and being disconnected is something everyone experiences, due to bad programming, and servers. or if my internet is terrible. but the game seems to lag occasionally. this game is great. but these issues, if everyone is experiencing them, and one thing everyone does experience ruins this game. the community. when youre doing missions, or simply just want to get some cash, you can rest assured everyone will shoot and kill you. ignore the, 10/10, would trust the pc community again crap, the community is barely better than console, if at all. you just get shot half of the time, and the other half maybe you enjoy the game. buy with caution, i only bought because of create a character, create a heisting group. stuff like that. i dont really like gta, and thought all of them but vice city stunk. till this one. buy at your own discretion, i would say it is great for shooter lovers, and people who like sandbox games, that are open, with a lot of choice. it is a very lengthy download, expecially depending on your internet. just buy with caution, no games for windows live this time, but there are still issues, unless this is pertaining to my build, but others complained of the same issues.",37.5
"i bought this game originally on its initial launch day, for ps3, at almost exactly the stroke of midnight. i played the crud out of it, beating the single-player without cheats or guides and landing over 80% completion for my troubles (i wouldve gotten to 100%, still without cheats or guides, but gta online cut that venture short). so why would i pony up the $60 to buy it again on pc? simply put, gta v is the best game ever made. and this isnt something i say lightly. the missions are intelligent, well-planned, hilarious, and even sometimes thought-provoking. the gameplay is carefully engineered and entirely meshed out. theres easily a solid 100+ hours of gameplay in single-player alone. and the game world is nothing short of spectacular. if youve seen a more fascinating, finely-detailed, and mind-bogglingly massive game world in another game, id love to hear what it is, because to the best of my own knowledge, it simply doesnt exist. gta online is almost insultingly fun. thats a strange word to use there, i know. but youll be insulted by a number of other game developers who failed to deliver experiences like this in the past. its a proper mmo, built around the famed gta gameplay, and its quite easy to get lost in such an immersive experience. i dare say that of all the mmos, for me anyway, this has been the greatest of the day-slayers. coming into this from playstation 3, and having watched extensive videos online of gameplay from ps4/ xb1, i can confidently say that the pc version blows the others straight out of the water in the graphics and audio department. but thats to be expected from the glorious pc master race, of course. no console can hold a candle to the raw power of the pc. having said that, there are a few hiccups with this version, when compared to the ps3 version. for starters, aircraft controls with keyboard and mouse are simply the very worst of any game, ever. if you have a controller, as i do, thats not a big deal. but flying controls are seriously terrible and rockstar should feel ashamed for how poorly-planned this aspect of gameplay is. worse still, you cant use a joystick, so this game will cost you an additional $3 so you can buy a feather duster, in order to keep your fancy-pants saitek x52 in good standing. why this game doesnt allow for joystick input for flying is well beyond anyone. huge oversight there, rockstar. but the biggest beef i have with the pc version? so far, rockstar havent made any efforts toward helping out the modding community, presumably in an effort to curb cheating in gta online. of course, this would be easily solved if theyd just rent out modded servers to players and create separate characters for those servers -- no cheating, rockstar gets paid, we get mods, everyone wins -- but somehow no one at their studio has come up with this remarkably simple solution yet. all told, despite the few issues the game has, gta v is, in my opinion, the best game ever made. it checks every single box. excellent gameplay, a brilliant story, immersive online play, hundreds of hours worth of gameplay, breathtaking graphics and audio, tons of aesthetic and interactive detail, the freedom to explore and stuff to find when you do... this game offers everything ive ever wanted out of a game, and then some. i just wish i could use my flippin joystick while experiencing it all.",85.9

"the game is great! the story is solid and having three characters that you switch from keeps it interesting to the end. everything runs smoothly from the vehicles, the gunfights, to the cutscenes. iaughed out loud (a lot) and im only 30% through the story. tons of stuff to do aside from the story giving the offline a decent replay value. online is a lot better when played with people you know. otherwise it feels like youre being raced to the objective and left behind. instead of an empty free roam like iv. you can take on missions and other activities throughout l.s. giving you an actual reason to play other than just messing around. speaking of just messing around... you will get a lot of people trolling players trying to complete certain activities. for example, i was holding up a store for some quick cash. the clerk emptied the register and i exited the store. little did i know a player had been waiting the whole time to kill me as soon as i stepped out. he didnt get anything for doing it other than the satisfaction of killing a distracted player. there are repercussions for doing this. the more you kill civies or damage property a mentality meter will rise. the higher the meter the bigger the price for your head. players can hunt you and gain xp/cash for the kill. continually killing other players (other than competitive matches) will earn you the title bad sport. as long as you have this title you will only be able to play with other bad sports. having the good sport title will earn you rewards randomly. in other words... dont be a . online matches are very diverse. from all kinds of racing to deathmatches, tennis, darts, arm wrestling, and the list goes on and on. if you are returning from the ps3/360 version. there isnt a lot of new things so if you played the game thoroughly theres a good chance you will get bored fairly quickly. if not, than this title will surely amaze you.",60.0

"once i got over the hump of the game not launching it has been running like a dream (outside of a crash bug in one single player mission i fixed quickly). great performance, great visuals. i love how seemlessly you can switch between controller and mouse/kb. i play in first person so i use the mouse and keyboard for on foot then grab my controller for driving. not necessary but i prefer it. i am glad i get the option. i look forward to all the mods that come from this.",43.6

"terrible controls and default keyboard bindings, feels like a console port, recommend using a gamepad especially for shooting while flying a helicopter because the default bindings actually requires three hands. character moves in ways you dont want in 3rd person, like trying to walk backwards makes you walk forward first to start turning, trying to walk up a boat ramp makes you turn around and face the camera instead. poor gameplay qa resulting in infuriating wtf moments, like starting a mission and immediately failing because of something the ai did 2 seconds in. gta online is a joke of endless loading screens. it queues up invites while youre doing other things and doesnt bother to timestamp them or remove invites to sessions that are already closed, so as soon as youre out of that mission you get spammed with a bunch of invites that will fail to join and waste your time. it also disconnects you from your session before checking if the new one is still available or full of players, so even if you cant get in, it has to reconnect you to a new session. i think rockstar just brought in a bunch of interns to take san andreas content and rush out a new product with very little testing and spent all the money on licensing music. the one redeeming quality is that the story is okay so far. id recommend waiting for a 50% sale or higher. they dont deserve $60 for this.",99.9

"take it from someone who has already logged 70 hours in this game that you need to buy it. the attention to detail in the online mode alone is worth the $60. thats not even including the other stuff. while the game does have its fair share of bugs, ive yet to encounter anything game-breaking, all of the glitches and bugs just seem to make the game even more hilarious. pros/cons pros: +an insane amount of content in the story mode, which has nowhere near the amount of content as the online mode. +incredibly beautiful visuals. (even on the lower graphical settings, according to retrax). +funny, interesting, memorable, dynamic characters that make every conversation an enjoyable experience. +awesome music (i like los santos rock radio, and channel x). +great control scheme that is easy to configure. +customizable everything. and i mean everything. +lamar davis +excellent in-game voice chat. +best driving that keyboard + mouse have ever seen. +ing fidlar, ! cons: -piloting helicopters with a keyboard and mouse is incredibly awkward if you have a low flying level. (especially when landing) -no ska station on the radio :,( conclusion: buy this ing game, now. do not buy it for a console; do not buy it for anything other than the pc. play the game it was meant to be played. dont complain about not being able to afford a pc. go build one for $400 and play the game in 1080p, high settings, 60fps. this game is excellent, its everything you could want in a gta game and more. saying that this game is technologically extraordinary would be a severe understatement. gta v: pc is the shadow of the colossus of its generation, and you should be able to experience rockstars magnum opus the way it was meant to be played. my 970 sli, 3.8 ghz processor can run this game in 4k at a smooth 40 fps, so if you have similar or better specs, please do yourself the favor of all favors and pick up a 4k monitor. final rating = 96/100",77.7
"what is not to like about gta? i have played this game on x360 and x1. story mode is fantastic. the elements of playing three different characters was a great idea. seeing the game evolve over the years of releases has been a blast. x1 version looks great but once you can great the game up to max and play it at 60fps it feels like an entirely different game. trying to go back and play it on console just doesnt satisfy anymore. frame rate is king to a degree. driving just feels incredible at 60fps. gta online is a blast to just drive around and mess with people. once you can get ranked up heists are fun but they do leave some things to be desired.",16.3

"the game is astounding in all respects however the online is a mess. there is no division among servers, so someone in america with a ping of 200 may be lagging around your server and that is only if you are successful in getting online. in truth the system being used is so ancient and prehistoric that you will have spent more time loading than playing the game. you want to set up a dedicated server? load single player, then load multiplayer, then load a mission, load the players into your mission, load the mission itself and then when done, load the end of the mission and load the server back up again. usually invited players are kicked back to main menu and have to be invited again to the server. when you play online and dont enter any events or missions, you die by severe lag or get disconnected. worst of all is the  where rockstar service is unavailable and you have no reason at all as to why you cannot connect but your friends might get online even though it says the services are unavailable. its due to terrible online design and no, literally no money spent on buying servers. if you buy this game to get online just be aware you may never actually get online and all the  methods people tell you to do in order to get on will get you no where because this is all based on the terrible service from rockstar. again another example of a game company that milk your money and tell you to go  yourself when their online service breaks down. in truth steam should be removing this off their store as it only tarnishes their good reputation. would love to continue playing the game but have been unable to for 2 days. was playing perfectly fine for 3 days then this . its a disgrace. and a waste of my time and money.",78.2

"the game has a lot of potential, especially the online-mode. however, things wanted by a majority of the gta online community, e.g. more clothing, car customization, more diversity(missions), putting cop cars or any other special vehicles into garages, etc. those simple things could make a lot of people really happy e.g. the roleplay community, but the devs dont seem to care. kinda sad. i cry evry time",53.7
"not reccomended if you have no friends or no friends that buy the game. either wait for it to go on sale, or dont get it at all. the campaign was fun, but id be lying if i said there was more than 40 hours of single player activities. unless you like those busywork, collect-em-all, mindless and oftentimes frustrating tasks they sem to fill games with to get a respectable playtime stat. i honestly prefer watch_dogs, and this game is better in every way. the story was... meh. i didnt care for trevor being such a  for half/most the game, and franklin was the only relatable character (having actual ideals & morals). i hated the helicopter missions, the yoga mission, the mission after the yoga mission, and the insanely sparse checkpoints. you died/one of the other two characters died/you spooked the other racers? have fun starting over, probably from the beginning. easily could have finished this in 25 hours, if i didn;t have to restart every  mission at least twice. then the crashes. first, any menu i went in was choppy as , then the game started crashing constantly for seemingly no reason. this game has crashed on me more times than there are missions in the main story. however, this may not happen to you. plus, rockstars social club seems to make this game incompatible with steam family sharing, which seriously sucks. im just waiting for the rose-tinted glasses to come off of the gaming community and these problems be addressed. the s are overrated too. tl;dr : not worth $60, especially if you are going to play by yourself. prepare for dissapointment.",44.7

"cannot really thumbs this down, but be warned depending on what you run this on, i am not sure if it is for everyone. but be warned this game has its issues, i have gotten in cars, and had it glitch to where i couldnt look any further than a few inches right or left. so far, nothing game breaking, but sometimes you have to restart the game. as i said, unsure if everyone experiences this, but i have had a good few issues with glitches. my major complaint is the online is better than the story mode, but has a good few issues in the pc version. my reviews are not popular because they are unbiased, and i actually tell others what i experience. here goes. there are some graphical issues, at least for me, or at least for people on low settings. youre getting about what the ps3 does. but with greater draw distance. medium would be a ps3, with a slight upscaling, and the rest are getting into ps4, xbox one, and then youre pretty much beating consoles entirely after that. for me on low/medium, jagged edges are the main complaint, now the next part, i am filing under, graphical/glitches as to i do not know if they are just glitches, or maybe glitches due to low quality, i do not know, other players say the game is glitchy, and i do not know their specs.i have shot cops, they glitched out of the drivers seat, then their partner materialized in the drivers seat. so the car was never incapacitated by the drivers death, or at least slowed down. so they just keep pursuing you. sometimes, your view can glitch, at least on my set up, or low settings, i do not know if everyone experiences this, you know fanboys will like it just because it is a pc version, it is good for a port. but it needs some good patchwork. some times your view will  side ways, and mess up your visual orientation. some of these things are simply fixed sometimes, sometimes you have to restart. please give the developers credit, but if anyone else experiences any similar issue, please criticize them for it, so that they may fix this, or people with a similar issue will know their build is to blame. i just got into pc gaming a year ago, and even i can tell you this needs some work, but could be an amazing game with some polishing. next, the online has these similar issues, sometimes the connection seems to have issues as well. i do not know if the connection issues, and being disconnected is something everyone experiences, due to bad programming, and servers. or if my internet is terrible. but the game seems to lag occasionally. this game is great. but these issues, if everyone is experiencing them, and one thing everyone does experience ruins this game. the community. when youre doing missions, or simply just want to get some cash, you can rest assured everyone will shoot and kill you. ignore the, 10/10, would trust the pc community again crap, the community is barely better than console, if at all. you just get shot half of the time, and the other half maybe you enjoy the game. buy with caution, i only bought because of create a character, create a heisting group. stuff like that. i dont really like gta, and thought all of them but vice city stunk. till this one. buy at your own discretion, i would say it is great for shooter lovers, and people who like sandbox games, that are open, with a lot of choice. it is a very lengthy download, expecially depending on your internet. just buy with caution, no games for windows live this time, but there are still issues, unless this is pertaining to my build, but others complained of the same issues.",37.5

"i bought this game originally on its initial launch day, for ps3, at almost exactly the stroke of midnight. i played the crud out of it, beating the single-player without cheats or guides and landing over 80% completion for my troubles (i wouldve gotten to 100%, still without cheats or guides, but gta online cut that venture short). so why would i pony up the $60 to buy it again on pc? simply put, gta v is the best game ever made. and this isnt something i say lightly. the missions are intelligent, well-planned, hilarious, and even sometimes thought-provoking. the gameplay is carefully engineered and entirely meshed out. theres easily a solid 100+ hours of gameplay in single-player alone. and the game world is nothing short of spectacular. if youve seen a more fascinating, finely-detailed, and mind-bogglingly massive game world in another game, id love to hear what it is, because to the best of my own knowledge, it simply doesnt exist. gta online is almost insultingly fun. thats a strange word to use there, i know. but youll be insulted by a number of other game developers who failed to deliver experiences like this in the past. its a proper mmo, built around the famed gta gameplay, and its quite easy to get lost in such an immersive experience. i dare say that of all the mmos, for me anyway, this has been the greatest of the day-slayers. coming into this from playstation 3, and having watched extensive videos online of gameplay from ps4/ xb1, i can confidently say that the pc version blows the others straight out of the water in the graphics and audio department. but thats to be expected from the glorious pc master race, of course. no console can hold a candle to the raw power of the pc. having said that, there are a few hiccups with this version, when compared to the ps3 version. for starters, aircraft controls with keyboard and mouse are simply the very worst of any game, ever. if you have a controller, as i do, thats not a big deal. but flying controls are seriously terrible and rockstar should feel ashamed for how poorly-planned this aspect of gameplay is. worse still, you cant use a joystick, so this game will cost you an additional $3 so you can buy a feather duster, in order to keep your fancy-pants saitek x52 in good standing. why this game doesnt allow for joystick input for flying is well beyond anyone. huge oversight there, rockstar. but the biggest beef i have with the pc version? so far, rockstar havent made any efforts toward helping out the modding community, presumably in an effort to curb cheating in gta online. of course, this would be easily solved if theyd just rent out modded servers to players and create separate characters for those servers -- no cheating, rockstar gets paid, we get mods, everyone wins -- but somehow no one at their studio has come up with this remarkably simple solution yet. all told, despite the few issues the game has, gta v is, in my opinion, the best game ever made. it checks every single box. excellent gameplay, a brilliant story, immersive online play, hundreds of hours worth of gameplay, breathtaking graphics and audio, tons of aesthetic and interactive detail, the freedom to explore and stuff to find when you do... this game offers everything ive ever wanted out of a game, and then some. i just wish i could use my flippin joystick while experiencing it all.",85.9

"this is one amazing game, punching civilians in the face, shooting hookers in the back of head and rightfully taking your money back (because murica) and killing that one guy that threw you out of his car. this is easily one of my favorite games, i got the game on xbox 360, and decided to pre-buy this game (which this is actually my first time!). except there are several things that ruin this game. the bugs and the crashing!!! i could be playing some gta online and having loads of fun! i load into the game and theres a fair chance im going to get stuck on; my characters face; or the loading screen (alt+tab x2 fixes this for me). i have a friend who cant even finish a game on gta online without him crashing (he has a better pc than mine too!), to top that off, the game thinks he hasnt completed the mission, so he gets nothing out of it! after about 1-2 hours of playing this game, it crashes and has to restart. after years of working on the pc version, and 2 delays, i would think this game would be in mint condition and ready to play with little to no bugs, but instead, it has lots of game breaking bugs and crashing here and there. my question is, how did rockstar not see this, i would think they have (and they probably have). now dont get me wrong, even the pc version is lots of fun, but i feel like rockstar half- this. in the end, it would still be a lose, lose for them. if they rushed it (which it seems like they did) people would  and moan that the game was half-, and if they took there time to make this game a real masterpiece for pc. people would still  and moan that rockstar is lazy and takes forever to work on games or hates pc, but in the end, i think you guys should have taken more time. in a nutshell dont buy this game (until more patches) unless you want to deal with bugs here in there (which im okay dealing with, since i got off easy compared to many other people), because in this condition, you will run into bugs. also if you have this game for 8th gen consoles (ps4 and xbone) and you havent bought this yet, wait for the price to go down, theres not much of a difference between the two. pros and cons +graphics +story (which is amazing) +mods (only a few now, but a lot more should come soon) (neutral)o online (still playable a crazy amount of bugs) -bugs -crashes -bugs -bugs -more freaking bugs final score-(score may change overtime) 7/10",48.5

"my first contact with this game i watched a friend beat a mexican luchador in an arm wrestling contest. afterwards he rode in the car with the luchador and waited while the luchador ran into a 7-11 and robbed it. after a short chase from the police the luchador drove the car into the bay. they then swam to shore and upon finding another car the luchador tried to steal it and was beaten to death by a redneck. 100/10 i bought the game no questions asked after seeing this.",44.5

"lets keep it short and simple. singleplayer is great. the story is interesting. there are three different characters with very distinctive personalities that you can control. their have their own missions as well as missions where they work togheter. theres also a lot of things you can do in this game, it feels like its a mix of sim city, payday and need for speed. now, the multiplayer... its great except for the long loading times. you rank up and unlock stuff you can buy, like weapons, attachments, car mods... you can buy your own house, store your cars in the garage. you can play heists with your friends or randoms, you can get killed while you are wandering around los santos. its weird at the beggining, you will feel lost, but once you understand how the multiplayer works, it becomes an addiction. so... the game is totally worth your money. normal price for an aaa title and it gives your hours and hours of fun. not like these ubisoft overpriced and overhyped games that last 20 hours or so.",71.3

"grand theft auto is a video game thats based around its title. its a open world game based on american satire and crime you play as four characters for the sole goal of retriving the american dream. the four characters include you, a online character that takes place before the events of the three other characters. you can get drunk, get high, have sex, crash, die, become a terrorist, take selfies, die, have fun, buy a house, make yourself your american dream. now lets get serious do not play this game unless you have the absolute requirements, minimal isnt enough, even slightly above minimal. this is a next gen title that i expected it would play perfectly fine, but it nearly didnt play at all during my first time playing it. i highly recommend to invest on buying a ton of upgrades, and this game. at the same time. its a fun game i enjoy, and you should take a look at it too.",13.9

"short review ironically limiting for a open world do what you want game. too much emphasis on unstable online leaves you with a single player game that spoon feeds you every step of the way and practically negates any sense of freedom of choice you might think you have. the game practically loses its charm the moment you finish the story mode. you can waste time collecting trinkets, racing and doing what little pastime mini-games there are but they way too few and way too boring. ive made countless attempts to enjoy multiplayer but connection loss is so frequent its more frustrating than fun. gta v is basically a stunningly looking girl without a character. full review: it looks great but beyond that its not. you start short on cash and cant wait to do some heists to fill up your account only to end up having to do missions for a myriad of annoying characters that dont even get you paid. what little missions you do get some cheddar are so heavily scripted the only choice you really have is how to get to them and weather to do them stealthy or full on rambo style. everything else is set in stone. you can hold up stores and jack armored trucks while roaming around but those barely give you any money and dont require any form of planning. you see a truck, you shoot or blow up the doors, you take ridiculous amount of 7k credits and run. stores are even easier, walk in, point a gun at the clerk, wait for him to fill the bag with change and leave. unsatisfying. it becomes painfully obvious that all the attention in terms of extra content went toward the online which is so unstable connection wise you cant play more than five minutes, if that long, before you loose connection. if you find a stable connection for some time, which only happened once for me and lasted ten whole minutes, youll quickly realize you need to play the game with friends for it to shine otherwise youll lose even more nerves. playing with random strangers is like trying to organize a monkey poop fight in the zoo. you can try but youll end up disappointed and probably smell funny. its just frustrating, especially when you remember how gta of old did things. even after youve done the main story you barely scratched the surface of the world. in gta v, the story is all there is, everything else is bland. the world is massive and beautiful and it all feels alive but then the ai comes into play. traffic is borderline , cars turn into you instead of away for you just so they would cause problems while youre getting away from the one time. cars feel different with rear wheel muscle cars throwing their  all over the road while  supplemental cars glide over the road fast but cant turn worth a dam. all of them suffer from the same issue, theyre feather light and will go flying when you go over the smallest of bumps. its meant for kids to pull off stunts and go wow. theyve nailed the choppers though. theyre very sensitive and tricky to fly to a degree you cant help but to think what the game would look like if all the vehicles got the same attention. vehicle diversity is there but youll find only some of them are actually useful for running away from cops with bikes taking the crown just because they make avoiding stupid traffic ai easier. it reached a point i rather used the cab to skip to the mission location than driving how annoying it was avoiding traffic. rockstar nailed driving mechanics in mafia series where you had to watch your speed limit and follow the rules otherwise the cops would pull you over and fine you. it require more caution. in gta v you can literally choose to go between point a and point b (mission trigger location) and deliberately hit every car along the way. some times the mayhem you caused would see the cops go after you but for the most part they dont care. i did donuts around a cop car on the street light and they flew through the red and kept going, not a single  was given. mini-games, pastimes, what ever you want to call them, are so few theyre barely worth the mention. racing, tennis, golf, darts, parachuting, air challenges and thats it. not little but nowhere near the content previous gta games had, and nowhere near fun. from other activities you can steal a cab and do some missions that way or tow vehicles around, but even those mini-missions dont get you paid so much and require you to deal with aforementioned traffic youll just give them up. the main story throws you around between three characters and if it werent for freak missions where you complete tasks for random weirdos it would be half a dozen hours long tops. most of the missions youll do to service the story, youll be bullied by various s to do their bidding or pay them back some owed money that the previous mission forced you to owe. youve got zero control over what you do and how you do it. some have a grain of fun to them but for the most part are so rigidly scripted you lose all sense of accomplishing anything. the game literally tells you go there, do that, now go there and do that. you cant even buy a home of your own choosing and are forced to live where the story places you despite running into countless for sale signs on houses all over the world. you can own garages and later on businesses which youll only be able to afford after the story is done, but even then you cant enter the establishments, save for a strip joint and a golf club. zero freedom. while i was playing all i could think was what a game it would be if you had the option to buy all those houses for sale. live in one, use others as safe houses if jobs go wrong. what would it be like if you had to plan the heist ala rainbow six style. actually invest time doing recon, follow armored trucks, scout their route, security, find a place to hit them, do the same with banks/stores/etc. instead of have the game hold your hand through it. imagine having to figure out what kind of an alarm the store is using then going out and buying equipment to deal with it. if you cant afford it, youll have to find another way or go loud. imagine having to prepare your getaway route and properly ditch the cops instead of have the game script it for you. imagine having side missions where you have to fence the score, lose percentage, etc. the potential is nearly limitless, but no. you get a shiny toy that gets boring very fast. i spent most of my time perving on michaels wife and daughter and religiously avoided doing trevors missions on the count of the character being so ing annoying. dont get me wrong, youll get some fun out of the game, but dont hope itll last after the story. if you have more luck with online than i had, you might squeeze even more. for something else youll have to wait for mods which cant come soon enough. 6/10 -shallow single player experience -lack of freedom of choice -lack of single player content -unstable online (for my part)",106.5

"the pinnacle of the series. gta v is a solid game in every respect. seamlessly ported from console on to pc (1.5 years later) , it provides the player with an extension of the gta franchise unique gameplay. this title in particular is potentially the gta series at its finest. the game has at least 70 hours playability in the single player campaign, not to mention the countless more to be found in its mp mode. one unique feature in gta v is the ability to control 3 main characters (one at a time) and play through an interweaving storyline... this is both unique to the series and i havent seen it in too many other titles. the vehicle mechanics have since improved from the disastrous feel of gta ivs cars. first person driving has since been added. the quality of the dash graphically varies from car to car i have found. no doubt this will be fixed in future patches. flight plays a bigger role in this game , which is also a redeeming feature for those who were fond of its prevalence in san andreas. the game also introduced heists, where players can target particular buildings and choose from a number of options of attack when conducting heists in the main story line. property is of course back and each character is able to purchase properties unique to them. i found great humour in being able to purchase a medicinal marijuana dispensary. also stock trading has made an appearance via the characters mobile phone. the markets change throughout the story dependant on what events have occured. you can also trade within a global network with other gta v players. the engine of gta v is rockstars greatest to date. never before have you been able to interact with the world in such a way as gta v. gta v has more complexities than if you were to merge the last few games in this regard. the architecture and level design is second to none. it is probably the most dynamic engine rockstar have created in terms of character design and acting processes as well. the cutscenes are done beautifully throughout the game, with humour as a constant companion to dialogue. the game is quite deep, and it can at times be slow moving, disengaging the player and making them want to alt-tab, and play something else in between. besides this, it is the greatest gta v to have come yet! i highly recommend a play.",63.5

"about 80-90 hours of game play that includes missions, heists, car jackings, parachuting, driving, flying, bicyling, and of course shooting during all of that. customize your vehicle and personal appearance. this game is longer than fallout 3 and filled with adrenaline pumping missions that will leave you craving for more by the end of the game. even after the story mode ends you can still finish all side-quests and other missions. the story mode does end but the single player campaign will last you for as long as you want after the story mode completes. its not particularly one of the best games ive ever played but it definitely gives you the value of your purchase in hours played from the $60 debut price tag. worth $60? yes. its only 1 of two games that i think have ever actually been worth that price. the other being fallout 3 w/all dlcs.",106.7

"its gta v except on the pc, what do you expect? its the same game as the consoles just better graphics and pc controls. which trust me, thats perfectly good enough of a reason to buy the game. if you were one of the thousands of people who decked out their pc to make sure this game runs smoothly and beautifully, then youll be happy to hear that it wasnt a waste of money. the game looks beautiful as ive said before. los angles, or los santos, is a gorgeous city with plenty of places to rob and people to slaughter. tons of vehicles to steal and upgrade until a little smart car can withstand bullets. plenty of ways to kill yourself or straight up die like head on collisions instant-kill now if youre going really fast and if a car falls upside down theres a 50% chance itll explode. i wont mention much about the main story except that there is three main characters you can play as individually with their own psychotic personality, besides franklin, and they love to steal things and yell at each other a lot. there is obviously a bond of trust and friendship going on between them, so its not just money and rage. however, like said, seen it all before. last thing before i wrap this up. the online is fantastic, if i can find games with people inside, or play mission to earn money or gain ranks. however, being able to have insurance to get back your multi-million dollar car for under $10,000 is something that needed to be in the single player, but never was. i would give this game a 100/100, but literally, in the single player, buy a vehicle and destroy it you never get it back. millions of dollars gone. 90/100 yes im a . anyways, good game, worth every penny. remember, this game is nothing new. if youve played it on the console (i did, 360 and ps4 thoroughly), then youll like it but may get bored very quickly unless you have friends to play it with.",14.9
"i bought this for the online part, and only that. so my review is for the online part of the game, and nothing else. remember back in the day, when we were without ssd disks? yeah, i do, and even then, loading times werent as long as they are in gta online. i mean, there is no difference if you put it on a hdd or an ssd, it loads as sirup anyway. the online part of the game, is made up of different online servers, so when you start the game, you would expect to get a choise in what server you would like to join? maybe you would like to join the server where all of your friends currently are? well, that aint happening. cus what happens when you start gta online, is that you will load directly into a random server. no options served. because of this, you will first have to start up the game once, and wait for the insanely long loading time, then, when you actually are in the game, you can get trought the meny, to enter the same server as your friends. this makes the already 1min+ loading-time to a 2min+ loading-time. when you actually get around to playing, it quite fast becomes repetitive. it feels like one of the cheap korean grindfest mmo. in what ways can you get money? well, lets see... you can steal a car, deliver it to the buyer, wait 5 minutes before you can deliver another car. each car will bring you something between 800-3000 dough. or you could go and kill someone for a bounty? well, good luck in that, cus when someone gets a bounty on their head, every player in a 5km radius comes driving with all their guns ready. also the highets bounty you can get is $9000. another possibility is doing heists. most heists require a four man team, and they are the easiest way to get money. the thing is that it costs a bit to start a heist, and then you have to split the money to all the four guys, and then you gotta pay for all the ammo you used in the heist. when some of the heists then take up till three hours plus, and you earn maybe $250.000, its really not worth it. also to plan the larger heists, you will need an appartment that costs about $200.000 - 500.000+. when you play a game, that goot online in its title, and a big part of the game is doing missions with your friends, you might think that there will be a group or party feature in that game. i mean, even apb got a party feature! well, in gta online, there is no such thing. the people you have in your friendslist, and that are on the same server as you, will have a blue ring around their dot on the map, thats it. thats all the information about friends you will get. lets see, wicht other features are there in this game? well, you got racing. but there really is not a whole lot of maps. and another thing about racing, is that you got to have a host, for the race. and in the host settings he can choose to enable/disable a feature (thats on by default) that makes it so that every car that gets behind in the race, will get a boost to their cars speed... and the guy thats good at driving, and currently got the lead of the race, well he will get a decrease in his cars max speed. what kind of idiot thought that adding a feature like this was a good idea? you also got deathmatch, witch can be played in a few different ways. the old quake way, where you run around in the map, picking up weapons and armor. or the unfair way, where every player has the weapons witch he has bought in the gunstore for himself. meaning that you could get in a deathmatch with a player that got every weapon and nade that gta has to offer, while you might only have a pistol and a rifle. its a really fun mode to play in. after having played the game myself, and having talked with friends about it. im not recomanding anyone to buy gta online. you kinda would expect a game that has gotten so much media covering, to bring something new to the table, right?well it doesnt. you might as well go and play apb (all-points bulletin), since it got mostly all the same features as gta online has. and before you come here and say that apb is a free to play buy to win game, think a bit about the fact that you can buy ingame money through microtransactions in gta as well.",16.1

"like the developers said, gta 5 on pc is basically ultimate edition. -beautiful graphics (if you got the right graphics card) -awesome gameplay, even for returning players -first person -rockstar editor mode which allows you to play as multiple characters that were originaly npcs (non playable characters) and you can use rockstar editor mode to, you guessed it, make videos! -online can have 30 players instead of 16 (i think 16?) -character customization for online is much more unique and fun -you may transfer your characters from online if you had older versions of gta 5 -who doesnt want to play gta 5 on their desktop? biggest dissapointment is that you cannot play offline. if you have horrible internet that shuts off ocasionally, do not buy this game. buy better internet first. trust me though, the game is well worth the money, even if you have to spend more on internet and possibly a better graphics card, its a very very good game. and this is coming from somebody who has already played the game for almost 2 years on console. overall, 8.7/10 sucks that you need a pricey graphics card to run on full graphics, and i wish we could play it offline :(",14.2

"*please note that i have a  laptop, and the review will change as soon as i get a desktop* i have had a great experience playing grand theft auto v for the playstation 3, what i really cant seem to figure out is why rockstar took this long to release a game thats still filled with bugs... to be honest, they should have waited a little while longer, then again thats why you release a bug filled game to the public, and have the public complain about said bugs and the company fixes the bugs.. rockstar is a good company to follow, and this game proves to everyone why theyre still the best.. i loved this game on the playstation 3, continued to love it for the playstation 4, and prowd to have gotten it for pc.. but quite honestly, i dont think it should have been made for pc.. i do recommend this game though, its a great game to have on any sort of device that it was made for, i love playing it, and i enjoy hanging out with my friends in it.. theres no reason to get this game what so ever.. got the game for playstation/xbox?? sell it, get money back, and get this game for steam, cause it will be worth getting at the end of the day..",4.3

"wasup a? sheeeit. edit: 4/23/15: at 47+ hours, 3 days after buying this gme, i must say: buy it now. this is the first aaa title i have paid full price for and didnt feel cheated. the single player campaign is worth the price of admission, alone!!! this game has everyting. it would seem that rockstar actually listens to its community. i understand that some folks have connection issues but, for me, this game runs like a dream!!! zit is so much fun that, if i werent able to play it anymore, id offer up my left nut in exchange. seriously, stop reading reviews and go play at once. it is that good... words cannot describe the beautiful satire that has been honed in this game. there have been many games made before that tried to challenge our predujices as people, but, few, if any, have done so well. from a gamers stand-point, this game excedes the reveiws. it is better than a ten, baybee. with this game you get to dissappear from your normal life, into one of multiple protaganists that you can switch between, depending on the situation at hand, and depending upon whichever one you like or hate the most: your brain-parts come out. that is to say, this game has made allowances for the people who play it, to indulge themselves. now, i dont know about you, but, i am very attracted to that. and, your mother. you tell her who sent you, o.k? you tell her who sent me.... *fires into crowd indescrimantely and then goes home to rethink his life",54.4

"if you are playing for the gun play i can not recommend this game. it takes a step back from gta 4 cover system making cover really only good against an ai. against a person that has played enough if you use the cover system they already know where your head is going to come out of cover if its not out already to kill you. in gta4 you could come out top of cover go left and right and if it was standing cover even crouch and come out left and right. so now in a gun fight you have only one spot he comes out of cover instead of the 3-5 you had to pick from in gra4 to try to get the win in a gun fight. so in my opinion any depth that was in the gun play of gta4 was lost in 5 leaving the story and other thing that were fun. but since we are playing a gun game here with that part of it lacking cant give it a good review.",105.5

"a well over due release date that should have been a pc exclusive, or at the very least never launched on ps3 and 360. atleast it wasnt pushed back again. this is the only way to play gta v. the dev team made sure this title was properly optamized for the pc. this game runs like a dream, it is even playable at a 4k resolution @60 fps if you got the rig for it. the story is well played out between 3 characters and feels like you are watching an action packed movie. the island is massive, highly detailed and breathing with life. from the streets of los santos to the backwoods of blaine county. this game offers a tremendous amount of places to visit and activities to take part in. land isnt the only place to go with scuba gear and submersibles now available you can explore the depths of the ocean, filled with aquatic life. maybe you prefer the skies, with an incredible skybox you can see the entire map from above. bring a parachute its a long way down. you can also join in the fun online with missions, heists, races, deathmatch pvp and even minigames like golf or tennis. rockstar even allows you the ability to create and upload your own game types for you and others to play. exclusive to the pc version you will have the rockstar editor. this is where you can create your own scenarios or even movies and upload your masterpiece directly to youtube. my only complaint about this game is that it doesnt encompasss the entirety of san andreas. this game only includes the 1st island from the ps2 title. (that does not mean this map is small by any means) with hope that future dlc we might see new islands unlocked. though seeing as how long it took to create this one island ill keep my expectations for that possiblity low. how wonderful it would be to get san fierro and las venturas in the hd universe though. we can only hope.",114.0

"if youre interested in gta online, i wouldnt bother. trying to group with other players is the worst mp experience ive ever had in an online game. heres a typical experience for trying to lead a heist. loading the game [2-3 mins with a gtx 760 & i5 4th gen professor, and an ssd, well above requirements]. go to your apartment in-game [2-5 mins, based on where you logged out or spawn in]. set up the heist... you must have the exact # of players required to do any heists (usually 4). the only way to invite players if you dont have friends online, is to invite everyone (about 20 people) on your session. most of these people are doing other things (hunting other players, participating in races/deathmatches, or just wont want to do the job youre on, theyre looking for a diff mission) so trying to get 3 others to join is terrible. you sit in queue for about 10-15 minutes looking to get 3 other people. to make it even better, theres no way to join a session by region, or by language, so youre in a random session with everyone else in the world. about 1/2 the people speak a different language. you, and anyone thats joined, cannot do anything else except sit here looking at the setup screen. you cannot run around in game, you cannot look at your friends list, or change your outfits, you can do nothing except spam press invite all in current session. if you manage to get 3 other people, you hit play. you then have 5 minutes to set up what clothes youre going to wear, and ready up. if someone afkd in the 10-15 mintues it took to find 4 players, you cannot kick them, you cannot manage anything about the group, and must wait the full 5 minutes. if they never ready up, the game kicks everyone in the group back to the world (not back to the set-up screen). so you re-load the game (2-3 mins), and then can try to set up a new heist. if everyone did ready-up, you begin the heist. your group typically has 0 or 1 extra life per mission, so if 1 or 2 pepole die, the entire mission fails. upon failure, everyone votes to try again or quit. if anyone quits, you do not have enough people to do the heist, and the entire group is disbanded, and youre kicked back to the world (2-3 min load time). effectively, if anyone afks, dies, or quits, youre subjected to reload the world (2-3 min load time), and then try to get a completely new group (10-15 mins typically to find 3 other players). so... you get a group, one person is afk, reload everything and re-queue. youve wasted 15 mins looking at a setup screen. you get a group and try, but 1 person dies, then chooses not to retry. kicked to main screen, re-setup trying to find a gorup (40 mins). you find a group, but someone afks. (50 mins). you get a group and actually manage to do the mission with no one dying. youve been playing for 1 hour, and 40-45 mins of that has been spent staring at a setup screen. if youre successful in your heist mission, theres no way to stick with your group and move to the next heist/mission in the sequence. it kicks everyone to the world (2-3 min load), and you have to set up a new heist all over again for the new mission. best of all, this is considered a pretty favorable experience, because you didnt get a troll (some join your heist, then kill you on purpose, or blow up the plane youre supposed to get, then leave: wasted 20-30 mins), and didnt get someone that queues their mic screaming cuss words into it, or yelling in a foreign language. if you get unfavorable conditions, expect to spend about 10 minutes playing the actual game out of every hour. if you dont have an ssd, or have cheap or dated hardware, i cant even imagine what load times are like for you. probably 5 minutes every time it loads the world. this doesn take into account all of the other game crashes, latency problems, bugs (such as not updating your character stats... my driving skill appears to other players as zero, when its actually 90/100), and other server issues they have. the single player portion seems great, but gta online is total garbage at the moment, at least where missions and heists are concerned.",58.7

"a well over due release date that should have been a pc exclusive, or at the very least never launched on ps3 and 360. atleast it wasnt pushed back again. this is the only way to play gta v. the dev team made sure this title was properly optamized for the pc. this game runs like a dream, it is even playable at a 4k resolution @60 fps if you got the rig for it. the story is well played out between 3 characters and feels like you are watching an action packed movie. the island is massive, highly detailed and breathing with life. from the streets of los santos to the backwoods of blaine county. this game offers a tremendous amount of places to visit and activities to take part in. land isnt the only place to go with scuba gear and submersibles now available you can explore the depths of the ocean, filled with aquatic life. maybe you prefer the skies, with an incredible skybox you can see the entire map from above. bring a parachute its a long way down. you can also join in the fun online with missions, heists, races, deathmatch pvp and even minigames like golf or tennis. rockstar even allows you the ability to create and upload your own game types for you and others to play. exclusive to the pc version you will have the rockstar editor. this is where you can create your own scenarios or even movies and upload your masterpiece directly to youtube. my only complaint about this game is that it doesnt encompasss the entirety of san andreas. this game only includes the 1st island from the ps2 title. (that does not mean this map is small by any means) with hope that future dlc we might see new islands unlocked. though seeing as how long it took to create this one island ill keep my expectations for that possiblity low. how wonderful it would be to get san fierro and las venturas in the hd universe though. we can only hope.",114.0
"i love that game!",5.5
"the game is great and lots of fun! however, you all should know that it freezes and crashes in online multiplayer alot. expect to look and feel like a total scrub because you will crash at the worst possible time when doing heists with a group and let everyone down, and then itll rinse and repeat and everyone will hate you and unfriend you because of it. so much fun and so much to do, but eventually youll get enraged because of all the crashes. good luck, have fun ;)",53.8

"it does have the same good features of the console version but youd need a very solid pc to run it efficiently. i particularly had problems with playing gta online. shame really as thats what i was looking forward to. my pc was made with gaming in mind but it struggles with this game. only purchase if you have the hardware to go for it. the recommended specifications are where your pc specs should be minimally. you have been warned!",1.1
"litearally the most un-stable and unrealiable and slowest and buggiest not to mention easy to hack game out there for online, rockstar servers constantly dcing people without reason, getting stuck on getting into every car for 10-30seconds people accessing your vehicles set for no-one to use did i forget to mention the 5min loading screens? if you take all of that out its a good game, but reallyrockstar havent even hinted at fixing any of these issues, ive seen atleast 1 hacker a day for the last 6 days, its  game now but when they fix it i reckon it will be 100% not 40%",94.7

"gta5 is an open world game with a great setting: a living and breathing city, the music, the npcs and behaviour. all that with stunning graphics. crisp and clear at 60 fps lots of gamemodes, from sp story mode, and freemode, and ofcourse online. so much to do, so much to see. you can rob stores, steal cars, race cars, kill people, rob banks, dive and fly, get street hookers in your car, visit nudie bars and look at . what more do you really want? really, after a lousy day at work there is nothing better then beating the  out of some people with a baseball bat in gta5. driving feels great, and for pc gamers the controls are so much better now. 10/10!!",47.2
"the sp is very good. the mp sucks",36.3
"i have never played a more rounded game in my life. pin sharp graphics, cutting humour, brutal violence. shooting, driving, running, cycling, flying, diving, gold, tennis, darts, stocks and shares. its really all here! this is like the definative version of all the gtas to date. absolutely stunning, and im glad i waited for the pc version. keyboard and mouse is the way this game was meant to be played!",3.9

"grand theft auto 5, well.. first of all its a brilliant game even for being two years old on the consoles, its definatley worth the purchase, if you have a couple of friends too, this game becomes too fun! i have spent too many hours laughing really hard that my jaw starts to ache. so yes, i highly recommend this game! so the downsides to gta v on the pc that i have found so far. unexpected game crashes - yes i have the latest drivers. random fps drops.. that could be just me but for some reason my game runs at a nice and steady framerate then all of a sudden drops to 1-3 for like 4 seconds and then straight back to normal. final bad point that i can think of, the servers, even though a couple of my mates and myself have a decent connection, we still find that they are bouncing all over the roads when doing races. the same for ai traffic too! overall, i rate this game a 8/10 and would highly recommend buying this game.",23.2

"rockstar told us the pc-version would be the ultimate version and they were right. i just love this game, the heists, the missions.. everything! 10/10 and its running smooth. :) pros: beautiful graphics and city 3 character switch smooth gameplay hours of fun gta online. cons: rockstar social club integration itself. taking a long time to load sometimes.",34.1

"i bought gta v for my 360 when it first came out and played it often. the disc hardly left the drive as i continued to enjoy the game all the way up to the pc release. i can honestly say its a whole new game on pc. the graphics are stunning! there are lots of new things and im still getting used to the first person view, which im starting to prefer on foot. now mods are starting to come out and im really going to enjoy breaking outside of the barriers imposed of what rockstar intended in this game. my advice for anyone looking at this and thinking i already played it on my console, is to try it on pc. its not what you played before, and you wont look back. sure the story is much the same, but the mechanics and sheer beauty of gta v pc raises the bar to a whole new, very high level for the gaming industry.",24.0
"this games is the greatest game ive played in a long time, and when i mean great i mean, feeling like a kid again great, has so much appeal. one of those games where you dont want to sleep, and you cant wait until you can play it again. the graphics and the preformance make this game an entirely new game up to date for the year, i never touched this game until pc release, now that i have it, it was well worth the wait.",4.9

"this game is mediocre at best. yes with friends it can be fun running around killing other players but overall im already kinda bored. the cars are cool but not very customizable, they are more customizable than previous games but really all you can do is upgrade it and change colors not a whole lot of changing the body, hood, or spoiler.you have stock or one other that isnt stock. the racing is fun but the driving mechanics can really suck at times. the ai are all sharpshooters with pistols... i hold my own against other players but the stupid police snipe me with pistols from so far away. the graphics are beautiful i have everything set to very high and it runs real smooth even after a couple hours of gameplay my computer is still pushing cool air out the top. so that is nice. the bottom line is this is just another grand theft auto game the major difference is the graphics and i guess video editor if your into that sort of thing. honestly i have found all the missions and heists i have done to be horrifically boring and the loading screens between them drive me f****** insane... only get this game if you have never played one of the others til you got bored or if your into video editing. ps i have not had any problems with crashing i just dont think its a very good game",29.0

"joy at last! its finally working, been playing for over an hour and theres been no problems! (touch wood!) before it wouldnt last long enough to finish the first mission. now there seems to be stability. from what i can tell there have been two issue affecting my experience. 1) nvidia experience set all the opimal settings to way over my gfx cards capabilities and instantly put the settings in the red (on the game graphics-in-game-settings had me using over a gig above the spec of my gtx 760 2gb, i7, 16gb while we are at it). 2) downloading the game, i repeatedly found errors in the downloaded file according to steams cache checking utility. even when it was repaired the game would crash. today i finally downloaded it with no errors when checking it prior to installation (this is only time this has happened in over four downloads) and its the first time its run perfectly. after all that trouble i can say that it has been worth the annoyance but i could have done with out it. ok now let the scally waggery commence!",26.7

"i dont need to explain how good the actual game is, everyone knows by now (its been out for 2 years for god sakes, if you dont know how good it is, then get out from your rock)but the pc port is way better than i wouldve expected, because gta iv was just a massacare (windows live? seriously!?)but the gta v pc port was alot less glitchy. though there was a few glitches, theyve been ironed out now, and its a perfect experiance. the controls still act like a damn tank though. pros: +good port +good graphics +customizable radio +being able to type online +so many little details +first person +great ragdoll physics +physics on clothes +more hair colours (gta online) cons: -controls like a tank -mouse controls feel glidey -a few crashes (might just be my pc) -no steam workshop support (yet?)",104.8

"this is a review of the singleplayer portion. i was expecting more from gta v. almost every part of the game is done to the highest quality possible. but the story doesnt measure up. the quality of production is so high it made me expect more from it. but gta v just isnt as charming, funny or crazy as it should be. ive seen many opinions about the writing quality. some saying its incredible, others that its horrible. it isnt either. its pretty good, but pulls too many punches. it points and laughs at everything and everyone in society, but pulls out before it delivers anything of real weight. every joke feels off the cuff, like something they thought up at the spur of the moment. the kind of jokes you dont write down because theyre too lame. its also trying to be a fast & furious style heist story, which makes the game feel like a bit of an unfocused mess. what were rockstar trying to do with this game? its not lighthearted enough to pass as a wacky fun comedy, and it isnt serious enough to pass as a hardboiled crime drama. theres plenty of both in the game, and the end result is that your brain short circuits if you try to think too hard about whats going on. like at one point you do a heist similar to fast five, with everyone acting dead serious, while the company logos just behind them in cutscenes say gruppe sechs. it made something in my head crack. the mix of fun and serious is off. its not cohesive. on a more positive note the quality of animation, more specifically how characters and objects interact with each other is fantastic. unlike other games which can have distinctively different feels for walking, driving and flying, everything in gta v feels like they belong in the same world and act according to the same rules. gta v makes other games feel stiff and artificial. since gta iv rockstar have been using the euphoria animation system, and i looked up why nobody else is using it. its because its incredibly expensive. its not just a middleware system that devs implement themselves, instead its a consulting package where a team of programmers work with the dev team. it seems to be what makes this feel so much better than other games. at no point do characters magically teleport between animation states. instead its all organic and natural. people feel like theyre physical entities part of the world, affected by it and affecting everyone in it. nothing ever takes you out of this sensation. if you havent played red dead redemption, max payne 3 or gta v it might be worth it just to see what the state of the art in games animation is. it also nails other smaller, but also very important parts, like the choice of music. every station is packed with great selections. nothing like watch dogs where the radio was so bad i couldnt stand having it on. having great music becomes one additional thing making sure that every second spent in the world feels worth it. another good thing is that you can use gamepad and keyboard/mouse simultaneously. so you can drive with the controller and reach over to the mouse for precision shooting. or hold down l2 to aim with a sniper rifle and do the aiming and shooting with your right hand on the mouse. or move with the analogue stick while aiming/shooting with mouse. i kept changing between exclusively using gamepad with aim assists or keyboard/mouse, to using both at the same time. button promts change instantly, and there are no issues with playing however you want. the way it should be done. the game is at its best when missions revolve around things that truly matter to the characters. like michaels passion for movies, or his family. or when trevor tries to build up his own smuggling business. thats when the goals of the missions align with their interests, and their enthusiasm rubs off on you. the ultimate payoff for these missions isnt money, its their pride in making something in the world that they care about deeply. like when michael saves a doomed movie production and gets a producer credit. he cant wait to show his name in the credits to his family, and his excitement is infectious. but the game spends maybe 30% of its time on this. the bulk of the story is missions involving the most boring side characters rockstar have ever created. it often doesnt feel like theres a point to them, outside of because the game designers wanted to do a mission here. luckily the game designers did a great job, so it isnt a slog to get through them. but it doesnt feel like its adding anything to the game as a whole, apart from making use of the world theyve made. and when youre making a story driven game like this, having primary missions that dont seem to be connected to the story just undermines the missions entirely. the side missions dont suffer from this, because you know they arent going to be advancing the plot. you go in to them with the correct expectations. having meaningless sideshows in the primary missions though is not ok. the end result is a game where the production quality is amazing, but i went away thinking i guess that was ok. most parts of the story dont get proper closure. a hundred things are set in motion and fizzle out just as theyre about to hit home. this applies not only to the character arcs, but also individual missions and the humor. it all needed just a little bit more, especially in the second half of the game. that said, theres no denying the level of quality they delivered here. it might be worth playing the game just for that. and theres the online mode i havent even tried yet.",43.1

"having played many hundreds of hours on console i was hesitant to purchase gta v on pc. i was convinced that i would be burnt out. oh how i was wrong! going from 30fps to 60fps is a game changer. also with a new platform comes a new community and this community is far more enjoyable and friendly than any of the many people that i have talked to on psn. because of being a high level i have most of the things that i would want unlocked and bought so i have had some of the most fun that i have had playing gta v since the first week that i initially bought it. i have gone in a titan full with 10 people and parachute into the military base to have a competition to see who can get a jet and get out of there before being shot down by the other gta v military jets, and that is just the beginning. there is an unlimited amount of fun to have in this game. from messing around in free roam to doing heist with friends or doing missions with random people that you end up becoming friends with. if youre considering buying this game and you like having fun in both single player and multiplayer no matter who the people you do it with are then this is a game for you! if you are wondering is it another one of thos aaa releases that costs 60 quid and then only lasts about a week then there is no need to worry as youll be absorbed by this game, eaten up and consumed by this fun monster thatr rockstar has developed, and all to be enjoyed at glorious 60 frames per second! 11/10",14.3
