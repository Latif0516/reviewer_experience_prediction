"this is the game the never, ever ends. i picked this game up thinking i wouldnt like it having never played a previous tes game before. sat in my library untouched for about a month or two, and finally took the plunge. i was wrong. i was so very, very wrong. this is probably the best purchase ive ever made on steam. add in the unlimited potential of modding, and its an adventure that continues forever. ive probably restarted over a hundred times by now with a new character, and still only have beaten alduin once. once. theres still so much more do to and explore that im still discovering quests and areas and little hidden things. i still cant believe how much there is to do and im still finding more. at it stands ill probably wake up one day having lost all touch with reality and actually start seeing the world as skyrim with how much ive played. and im totally ok with that.",4652.9

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",1164.7

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",247.4

"i was stacking books on a shelf in my house in whiterun, one of skyrims major cities, when i noticed a weapon rack right beside it. i set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an orcish mace in the other. they were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. the chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the alchemy table for ingredients. id meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because i had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. its even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. part of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy elder scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. in skyrim, theres no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out acrobatics skill. thats gone, so is athletics. the elder scrolls v pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like endurance and intelligence altogether. theres no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. you dont assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. high elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. these abilities are best paired with certain character builds  the high elf regeneration is useful for a magic user  but dont represent a rigid class choice. major decisions dont need to be made until youre already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when youre ready. it contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in skyrim. do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. mined ore and scraps of metal from dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. skyrims land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if its through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. many times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. sometimes theyre purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. in the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. the scale and startling detail built into each creatures appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. in the long run theyre far less irritating than the oblivion gate equivalent from the elder scrolls iv, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. killing a dragon yields a soul, which powers skyrims new shout system. these are magical abilities any character can use, you dont have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, youll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words  each shout has three  hidden on skyrims high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after youve exhausted the main quest story, joined with the thieves guild, fought alongside the dark brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of skyrim. not only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, its also ripped in two by civil war. you can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. lord of the rings this is not, but with the release of every elder scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. skyrims residents are all aware of current events. theyll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. the peasants complain about the jarls who control each settlement, the jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective college librarian complains when i drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. it makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.",92.1

"okay, where do i start? general: this game is able to shock you and make you laugh time and time again, even when playing it for the 3rd time. it takes about 130 - 200 hours of playtime to finish all of the quests, and i guarantee that in the time you will not discover everything there is to discover. if you do not feel like questing, take some time mining, scaring people with magic and shouts, undressing them, stealing, stealthing, killing dragons or giants, throwing cabbages around or simply reading 1 of about 250 integrated ingame books and stories. graphics: this game has pulled off something i have thought to be impossible and pushed the whole gaming industry to the new levels. it has successfully integrated superb graphics into a lot of content. world is beautiful, vast and full of variety and although a bit dark by default this can very easily be changed by just picking one mod from the workshop. workshop: why does this deserve a special tab? because thanks to workshop, earlier mentioned 200 hours of gameplay easily turn into thousands of hours of gameplay. dont like any part of the game? change it! modify it! add to it! a huge amount of mods are being made every day, and whether they spawn an extra cupcake in your house or add new cities with their own storylines they will all change your experience and prolong the fun. name what you want to do, it exists. all of it. cons: - few possible glitches, but all have their fix, just need to be googled out. - a bit too confusing and overwhelming at the start. a lot of unanswered questions may put you off the game. this happened to me on the first two attempts to play the game. i ended up going to the first town, becoming a woodcutter, killing a chicken and getting chased by the guards. but once you push on, you will be nothing but glad you did. who am i even writing this for? is there any poor soul out there who has not yet played this game? buy it. now. please?",116.7

"the province of skyrim might be frigid, but the role-playing game that takes place within it burns with a fire few games possess. yes, skyrim is another enormous fantasy rpg from a developer that specializes in them, and it could suck up hundreds of hours of your time as you inspect each nook and crevasse for the secrets to be found within. the game returns you to the continent of tamriel, where you explore the northern realm called skyrim, home to the nord race. in these northern regions, snow flurries cloud your view, and platforms of ice float on the chilled waters. nighttime often brings tamriels version of the aurora borealis, with its gorgeous blue and green ribbons stretching across the heavens. skyrims predecessor, oblivion, featured prototypical fantasy environments-pretty but not quite evocative of the lores darker undercurrents. skyrim embraces its darker elements. you might feel an eerie chill as you glimpse a half-sunken ship through the mist, or watch as a dragon comes to life before your very eyes under the swirling firmament. closer inspection reveals hard edges, plain painted-on textures, and other visual flaws that are conspicuous should you seek them out. but like many enormous games, skyrim makes a fantastic impression not because its individual elements are sharply honed, but because they contribute to a grander whole. theres so much to do that your quest log becomes an embarrassment of pleasures, offering dozens of choices at any given time, each one as enticing as the next.its impressive enough that theres so much to do; its even more impressive that most of it is wonderful. not every dungeon is a joy to explore. stone-turning puzzles occasionally bring the fun to a halt, and a few repeated cave designs could dampen your spirits. but overall, every task has an excellent sense of context, and surprises lurk around many a turn. skyrim also uses scattered books and references to enthrall you. you may not be a big fan of reading books in role-playing games, but even so, you should make an effort here.the combat in skyrim is the tightest elder scrolls combat yet, the visual and audio cues normally providing proper feedback with your blows and zaps.some death blows result in fallout 3-style slow-motion kills, which retain their power because theyre not overly frequent. movement, too, has seen improvement: you can now play from a third-person view and feel like youre moving across the land instead of floating above it. all in all, skyrim has some minor issues but as a whole is a brilliant rpg.",37.6

house mods adding giant castles, and visual mods. you can spend hours upon hours finding mods that suit your needs in the nordic lands of skyrim. it is worth to note that you should know the game to

"this is a lol you guess it another revamp telling of my review on skyrim. just to get this right off the bat: without mods, this game will feel lifeless granted the game will still be freaking badass the game however as a whole would be a boring rinse and repeat, no matter what race and character build you go with. with mods installed prepare to stay up until 3:00 am in the morning while playing this game oh and i mean from 7:00 am to 3:00 by the way, you will literally lose hours just by having fun with the fantastic and active modding community for this game. now for everything else, the landscape of skyrim is extremely beautiful, you will get lost in hours and hours of content. more so with the vast dungeons dotting the land. while elder scrolls oblivion had this fantasy artistic style going on with the landscape which is breathtaking within its own right. skyrim has this hostile, cold and harsh environment going on. exatcly how it is described. the quests in this game are extremely well done, more so with quests that dont really start right off the bat until you read a book or hear a rumor, which will keep the player more invested within the game. also with the ai system implemented in this game, your actions changes how the world views your character with every good deed you do to every bad deed you do. quest mods also make it more fun and more investing. the skills system arent exactly as perfect as elder scrolls oblivion. within that game, whatever class you pick, it will either make the investment into that class fun or not, but either way you will lose hours just getting your characters skills up as you go along within that game. in skyrim, the skills system are dotted out into three sections, mage, warrior, and rogue, whatever skills you pick it will either help combat scenarios easier or not. even more so if you choose to go with a thief build. the mage system in this game is pretty badass but not as more through like in oblivon. but with mods installed it will make these three aspects much more fun to play and make the skill system much more tedious rather than a clean sweep. the combat system in this game is clunky, its your typical elder scrolls game. if an enemy lungs at you, you block, if you want to gain the advantage against a large stack of bandits or whatever, use a bow. if you want a clean sweep use magic. here is where modding comes into play once again. thanks to these overhaul mods the combat system feels more alive and more challenging, with every minute maybe your last. the npcs in this game while that voice reptition is there, the npcs of this vast world stand out more than the oblivion counterparts, each one has a selective schedule and job they also have their own situation to make these characters either more interesting or more annoying depending upon your point of view. the muscical score makes you want to just to sit back and listen to it. while some people will say its recycled music over and over again there are mods to make the muscial score more diverse and interesting with every combat situation and with every town and city, and dungeon you explore. the dlc are also great in there own right, with dawnguard, its your typical light and darkness story. but here you will not only lose more hours into this game, but you will gain new shouts, equipment and companions, and also player homes. with hearthfire its an add-on, it will just add housecarls and three new houses to the world. if you like that sort of thing. lastly with dragonborn, you will explore a very familiar place with a good storyline, like with dawnguard, new quests, new equipment, and new player homes, and new companions. basically dawnguard and dragonborn you will get new i highly recommend modding this game. in its original state, again it feels lifeless and dull, even if you lose 1000+ hours into skyrim. with mods enabled you will enjoy replaying the game over and over again. i seriously recommend this game.",1480.5

"i love it, it gave me 2 years of fun, i played every playstyle, every race, every way, every dlc. i been from a straight up heavy armor warrior with a huge battleaxe that can turn into a werewolf, and could stand still taking every hit from a dragon without losing almost any health. to a master thief who isnt very strong but can sneak through a entire bandit camp without being seen once.. all the way to guy who never killed a soul, worked hard for his money chopping wood. managing to build his own house and have a family. the main story with all the guilds you can join and areas to explore, you wont be bored for a long time. so dont just rush the main story and assume you seen it all. out of the dlcs, the best would be dragonborn. it offers a large new world, enemies, quests, armors and weapons. while the dawnguard only offers a bit and a vampire lord form, and hearthfire just lets you adopt kids and build homes. the worst thing about it, is there will be bugs, which can easily be fixed by console commands. but only use if needed, like after 5 retrys a quest wont finish or continue. 8/10 only because it can get far too easy, and the bugs. you get stronger than all the enemies too quickly. so i say when you learn the game better, go on master or legendary difficulty for a challenge.",729.1
"skyrim is undoubtedly the best purchase i have made in the past year. its worth every $ that its listed at especially when considering the insane amount of content you are given. i have only spent about 100 hours in the game (this is short in comparison to a lot of people on my friends list) but i can assure you that those hours were all packed with immersive content. here are some key features that hooked me into the game.. 1. dungeon complexity - when i say complexity, i mean that the design for the games dungeons vary greatly from simple to complex. you just have to keep exploring and youll eventually run into the intricately designed areas that get you to pause for a moment and think before being able to progress. at times.. i almost felt as if i were playing the latest tomb raider once again. i also found it quite neat that you could use your shouts to bypass/solve a few of the puzzles. 2. playstyle freedom - im sure tht a lot of people take similar routes but the game does offer a great deal of freedom with its perk system. its definitely a step up compared to games like kingdoms of amalur. do you enjoy melee combat? how about magic? how about a balance of both? theres a lot of possibilities. 3. expansive lore - as ive mentioned, the game has a ton of content. playing through everything (especially if you are aiming for complete achievements), gives you perspective on the whole story and it really is interesting when some quests lore ties into another - maybe even forming a bigger picture. skyrim definitely has a lot more charming qualities but these are the features that i really wanted to highlight. they stood out for me and it was for these reasons that i ended up buying the game last year (only to play it now - 2014) during the summer sale. with that said, i paid $30 for the legendary edition. wouldnt you agree that for all this content, it was pretty much a steal? how many games can you list down that provide hundreds, nearly thousands of hours worth of content (especially if you count the mods) for that kind of price. just remember, multiplayer games dont count! 10/10. buy it when it goes on sale during this upcoming summer sale event.",101.8

"there are many reasons why we play games. some play games to experience a story, some play to compete with others and some play to have experiences they have never had otherwise in real life. alot play games to escape into another world, and live completely different lives, and this is what drives bethesdas elder scrolls series, a series that has excelled in creating complete virtual worlds, inviting the player to live parallel lives. skyrim is the latest world offered by bethesda to live in, and it seems like its bethesdas finest accomplishment yet. similarly to the two elder scrolls games before it, you start off as a prisoner, and this case you are on your way to be executed. just before the axe greets your neck, a dragon appears and the entire army base you were in goes into disarray. you are set free after the incident, and it is up to you to find out why are the dragons appearing, and what is your role in the whole ordeal (hint: it rhymes with shmagonborn). bethesda displays such dedication to concept of open world that makes other open world games pale in comparison. skyrim isnt just a series of buildings, environments and npcs, it is the closest there is to virtual living world in a game. the sense of freedom found in elder scrolls is unparalleled, and skyrim is the best implementation of this yet. the main quest is a minimal part of the game, and most of the fun comes from exploring the world built for you. as you go exploring dungeons, assisting npcs with their problems, joining factions and reading ingame books, you realize what a dense world skyrim is. it is compelling to learn more about skyrim, about its citizens and about its politics, and the more you learn about, the more you are invested in the well being of the world. through all the running around and exploring, you come across a wide range of missions to complete. the main mission is, as usual, the most interesting one, but the rest of the missions can be worthy, and they are necessary to help you know more about the world. you can complete missions for the companions (skyrims equivalent of the fighters guild) to understand how ingrained the warrior culture is in skyrim, or join the mages college and be looked down upon by nords who believe that magic is for sissies. even miscellaneous missions, such as simply standing up for a dark elf against a bunch of racist nords can be satisfying. standard fetch quests are to be found here and there, but there are far from being the norm. the games graphics have been talked about endlessly. now, skyrims graphics are great, with detailed textures and wonderful environments. yet it terms of detail, they dont hold a candle to games like rage and battlefield 3. yet skyrim is nicer to look at than the aforementioned games, and that is because of skyrims aesthetics. bethesda knows that when it comes to graphics, art direction trumps fidelity, and in skryim, the beauty of the world comes from its style. part of the reason morrowind is generally viewed as a much better game than oblivion is because of its fantastical designs; while oblivion came off as a standard european fantasy setting, morrowind was a truly outlandish and exotic location that had its own unique identity. skyrim returns with the art direction that made morrowind so unique. while the location might not be as exotic as morrowind, skyrim it is exactly the blistering norse region that you would think is occupied by burly, war-faring people. the buidlings, the environments, the apparel, the weapons, the creatures, and even the music all give skyrim its unique identity, an identity that is inspired by real-life scandinavia, but is in no way identical to it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ the combat, which is one of the weaker aspects in previous elder scrolls, is drastically improved here. while there is still the feeling that you are hacking away at empty spaces instead of making a real impact on your enemy, but its not as bad as it was in previous games. the biggest addition to the combat system is the double wielding, and it works great. you can go for a sword in each hand, a sword and spell, or two spells, one in each hand. i personally went sword and staff, gandalf style. there is also a favorite menu for items, a feature that pauses makes it easier to equip items in game. this is designed to save you the hassle of going to the main item screen during the game, but it also gives a tactical quality to the combat, since the menu pauses the game and allows for quick equipment changes, which is helpful especially when fighting dragons. dragons appear as random encounters throughout the game, and they are just as imposing as one would imagine dragons to be. you will die alot fighting them, and you would have to rely on myriad of tactics to fight them. a few hacks there, retreat to heal yourself, attack with destruction magic while the dragon is airborne, retreat again, and so on. killing a dragon is immensely satisfying, and through killing dragons do you acquire new shouts. shouts are another new combat feature; they are words in the dragon language which, when you say them, unleashes different attacks on your enemies, or gives you new powers. shouts are a welcome addition to the games combat system, and further adds to the combats tactical quality. now this is a bethesda game, which means that bugs are abound. i have experienced a few unresponsive actions from npcs, same crashes, and an axe suspended in midair. however, this is an area i cant criticize bethesda much about. in a game of this size and scope, it is virtually impossible to spot all the bugs before release. to their credit, bethesda is quick to releases patches that fix whatever issues gamers may have. we can also count on the mod community to tweek all the inconveniences out of the game. bugs are abundant in the game, and players will experience at least one in every playthrough, yet for the most part, these bugs are miniscule and far from game breaking. skyrim is like a music album that has a few tracks that you arent particularly fond of, but rest of the music is pure aural blliss that you cant help but think of the album as close to perfection as possible. i cant point to a single part of the game and say that is the best part; the entire game is an experience. it stays firmly rooted in elder scrolls gameplay, yet with enough improvements and additions (and subtractions) to make skyrim stand on its own. after experiencing the vast, dense and incredibly detailed world of skyrim, you cant help but snicker whenever another game is referred to as open world. good: vast yet incredibly detailed world, incredible depth, interesting story, improved combat system, gorgeous graphics and wonderful style bad: buggy, some standard fetch missions price: aed 9.5/10",2811.4

"skyrim? yeah i played skyrim. picked it up when it launched on the xbox 360 in fact. i mustve put about 30 hours into it before deciding that ive seen it all. let me break it down a bit. when i played skyrim i did the following: i left my house, found a dungeon, grabbed the loot, sold it to the same handful of merchants (including my husband), and...that was it. morrowind was surreal, wonderful, and just obtuse enough to be charming. with skyrim, i felt like some cog in a dwemer machine, trapped in an endless cycle of middling upgrades and a total lack of surprising events. i mean, for crying out loud, more dragons?! these jerks are worse than cliff racers. at the time i figured that i might as well play an mmo, at least then i could get some rare drops. so what happened? whats so different about the pc version that i would put 600+ hours into it? do you really have to ask? modding skyrim is the equivalent of alice in wonderland. you dont get to walk up to the rabbit hole and peer over the edge. you certainly cant climb down, take what catches your interest, and climb out. no, you will fall in that hole. the only light youll be seeing is through the dozens of mods that make up your sunny days in skyrim. in the beginning you might pick through the mods available on the steam workshop. a weapon here, a new set of armor, something that makes cows explode or sends people flying into space, you get the idea. but then you look at what other people are doing with their skyrim. theyve got the 4k textures, the dramatic enbs, the glamour models with their noses just right. now you may be thinking that you dont need all that garbage, and you probably dont. but you do. next thing you know youre on the nexus. its been 10 hours and you havent even started the game yet. stability is the last word id associate with elder scrolls, and thats without piling on the mods. getting your modded game to function is more engrossing than skyrim itself. youve started the game, youre wandering around, and then...crash to desktop. what caused it? how do you fix it? is there a way around it? are you going to lose your saves? after a long enough period of time you eventually stop caring. my skyrim is held together by old tape and chewing gum, and thats fine. eventually you learn to stop caring about those precious game-saves. im going to spoil skyrim: you are the most awesome. everything you do is right and nobody dares to question you. nobody will even do anything unless youre somehow involved. sometimes being the most awesome is fun. its escapism at its purest. a lot of other videogames tend to punish you with death. at worst, skyrim inconveniences you. this game doesnt say you died. or hey poor player! it just assumes you goofed up somewhere and loads your last save. theres something to be said about player-imposed difficulty, but its hard work trying to be the least awesome. theres a phrase i like to throw around when discussing videogames: making the game yours. usually this refers to playing games in a particular way, like a knife-only run in resident evil, or beating megaman without any power-ups. its not always about player-imposed difficulty either, it can be about creating an identity through playing. i remember reading about a morrowind player who spent all of their time in the ashlands. theyd camp out in a chitin hut and hunt whatever beasts they happened to find. they made just enough from selling the carcasses to eke out a miserable existence while dealing with the constant ash storms. this doesnt sound appealing, but i have to respect the hustle. that person totally owns their game of morrowind. when all of the rumors are true, and the player is always the most awesome, theres not a lot one can do to create their identity. this is especially apparent when every single guard you pass mentions something you could be doing (or have already done). your alteration level could be so low that it couldnt levitate an earthworm, but that wont stop you from becoming an archmage not long after stepping foot in the winterhold college. i remember when being an archmage was such hot  in the bards tale, now its just a title any dragonbum can get. when everything in a game takes zero effort and the results are meaningless, why not just make the game in your image through modding? if anything this will lead to new challenges, more possibilities, and *gasp* unpredictability. when i play skyrim, i play with the intent to fill it with as much crap as i can find, see if/when/how it breaks, and attempt to undo the damage with minimal losses. its disturbingly compelling, and thats without discussing the mods themselves. i dont settle for being the most awesome, i want to become omnipotent. only after ive constructed this world, filled it with all of the neatest toys, and prettied it up as much as my mediocre videocard will allow, do i actually play it. at this point im fine with being the most awesome, because i feel like i earned that right. this is the time i put some genesis on, and zone out while exploring, decapitating, and working on that perpetually imperfect nose. perhaps my comparison to alice in wonderland is a bit off. the way i remember it, alice falls in the hole and arrives in wonderland. with modded skyrim; wonderland is a neverending hole. inevitably youll get bored of tearing your game to pieces and putting it back together. you want to see where your curiousity will take you. you might go digging through hundreds of foreign websites to find that anime fighting-style, or ten gigabtyes of hair-styles. you could even find yourself in a lab. what it all comes down to is that skyrim is what you make of it. the game is fine on its own. its certainly not lacking for content, and even without thousands of visual-enhancing mods it looks decent. however, skyrim becomes so much more simply through the act of modding. to me, this is the ultimate sandbox game, and will likely only be bested by bethesdas next single-player rpg.",657.8

"skyrim is not the game people revere it to be. in order to review it, youd need to point out several factors that weigh in skyrims favour. first factor being that you can mod it... very important factor! without mods skyrim is a buggy mess with no depth to the combat nor much depth with the main story and characters. if youre not going to be modding the game, just playing it vanilla, then i recommend just playing through the different side quests and guilds/groups the game offers. they are much more fun than the main questline and have some nice rewards. another factor in skyrims favour is that its the only one of its kind. (discounting the previous tes games, which are outdated. im talking strictly games that are popular today.) there is no other open world rpg game that offers as much as skyrim with as good visuals, voice acting and functionality. (although skyrim is insanely buggy without mods.) you might be asking yourself why i recommend this game if im not stroking its ego telling it that its a big boy, and instead bad mouthing it. well, it has a great modding community (bar the big floppy private parts mods) and an ever growing modding community too. its a few years old now, yet still manages to pump out awesome mods at skyrim mod nexus and on the workshop. i love modding and playing this game, and personally think youd be crazy to experience skyrim without mods. tldr: skyrim isnt that great without mods, i like this game with mods. you might think differently, just my humble opinion.",247.0

"(this review is a very long one. it actually is kind of an article between, a gameplay review, a role-playing guide, a mods compilation, and story of a character. if you are not intrested, i suggest you to pass it right away.) (content is written all by me. please do not distribute without permission.) the elder scrolls v: skyrim, is undoubtedly one of the greatest pc games ever made, personally the single best rpg and open-world game ive seen. it is an unlimited digital source of pleasure for a lifetime frp lover like myself. there really arent many words to describe such perfection. first of all, best thing about skyrim is the fact that, things you can do is literally endless. content is literally endless. i am at around +2.000 hours of skyrim gameplay (also played it a lot before my steam copy.), and everyday, i still keep discovering some totally new things. vanillia game with dlcs, has at least over 2.000-2.500 hours of gameplay (around 1.500 hours without any dlcs, maybe?), if you do nothing but quests. endless number of mods you can apply, will make gameplay way, way longer. and again, this is only possible if you do nothing but quests; no sightseeing, fast traveling all the way, skipping lore, and forgetting about the identity of your character. still, its your choice to play skyrim in the way you want. i have 3 characters, and ill talk about one of them, whom i mainly play. (vanillia content is more than enough to play 3 unique paths (except main storyline) for 3 seperate characters. you also can alter main storyline to a degree.). but first, id like to talk about mods which i actively use in all my characters (plus, there are some particular ones for each character.)(no visual mods included.) - first of all, most indispensable mod for me, is probably the disable fast travel. i think that fast traveling absolutely ruins the game. i never fast traveled before (neither in skyrim, nor oblivion. morrowind didnt had it anyways. damn, i love morrowind.), never will, and i hate people who fast travels. fast travel system is necessary as a result of overall demand to skyrim, but when its being used, thats half of the games beauty gone. some people play it just for the other half anyways. - i very much like the ineed mod, which adds a streamlined approach to needs. you need to eat, drink, and sleep once in a while, for full effectiveness of your character. it has some nice details, like for example, you can carry a flask, drink your water from it when you are thirsty, and fill it from any water source when depleted (even from rain!). - static mesh improvement, an amazing mod which replaces some plain textures with idea of adding a feel of third dimension, with actual 3d meshes. it adds a whole new level to details all around tamriel. - skyui, a must-have interface overhaul - cloaks of skyrim - skyrimspeeds, speed adjustments - improved dragon shouts - command dragon, for manual control - alternative crafting system, helps role-playing without abandoning your gear potential - immersivefp, for first-person dragon & horse riding - a quality world map with all roads - touring carriages - fnis, custom animations engine - and, falskaar! its an amazing mod, which adds a new quest line, a huge new map, and a very solid lore. very professionally done, almost like an official dlc. the character i want to talk about, is my female dragonborn assassin, last member of the dark brotherhood, and guildmaster of thieves guild. shes the character that i played the most, although shes not the character i first created, or beat the main storyline. i beat the main storyline with my mage for the first time, and i wanted continue as an assassin, created her. after completing the unbound quest (which is the very first quest.), i literally quit the main storyline, and completed the dark brotherhood and thieves guild storylines (yea, you can do that. you literally can complete almost every side quest in tamriel without touching the main story.). by the time i return to the main storyline, i already was a master assassin, (skyrim has an npc progress system; it doesnt let you level up more than usual before story, and one-shot every npc. youll still have an adventage tho.), so i progressed through it at ease (except the dragon parts, where i needed to go head-on.), and i completed it, as she completed her personality. shes not a type of assassin without honour, shes not like killing random people just for money/fun, or shes not using her dragonborn powers for personal gain (spidey-philosophy), instead, she actually delivers justice, and avenges the downtrodden. shes more like batman, the dark knight, except the killing part. and all that thieves guild, stealing part, is also like the phiolosophy of robin hood, or at least the cat woman. in the end, shes a very righteous character, in her own way. i completed a billion small quests, and some big ones like civil war and the companions storyline (actually, all the big ones as far as i know.), and married with aela (yep, aela is a female. yep, im a female. yep.) before heading to dawnguard dlc. ive completed dawnguard as a vampire. i got cured afterwards, but im still not sure about being a vampire, since it actually fits the concept of her being a master assassin hiding in shadows, but there are too many downsides; i wont ever be using the vampire lord form, since its totally irellevant with my character, and i dont like its benefits/aesthetics anyways. after that, dragonborn came out, and i also finished it, which actually fits perfectly to her personality, since the purpose is (kind of) assassinating a corrupt leader as the only assassin (because of being a dragonborn) who can do it, and became a complete dragonborn. since then, im traveling short distances with shadowmere, and long distances on a dragon (not dragon fast-travelling, im navigating manually.). i do some unusual things in my spare time in skyrim, which many can find weird, but i enjoy a lot. for example, i have some favorite places (which i wont be sharing. be assured, finding your own places would be much more satisfying.), i sometimes toggle off the running mode, and randomly walk at these places again and again, for hours, never getting bored. i also find books in skyrim very exciting (there are countless in-game books which you can read. each one of them are written exclusively, with its unique content.), i have a great intrest in collecting and reading them, and i actually find some of them way more intriguing than many popular real books. some of which i can recommend: rising threat (4 volumes), the wolf queen (8 volumes), kolb and the dragon (thats probably my favorite book in the game. not in terms of its story, but it is actually a choose-your-own-adventure type of book.), the black arrow (2 volumes), a dance in fire (7 volumes). as a side note, in my honest opinion, books in oblivion were better... before finishing, here are some mods that i use especially for my assassin: - the dance of death, a kill-move mod - higher jump - martial arts - realistic crime radius - throwing weapons redux - faction crossbows - stealth immersion and, i suppose, thats all. in terms of characters, as you can see, making a character totally unique is pretty simple, its just a matter of will. skyrim, or any game for that matter, can only provide you the visualization and tools of role-playing; you have to use your imagination for an advanced frp experience. and in terms of gaming perspective, you now should have an idea about how i feel about skyrim, and you probably figured out how different you can approach to the game. in the end, conclusion is actually pretty short, and simple: skyrim is a must, must, must, must have game, and a masterpiece to experience, just like a mozart concerto, a shakespeare play, or a trip to one of 7 great wonders of the world.",1612.8

"skyrim is the best elder scrolls game so far, with the expansions it has gotten even better. i felt that esiii: morrowind brought more to the table for its time than esiv: oblivion but believe this game has done even more. i have enjoyed it on console, on pc and gone through the dlc which is worth the extra cash. the only thing missing is co-op/multi player but elder scrolls online is running now, although i wish they would have done things a little differently on that game.. even if your not an elder scrolls fan or follower the game is a nice play as it allows you to customize yourself and play in many styles to allow a change up. i did have a few technical issues following the main quest line but just shifted to side quests and other things until i found out how to fix my save. they could have done a litle better on updating to debug some of the common issues or allowed a form of abandoning quests to reset them. overall id say 9.5/10 for what it is as i cant complain about missing features that just werent supposed to be in the game although i think they coulda just put out a co-op patch/expansion to allow us to play with 1 friend or something which would have enhanced the gameplay alot and expanded the games popularity.",19.3

"skyrim (base game) - review what is there to say about this game? where do i even begin to tackle this monstrosity that has taken me on my 1st playthrough 141 hours just to finish the skyrim base-game? were not enough counting the dlcs here...yet! the elder scrolls (tes) is 1 of those series that are loaded w/ tons + tons of content, offering up an insane amount of value + bang for your buck. to experience all of it at once - imho, at least for me, thats probably not the wisest ideas. this game has so many different storylines, quests, areas to explore, factions, things to do (i.e. get married) - its a game you play for numerous hours until youve hit that wall (i.e. i need a break for a while); just go away from for a bit; & then it calls you back for more. very few games do this to me - test drive unlimited 2; far cry 3; + skyrim all come to my mind here. class systems are gone here in skyrim. just practice the attributes you want to want to improve (i.e. sneak around, improve that skilll; swing a 1-handed sworded and hit someone, that improves; cast a spell from a certain school, that improves, etc); + select new abilities from those attributes to learn at level-up time. since youre constantly improving your attributes + leveling-up like theres no tomorrow, this can be addictive - think like that diablo-like kind of addictive. skyrim has improved in numerous ways over its predecessor. graphically, on the technical side, the game is much better than oblivion. girls actually do look more so like girls (in the face, namely), this time around - thanks for finally getting this right, bethesda; it took you long enough! while many of the game areas are nowhere as crazy + interesting as oblivions shivering isles expansion (my favorite area in any tes game since starting in the series w/ morrowind). these lands have a nordic influence on them + most of them truly do look fantastic. likely, if you see an area way out in the distance, theres a great chance - you can go there + explore it completely, which is fantastic. combat here has improved & is a bit more visceral than oblivion - but, when compared to others, it certainly is still a little bit clunky (like most tes games) + does not rival the combat of other games like kingdom of amalur: reckoning + dark souls (those games certainly do specialize in combat) - its still pretty good here in skyrim. one thing thats new - you can now dual-wield weapons; can even wield magic in one hand, a weapon in another; dual-wield different magic spells in each hands; and/or even dual-wield the same magic spell (for double the power). simply put - these are great additions to this games combat system. npcs in the game-world actually have taken a page right out of the gothic play-book, as you will see npcs doing things to immerse you into the world - i.e. blacksmith sharpening blades with equipment; npcs acting on schedules + doing things together on their own; + things of that natures. as usual, theres even more books added to read, for those who want to dwelve into the ever-expanded + ridiculously-sized lore of the series. the main story here is this - dragons have returned to skyrim, youre to meet a certain group of people to fulfill your destiny as the dragonborn (a human that can learn dragon skills), learn dragon-style shouts, & take the dragons out once + for all - which is typical fantasy stuff. while the main quest is decent enough + is solid, it really feels like its just another quest in the game - like many of the main quests in elder scrolls base-games since morrowind. while bethesda is no bioware + no obsidian when it comes to generating fantastic narrative, prose + dialogue - where bethesda succeeds over just about every other of the game companies is creating insanely huge playgrounds that have a good deal normally going on w/ tons to accomplish, if you like what youre doing. trust me - this is another addictive sandbox from bethesda, in which you wont know how to let go of for a while or after being away for a while, it will eventually get you coming back for more. while not everything here is a home-run, there are also many good-to-great plots + storyline strings here - such as the thieves guilds quest-line + especially dark brotherhood quest-lines, that i dont even know where to begin. skyrim will generate some random quests on its own, which often do wind-up in the misc section - which could keep you going for a long time. as if the base-game couldnt do that enough already, making this game such a time-sink - throw in also that the game ships w/ the toolkit these days & the ridiculous amount of mods out there b/c this series has an extremely heavy modding community + fanbase - you could live for 100s of hours in skyrim, even long well after it takes finishing the insane amount of content that bethesda has already provided. if theres something about skyrim you dont like - i.e. the ui isnt that great, again; even though its improved immensely over oblivion - trust me, theres a mod out there to fix your issue w/ the game. for example - skyui mod vastly improves + fixes bethesdas ui-system immesely. by offering up a huge sandbox & an insane amount of things to do (from questing to exploring) here, skyrim succeeds in proving again why bethesda + their elder scrolls is 1 of the best - if not, the best - at providing addictive time-sink rpgs. bethesda yet again offers up the kitchen sink here; ill certainly drink to that + from that. rpg fans looking to get lost for 100s of hours, its almost impossible to rival what bethesda does in their games - & thats especially true here in skyrim. simply put - another rpg masterpiece from bethesda. final grade = a+",180.5

"this game is honestly the best game ive played. ive sat down and played countless hours on the elder scrolls games but this tops it off. a great follow up and so much better than elder scrolls online that was recently released as the next in the series. if you are skeptical of this game still im not done yet. there are thousands of hours of modding put in by a dedicated modding community that adds around 1000+ hours of new content just by using the mods from the workshop, if youve looked at the workshop and it doesnt look big with only 10,000 mods, you have the nexus with over 30,000 that adds so much to your game and if you have complaints there is a mod for it that changes it and makes your experience amazing and fully immersive. the game challenges you to patience and choosing the right moment to do things and it really adds in an immersive way of living in the elder scrolls with full ability to extend your abilites in the largest scale open world map ever made. you can slaughter a city of the rebels - the stormcloaks, or delve deep into dungeons recovering powerful artifacts that can help you on your way to the top of the chain. as your progress your story the way the people of skyrim treat you differentiates, you can slay a dragon and they start to say youve slain a few dragons in your time or when you become the whisperer of the dark brotherhood you find npcs every so often that use the dark brotherhood greeting hail sithis. there is a whole new experience to everything you have ever experienced in a game. buy the game.",263.7

"i dont care what anyone says, skyrim is one of the greatest games i have ever played, i have dedicated sooo much time into it, (yes i know on my profile it says i havent played it for all that long but i never really played it while connected to the internet so yeah) there was a time when i would play skyrim for close to 12 hours a day (yep sure did take my life away from me) it was actually my very first steam game. after dedicating even more time in tes iv oblivion, i eventually got skyrim in 2012 and i will admit that after creating all kinds of characters i did eventually get tired of it, that was until i discovered mmoxreview on youtube (great guy, check him out :)) i then started modding my skyrim game, and a once great game turned into something legendary... now to be honest i wasnt all that fond of the main quest, but the thieves guild and dark brotherhood in these games has always really inspired me, i just wish they could have made them both longer :( unfortuantly i have never played the expansions for skyrim seeing as though i cant afford it :( yeah i know, sad isnt it, but that hasnt stopped me from playing skyrim over and over again... tes online... lets just say i probs will never play it because i just dont really like the looks of it. and i am very keen for tes vi (i think it is going to be set in hammerfell) please tell me if you would like me to write a guide for this game, i am quite happy to and i promise i wont use any of that noob language if i do. i highly recommend this game, i give it a score of 9.5/10 have a nice day ;)",179.8
"the anticipations were very high for this game months before its release, maybe even months before this game even had its first piece of gameplay shown. reason being its successful predecessor the elder scrolls iv: oblivion. a game that soley revolutionized the western rpg scene completely, with true next generation graphics and depths. going even further back we have yet another giant and just an astonishly beautiful and incredible game - the elder scrolls iii: morrowind. i can not begin to explain the elder scrolls to someone who never heard about it. the last 3 games have all recieved game of the years and been just hands-down, non-negotiable, best selling and mind-blowing epic games. it is hard to talk about any individual elder scrolls game without mentioning any of the other games and the bigger picture. all the latest elder scrolls games are in the top 5 of my favorite games of all time, all three of them. hell, the elder scrolls series is better than the half-life series... have you any idea what that means? how much confusion this causes to my beloved half-life? no you dont. these games are better than the best. one more paragraph of how awesome elder scrolls are before getting to skyrim. these games keep my up at night, i dream of them by day, they make me smie, they make me cry, i love them, i hate them, they change me, they leave me, i conquer them, i resign to them, they are my soul, they are my heart, we are one. oh tamriel, why are you a fictional world? why are you not real, i long for you, i live inside of you, from vvardenfell to summerset isle, from the great glaciers of skyrim to the cursed realm of oblivion, from fargoth the bosmer to the adoring fan. if i ever truly worship something, it got to be the elder scrolls. you are my drug. skyrim is the weakest of them. its morrowinds and oblivions little sister. yet it is the most popular one, how is that possible? well theres just something about dragons, isnt there? an rpg with dragons is always an rpg with dragons! flying immortal beasts that breathe fire and are legends with the gods themselves. skyrim got very successful thanks to that console generations drought and the lack of good games to play, also because all elder scrolls games are being successful surprises. with at least 5 years in between each game the fan base have had a good long while to linger in their despair and demands, giving growth to something called hype (good example: half-life 3). i will never get to the actual game itself, will i? its a western rpg! what else is there to say, expect role-playing with normal sized swords and not some japanese bananza. you are set in the province of skyrim, which is not the most northern one, but it sure as hell feels like it. skyrim is like the opposite of a really good book, instead of giving you a story and the rest is up to your imagination - like books do. skyrim gives you the imagination and you are the story, you play the dragonborn, a son of dragons, of septim. the rest is up to you. skyrim does not feel like home, oh no, you are in a hostile world where you constantly feel threatened. the key thing in skyrim is the atmosphere, there is nothing quite like it. same goes for all elder scrolls - again. so much visually appealing flora and architecture, a living world with animals and creatures roaming about. then there is the extremely in depth story that only the true fans will explore. who were the akaviri? what lies beyond tamriel? what happened to the dwemers? nerevarine? is kvatch rebuilt? is the adoring fan finally dead? is azura the best godess ever? etc. questions that will live on through all games to come, questions that never can be truly answered because that would break the rules. you, whomever you choose to be, will slowly get used to this hostile world as you expore the story and build your own. kill stuff, get loot and level up. focus on health, stamina or mana - depending on your class build; brute force, striking speed or cunning magic. as you choose your path, you will encounter people to lead you and people to stop you, join the appropriate guild and do side quests. take sides, fight battles, even fall in love and get married, buy or build (hearthfire) a house, adopt a child. encounter the most mythical of creatures - spriggans, werewolves, giants, vampires (dawnguard). use shouts to cause only the havok dragons can, or spend your time stealing from the rich and give to... yourself? in the end, you will stand all mighty and look upon yourself, like an author looks upon his work. you will look back on the days of struggle, on the days of joy - and you will realize that its far from over. you will spend hundreds of hours in skyrim, because thats what you are meant to do. hopefully you will have more questions than ever when you leave the game aside. you will use this hunger to explore other worlds and look upon your real life and use the fictional beauty to define... what the  am i talking about?",184.3

"before skyrim, there was oblivion. it was flawed, unbalanced, dated and had dlc for horse-armour, and yet it was still loved because despite these things, it was still one of the best games of this genre. skyrim is oblivion but without the bad bits. i still dont understand why there arent more games like this. you are let loose in a massive open world and are allowed to do what ever you want. the closest games to it would be mmos or grand theft auto, but skyrim is a single-player experience. youd think that this would make it lifeless and unrewarding, but you couldnt be more wrong. the entire world is lovingly hand-crafted. every character you see had to be placed there. they had their face, personality and clothing picked by a developer of this game... and then youre free to come along and end their life with one slash of a blade. or not. the choice is yours. i didnt expect much from this game. i had kind of seen through oblivion and it became lifeless for me, and i thought that since this was constrained by the same hardware that it wouldnt be a large leap, but i was so wrong. i couldnt wait to explore every crag and valley simply for the sake of it, accompanied by the amazing lotr-style soundtrack. i happily gobbled up the quests and have had countless exciting memories of this game where ive accidentally picked a fight with some one bigger than me, or where the game glitches out spectacularly. what ever happens, its a joy to behold. even if youre not a fan of this sort of genre (come on, who isnt? the elder scrolls games are a genre in their own right!) you need to play this game. get it when its cheap and youll more than get your moneys worth, even if you only play a fraction of what there is to see and do. you can live a virtual life as a fisherman, merchant or fighter and unlike the older games which required a bit of imagination to pull off, this one has the depth and complexity required to make it enjoyable. the down-sides? the dragons are too easy to defeat, though this game has since been patched to include harder ones. youll hate it when somebody dies through no fault of your own (damn you, radiant ai!) and youre left with an empty shop where you once purchased your stuff. youll end up with far too much in your inventory as you plunder tombs and your companions become more of a burden than a help as you level up, transforming into mules to carry your rubbish as you battle against the undead. but really, who is going to be reading this review without an idea of what this game is like? who hasnt seen the thousands of mods available for free for this game? they make the vanilla 100s of hours of gameplay turn into 1000s. youll have no life for weeks after picking this game up! in short: buy this game.",171.1

"good open world rpg... has the feeling like u really are in skyrim. this makes it wonderfull. later in the game. it will get a bit borring.. but who cares!",30.8
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of those games that ultimately grants you the freedom to do the things that you can only do in your imaginative mind. for example, you can kill people in bars, villages, castles, stands, anytime you want, however you want. killing by doing a finishing touch is my favorite part of the game. you can have a pet, wife, build a house and do a lot of varied things. though what makes this game better is the mods, you can do tons of things with it and do a lot of hilarious crap, stunts, sex, movie scenes and other crazy stuff. this game just never ends and theres always things to do even if you dont want to do quests. dragons, monsters, spirits, horses, women, potatoes, and stealing things craftily are all huge features in the game. now, finally, dont be like me who waited to buy this game on sale and not pay the full price of it. because it is definitely worth your money!",67.0

"ive been a fan of the elder scrolls series for a while, and i think skyrim is definitely a worthy addition to that line of games. skyrim is a huge, immersive, lore-filled, immense world full of character. you can explore, fight, collect, or just wander around like a tourist taking screenshots. even after playing for a couple of years, i still constantly find new places to explore and new experiences to be had. everything about this game is extremely detailed and well thought-out, from the crafting system to the player homes, from dungeon layouts, to the races of the different npcs you encounter and the way they use their culture to express themselves in their clothing, armor, weapons, homes, and towns. if the hundreds of hours offered by the game itself isnt enough, there are literally thousands of mods for skyrim, offering everything from texture enhancements to full cinematic lighting effects. there are hours and hours of additional fan-made quests and storylines, in addition to the three official dlc expansions offered by bethesda. new npcs, pets, followers, houses, towns, armor, weapons, food, ingredients -- you can probably find a mod to change or add to almost any aspect of skyrim. in this way, you can keep the game fresh and new, even after hundreds of hours of play. if you break it down to dollars spent per hour played its probably one of the best deals in gaming.",418.6

"skyrim is amazing, defiantly recommend for medieval lovers. here is a poem i wrote about skyrim! skyrim the sky was blue, it was true snowy mountains, huge lands the one who seeks adventure didnt know what he had inside what he could do, with the power could he fly, could he reach the sky no, but he was the dragonborn the one and only who could defeat the ancient ones the ones who could fly, glide and attack track their foes, eat their toes the dragonborn can intake their soul he can kill any sort of troll sword slashing, kicking and bashing loot the things you have killed sell the items, receive money and then buy a bunny burn a chicken, raid a house be stealthy like a tiny mouse get married or become a wizard like harry potter level up by doing quests to become the best but now youre crying because the villager was lying then you come back into reality and realise it`s only a game!",39.5

"this game is not a love it or hate it, its a love it and hate it. sometimes while playing i think to myself: this is the game, its just a dream come true, is it real?, but the next moment it might change to: this is the most stupid waste of time ive ever paid for. first of all, it is huge. it is enormous. ive done 300 hours into it and im still in the middle of the main quest. its got everything: fights, spells, potions, horses, dogs, children, marriages, dragons, clothes, bookcases, treasure maps, grocery stores, pagan worshipping, war, armageddon, waterbreething, dead naked sorceresses in bikinis, mysterious ancient civilisations, glowing mushrooms, mammoths, zombies and lots, lots, lots of bugs. it is very beautiful, especially at night, when you see the northern lights shining, but also very ugly when the low and high resolution textures are messing up in front of you. its got so many quests, tasks, characters and places, i think even developers dont know them all. it is a gem for those who like to explore and discover the territory for themselves. each cave has something in it, each ruin might conceal a secret, each village might have a mystery to uncover. the freedom of choice given to the player is unnatural. you can be a werewolf, a vampire, a mage, a warrior, an archer, a thief, an assassin, a blacksmith, a miner, an alchemist, on top of the dragonslayer and the chosen one, and most of that you can be at the same time. this schizophrenic development of the character results in a no less chaotic gameplay. you have swords, bows, daggers, maces, spells, magic staffs, magic scrolls, and dragon shouts, all of which you can use as weapons. you meet all sorts of enemies and youre free to deal with them by any means you prefer. there is no special weapon for a giant. you dont really have to use spells against a mage. moral choices are also a blur. there is no proper or right way, really, you just do stuff and get stuff happen as a result. its not a bad thing to use conjuration spells, necromancy is not punishable, poisons are as legal as healing potions, there is no white or black magic. sometimes its impossible to understand if youre doing good or bad. i think the only thing that stops freedom from being absolute is the quests. if developers would remove the quest lines as such, turning them into a mass of random tasks you can perform in any sequence, at any time (and preferably at any place with any character), it would make the game a triumph of freedom (and a complete mess). so, skyrim is a beautiful, ugly, strict, messy, very stupid and very clever game, which everyone should play at least once. on the easy level it is almost casual, no effort is required to deal with the fights. it can be played on a mac through crossover, but it is sluggish no matter how low the graphics settings are.",305.1

"how could anyone not love skyrim? with mods abound to customize your game, its a game that keeps on giving long after you get into it. i absolutely love this game, and if i wasnt running on a very weak computer id probably never stop playing it and modding it. i suggest skyrim to anyone who has never played it, or even playing it on pc vs console (the modding capabilities to change the way your game looks and plays are so much better than console -- take it from someone who first played skyrim on her xbox.) absolutely well worth the money and an excellent game that you cannot put down.",459.2
"step 1 - buy the game step 2 - mod the game until someone comes to your room and asks you what movie is this? the campaign is short but a great one. you have to save the world from the dragons who are led by alduin, the most evil dragon....basically that is all there is when it comes to the campaign. but apart from that there is a story you create on your own with a rich and detailed open world to explore and million other cool side missions to do. this game doesnt hold your hand at all, you can approach the game in anyway you want by becoming a thief, a vampire, a werewolf etc etc you can also join different groups like the dark brotherhood for example, you can join the empire and become an imperial or join the stormcloak rebels to free skyrim from the empire influence. crafting, smithing, enchanting, marriage, adoption, purchase a house, learning spells, cooking etc, this game has so much to offer it will literally consume you. astonishing graphics (especially with mods), amazing soundtracks and endless quests. this game is a masterpiece! worth every penny! personal rating: 10/10 greatest open world rpg of all times",70.7

"it may seem odd to review a game i have not finished, so take that into account as you read this. i first played the elder scrolls series with morrowind. back then i thought it was the coolest thing ever. huge world, tons of monsters and weapons. at the time though i was big into mmos so i felt very disconnected from the game. alone. so my time with the game was short, and i never finished the main campaign. when oblivion came out, i gave it a try, and instantly was reminded of morrowind and why i lost interest in the game. so i probably played it for only a few hours my first time in. elder scrolls games are a fickle thing though... you see screenshots, hear about other people having fun, see mod updates, and before you know it. boom. right back in you go and you forget why you ever left. my right back in was skyrim. so much hype, so much graphical goodness. i resisted for a long time, then came a steam sale and i was in. the game... wow, so much better. is it the dragons? hell yes it is the dragons! i have about 50+ hours on record as i type this, and i go off and on playing the game so as not to get burned out on it. i modded it up as best i could and i think it makes it that much better. graphics - just amazing! even unmodded this game looks stunning. character models less so than the world itself, but still a great show for the eyes. sound - im no audiophile, but i tend to get drawn in more if the sound is good. this game does not disappoint. music, voice acting, sound effects, all perfect. the first time i fought a dragon, and it came swooping in and bathed the ground around me in fire, i was amazed at how awesome it sounded (surround sound headset of course!). do yourself a favor and really crank the volume. again, i am not finished the game. will i ever? who knows, and who cares. i am having fun so that is all that matters. if you are holding off for similar reasons that i was, wait for a sale like i did. but dont deny yourself the experience if you can. it is totally worth it.",59.4

"ok, so the first thing i have to say here is that im in love with this game xd when i first saw the trailer for skyrim i was like: ohh...ok...another awesome video, filled with some good actions scenes and a lot of graphic magic to make it look better than the game really is..., meaning i liked the trailer but was kinda unsure if it was true to the game or if i was gonna be dissapointed to have an enhanced video and then the game would be below the expectations of it. but...this was the first time ever that a game completelly surprised me, i was blown away the first time i was able to play the game. skyrim trully delivered what it was offering in the trailer. its a big game and has a lot to explore and a lot of hours for the players to get lost in it xd its a massive game with a vast world to explore, lots of races to choose from to keep you satisfied, a bunch of weapons and spells to your hearts content, enumerous monsters and enemies to fight, so many roads and choices you can make to decide your fate in the storyline and you can be anything and follow each and every road in one single character, you dont have to start a new game to uncover all the paths in the game. of course if you want to fully explore the game to its limits you will have to play with other races to discover some tiny things that are specific to each race. you can be anyone and do almost everything is the game: be a hunter and slay wild animals; be a miner and explore the depts of mines and find rare minerals; become a fearsome warrior and fight for the rebels agains the empire; join the companions and become a fearsome beast and transform into a werefolf to fight your enemies; explore the dark arts and become an assassin to work for hire for the dark brotherhood; join the thieves guild and become a master in sneaking, lockpicking, stealing and killing your enemies with one blow without them even noticing you; join the college of winterhold, learn and practice to master all the spells to become a powerful arch-mage.... i could go on and on and on, on what you could do inside the game hehehe...........is that big :d i do advise to take some time to fully explore this game, this is not one of those games on wich you play like a speddy to get to the end and know the finalle. its a waste to go and play it like that so do take your time, explore and uncover its secrets, its gonna be worth it :) the controls and gameplay are very easy to master in a couple of minutes so you will move around like you own the place in no time. at first, you must take your time and explore the skyrim world to find all the locations you need to go. it consumes a bit of time (but you wont even trully notice it if youre doing quests), the less patient people might complain about it a bit but once you discover all locations you can teleport to that location anytime you want in the future, thru your map. map and menus are very easy to use as well and are very simple and well explained. you have every information you need explicit on your inventory and other menus. all the info for the quests is also there in the quests log, all you have to do is activate it and follow the arrows, litterally lol but be advised that in a few quests and side-quests you may not encounter all the work done for you to acomplish it and you need to do a little digging yourself. your character keeps evolving thru out the entire game(and after you end it as weel if you keep playing with the same character), it levels up as you use your powers, skills and as you finish quests, wich gives you some skill points to use as you see fit. i also strongly advise to always keep multiple saves, the game isnt all that glichy or even has a lot of bugs but, as every game, its not without its flaws. sometimes you might get stuck on a mission or an ai character might not be doing what it should...it autosaves but to prevent that from happening you should always keep an extra pair of saves, its not a big thing and it doesnt consume much time, it takes less than a minute to do it and it ensures that your game runs smoothdly and you can always go back if you did something wrong or if you wanna deal with a situation differently. ok this review is going long so ill just finish up by saying its a 5 star game for me and i strongly advise you guys to, at least once, try and play the game and dont jump into conclusions by what other people say, unless you have played the game yourselves.",102.1

"well,what can i say about skyrim(i am brazilan ,so if my english is not as good as it should be sorry)skyrim is a game about someone who wake up in carriage and is going to be executed be things he/she did or not ,everything could be just a mistake or this someone could have killed a whole city, a king or nothing,when someone is going to be executed when a dragon (that can be his worst enemy or a friend it depends of one little(or not) thing that i will say later) shouts and stops the executation of someone (ironically or not) saving his life, someone will later be helped by two mans, one stormcloak(nord rebels that want skyrim to be of the nords again, and destroy the imperials) and one imperial (imperial is a race and a faction the imperials want to stop the stormcloack and... i think is just this) someone is very lucky ,later he/she will or not discover that he/she can absorv dragon souls and use a thing called shout, and that he/she is something called dragonborn/dovahkinn ,this someonecan have great adventures , someone can own and build a house,get married,adopt a child,be a vampire or a vampire hunter,can defeat the first dragonborn/dovahkin ,ride dragons, help the daedra and get special artifacts as a reward,ride horses,fight giants,dragons,undeads,machines and other things, explore the dwemer/dwarve ruins,become the leader of the companions,the archmage of the college of winterhold ,the commander/or something like this of the imperial/stormcloaks ,and many many other things. but returning to someone what his story(that is the little thing)? what race is he/she? is it male or female? you decided and everything will happen in skyrim a beatiful place that has some dimensional problems like dead things starting to fly like... cows,dead bodys suddently dissapearing and other thigns skyrim is a open world rpg ,but what is special about skyrim? it is like a book that every time that you read a page another two pages appears on the book,you make your own decisions ,your own story or take a pre-made history and build made by other player ,make or use mods, that can add a little change or change the whole skyrim to something better or worst now my personal opinion, skyrim is the best rpg i played in my whole life, i hope you enjoy it and help this already big community of player become even bigger,if you have enough money i suggest you to buy it,then install take something to eat and drink sit in a comfortable place like your bed or a chair and put (if you have ) your headphones listen or not a music or skyrim soundtrack and have fun (ps: dont lost opportunities because you were playing skyrim)",132.9

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim, one of the most in-depth games you will ever encounter. many quests and stories to tell, you can instantly conjecture when you are born into the world of skyrim. in the beginning of the game, you emerge as a captive member held by the imperial army, captive from trying to cross the border of skyrim. sitting in the carriage with your fellow captive thieves and bandits, questioning where you are flowing. as youre held captive by the solders in the carriage, being carried over the roads to helgan. as youre being kicked off the carriage, held in your queues to your beheading, you notice your foes worried about a large scream across the lands of skyrim. as you place your head on the pedestal, ready for your penalty, the scream becomes stronger. all of the sudden, a dragon appears, landing upon the castle to your left, he speaks in his dragon tongue and destroys helgan. this is your time to escape, and begin your journey in the world of skyrim. who knows what this frozen land has in store for you. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a action role-playing game, allowing you to create and customise your character, join a race and choose how your character handles in dangerous encounters, there is a range of possibilities to role-play in the world of skyrim. the game is playable in a first person perspective or in a third person perspective, both can be toggled easily by using the scroll wheel. the game encourages you to freely roam the environment, finding dungeons, towns, abstract structures and a range of side-quests to find while following the main quest, this allows the player to freely choose which quests the player can freely choose to conquest. the atmosphere the world of skyrim creates is outstanding. viewing this frozen nation in its misfortune is interesting and viewing the world revovle around you. as you progress throughout of the story, you get view different cultures and view how people live in various cities as you progress through the story. you can fully view how people and what people are willing to do to survive the events and the catastrophe of the lands of skyrim. viewing the scenery at its best adds to the atmosphere, looking out into the distance and spotting the large mountains standing tall and superior with a hint of snow on the peak, ruins standing, capable of anything, do you dare to enter? then looking down the plains of land, grass blowing in the wind. the scenery an essential characteristic to the world of skyrim. graphically, the game is outstanding, this statement is considered even without graphical modifications. the game has high resolution textures, this being the ultra graphical setting, but if youre feeling curious, you can get even better textures with the free downloadable content that bethesda game studios offer. adding onto the graphical discussion on the elder scrolls v: skyrim is something i mentioned earlier, the scenery. the scenery is just breath-taking. if these visuals arent enough for you, the graphical modifications created by the community are phenomenal, i couldnt recommend more that you browse through some videos on youtube of them, but on the negative side, some are very intensive to your computer unlike the default textures. talking about the performance of the elder scrolls v: skyrim, the game is polished and the performance is outstanding. this is a enormous statement, but the game could almost run perfectly well on any pc. ive know many people who have ran the elder scrolls v: skyrim on a laptop without messing with any graphical settings, running smoothly of course. this truly shows the effort in the development cycle that bethesda game studios has put into the game. on the unfortunate side of this, i wish that the game was supported for multiple operating systems, but alternatives can be found to still play the game on different operating systems. content; the department that the elder scrolls v: skyrim does not disappoint. approximately the game has around 300 + hours of content, this isnt including modifications. if you feel that this isnt enough, you have modifications to add extra quests and various other content, the elder scrolls community is talented for creating these outstanding modifications. now finally, to the conclusion to the elder scrolls v: skyrim. this game is well worth every single penny, the amount of effort that the developers have established into this game. to you, the reader, i recommend you buy this game, take your time while playing the game to look at the detail this game contains because this game deserves the title along the side of the elder scrolls games.",28.5

"having played 90+ hours of skyrim this past week, i figured that i should write a review on it. first of all, i had to said this is an amazing sandbox+ rpg experience. i am someone who enjoyed doing side quests as well as misc quests as a mean to earn more money. i got to say that till now i had not finish the story as there are so much more to do. i was pleasantly surprised initially when i see people with over 2000~4000+ hours of gameplay time. all i can say is skyrim had just that much content especially if you include all the dlcs. i mean just building a single house took me more than 2 hours, not to mention the fact that i had to design and decorate my own house. it pretty much a chore that feel great after you are done with it. i am also barely done exploring skyrim after 90 hours in, the combat are extremely fluid and animated especially when you do a sneak attack. there are many other great elements in skyrim such as pick-locking which can be extremely frustrating but fun to play around with. i had never been this impressed with a rpg before and i definitely think skyrim is by far the best i had played so far for this price. i definitely recommend this game to every rpg lovers, you wont ever regret it especially if you enjoyed other rpg such as the witcher as well as fable.",147.3

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim: -field rating 9 -graphics 9 about graphics: -skyrim is a beautiful game, made even more beautiful by the extremely active modding community. the engine was a wonderful leap from the previous engine we saw in oblivion and the fallout series. the details in the environments are wonderful reminders of just how intricate the world really is. -gameplay 9 about gameplay: -skyrim lives up to its elder scrolls name, granting us the freedom to craft our own story, in a gigantic world where you can spend hours simply exploring. the combat has seen a huge improvement since the days of oblivion, with the ability to dual-wield chaning up gameplay styles wonderfully. the physics however, are still as wonky as ever. sometimes with hilarious results. you wont get tired of wandering around this world. -story 9 about story: enough interest to drive you forward, and plenty of lore to keep you distracted, skyrim finds the wonderful balance of permeating the world with the story, yet giving you the freedom to advance the plot when you wish. multiplayer: no depressingly: no. replay-ability: 9 -the only thing that will stop you from coming back to skyrim for awhile is completely burning yourself out. but then the cycle repeats. overall 9/10 -being a long time elder scrolls fan, skyrim was a welcome breath after the much loved, much played oblivion. the freedom, the scope, and the environment are great. the graphics are beautiful. though none of the elder scrolls since morrowind have yet captured the full extent of the magic that made morrowind so great, skyrim has been a huge push in the right direction. a must buy for any rpg or open-world gaming fan.",27.9

"wow. the only word that i can use to describe this game is misleading. i have over 320 hours on this game, and i have yet to even see the skyrim. ive tried googling the location of the rim, but to no avail. this game doesnt even have helicopters to use to even get to the rim! like, wtf activision? fix your game. this is the biggest waste of 74 euros ever. i even installed the beautiful males mod because i got tired of looking at battlefield to get me off, and that doesnt even do it. the  physics are atrocious. no flopping, no particle effects, nothing. why would you put naked men in the game if it isnt even arousing? i guess the snow is ok, but nowhere near the quality of the snow in that one level of call of duty. i cant remember which one, though. graphics - 2/10 gameplay - 1/10 (waaayyyy better on consoles)  physics - 2/10 (left too much to the imagination) snow - 6/10 (im being generous with this one) overall - 10/10 - a fantastic game with an amazing storyline. you can play it fer dayz.",0.3

"quite honestly, i thought i would regret buying this game again after having 100s of hours in it on xbox 360. oddly enough, i didnt. even after completing everything this game has to offer (which i might add, is a ton), mods give this game a complete new life. sure, skyrim isnt the best elder scrolls to date, but its pretty damn good. even if youve played it on a console system before, its not the same. this game is a must have for any rpg lover.",93.7
"skyrim is the perfect example of how a vast and addictive adventure game is done, without overloading the player with witcher-like  complexity. you begin the game picking only your race and from then, what type of fighter you are is completely built off of how you play, making for endless possibilities of the fighter you can become. it is a poor idea to just stick to the main story all throughout, because it will leave you at a disadvantage if you ignore the varying side quests and beautiful exploration, which allow you to uncover some of the best equipment as well as enhance your skills and levels. this in turn, has given me a massive playtime of 37 hours so far and the main story still only feels like its a quarter of the way through! this is a fantastic watercooler game, allowing for you and your friends to share hours of stories about your unique adventures and play style in skyrim. if you have the system specs and you love exploration, do not miss this game!",126.5
"my thoughts about this game: this game is just glorious upon my nipples!! :d it makes my nipples burn with joy, it gives me happiness and excitement!! i freaking love this game, ive played over 500 hours on it!! ;d this game is just the flawless victory trust me, buy it!! :d the bugs are basicly the only bad thing, but they get patched over time!! :d there are mods to this game also, they are the best of almost everything. :d the dawnguard dlc is just a glorious dlc. i love it!! :d the hearthfire dlc is good for the family man, the one and only. the dragonborn dlc seems pretty impressive and awesome for that matter. my grade: 9/10. // jimi.",494.4
"bethesda has done it again with an incredible open world game. skyrim has become one of my all time favorite games. i still find myself coming back and creating a new character over and over to experience this rich world. add all the dlc and the vast amounts of great mods, this game is a must have!",112.0
"tl;dr end of review. this game: -has a magnificent story. -cheats -awesome mods (nexus) -open world -do almost anything -and the list goes on. if i had more money, id buy 10 more copies of this game for anyone who really needs to play it. in this game you can: -go anywhere -kill anyone -scream -get married -buy a house -kill dragons -eat (dragon) souls without being a ginger -store a thousand item in your inventory -climb mountains on a horse -duel with losers ingame -travel -explore a wide vareity of places, cities, villages, dungeons and many more -have a cute lady follow you everywhere and defend you (better with sexy mods). too long, didnt read (tl;dr) -----buy this game, dont pirate it.----- -----the developers deserve more than pirated downloads of the game.----- -----this game is totally worth you $20 (or $5 if sales)----- support the developers, think about it, if you dont buy their amazing games, they may go bankrupt and not make good games like skyrim, fallout nv, dishonored, etc. then wed get stuck with  ea and ubisoft. you cant buy anything in this game for real money. it wouldnt rip you off. spend $20 for this game and play forever instead of buying another overpriced game from another game developing company. thanks for reading.",79.2

"first off, skyrim is a still a great game that sadly suffers from a number of issues. if you have played oblivion, you probably will be disappointed in the long run with skyrim because of the gameplay being dumbed in several ways. for example, the spell system is fun with the dual wielding but sadly they toke out the custom spell making and that was always fun as a mage in oblivion. combat is dumbed down alot but it is still decent because the elder scroll games never had the best combat. many of the qeusts and characters feel lacking in depth but i did expect this as bethesda isnt the greatest in those aspects of games like this. there are still a few good points in skyrim, despite the several flaws ive already pointed out. such as the better support for mods that bethesda has provided in cooperation with valve, workshop is great and the community behind the mods are great as well. these add so much gameplay hours that you can get double the hours if you install some mods, they even made me rebuy the game on pc with the dlcs. dlcs are lacking expect dragonborn(great expansion). generally it is way more stable then previous games even though it isnt perfect in this matter despite the flaws of the game, it still provides a great way to waste hours and one of the finest sandbox rpgs out there. however i recommend oblivion more then this game because of the fact that it is basically this but then way better imo.",131.4

"the game is very enjoyable but it has its problems. the enviroments and the feeling of the world is amazing. this is the strongest part of the game. the rest is sadly very mediocre. the combat is simple and spammy and lacks any serious depth considering its a rpg. exploring the world is cool and all but many of the places youll find are generic tombs that all look the same. the quests are a gamble, some of the questlines are great but some, not so much. the problem is that alot of the quests are mmo like gather x amount of these items quests. these kind of quests i feel do not belong in a singleplayer rpg like this. the game also artificially extends the game by having randomly generated repetetive misc - quests. at this point the game got really dull and i stopped playing when there was basiclly only these quests left. besides all of its faults though, it is a game worth playing and many do not seem to notice these things since skyrim brought in alot of people who usually do not play rpgs and has not gathered any pre - expectations. the game is overall a pretty dumbed down version from the previous entries in the series which makes me enjoy the game alot less. it is a very easy game and is designed for a more casual crowd then morrowind, oblivion or even the earlier ones. but as i said it is still a fair amount of fun and with an insane amount of mods, you could play this for a long time. id like to say though that for all people who love skyrim, you should atleast give tes iv : oblivion for i feel that some would enjoy that games more deep systems and harder difficulty. thanks for reading my rather lengthy review, i hope it helped you in your decision for buying the game.",169.8

"if youre expecting a game with loads of varied  to do and challenging, deep, gameplay mechanics, this game is not for you. if youre expecting a game thats like a superdrug in terms of addiction, then this is for you. people claim this game has infinite quests when it doesnt really. it has about an estimate of about 50 different kinds of missions from different factions that you can do over and over and over until those stats all reach 100. then you legendary them and start all over again; all in all this will probably take you 100 to 1000+ hours depending on the kind of stuff you do. luckily though, modders have salvaged this game into a truly infinite experience. im pretty sure any and all issues one might have with this game can be easily addressed with a mod on the workshop. my one and only problem with skyrim is that i never recall any distinct sensation of fun or memorability (aside from the clearly lovingly created world behind the game) to be had in the game outside of the thieves guild or the dark brotherhood, though that didnt stop me from playing it for several hours. thats why i find it hard to review this game. whether or not its worth a purchase depends on whether you play games for enjoyment or to kill your time. seeing as it accomplishes a colossal amount of time killing in comparison to most other aaa games regardless of the fact that most of it feels like busywork without any fun mods, i have no choice but to leave recommended and not a not recommended. i mean, in the end, this game captured my attention, and i still will likely go back to it for several more hours when i feel like getting back into the game. so didnt it accomplish what it set out to do? thats debatable, but its still worth a purchase on the basis that its a game that will hold off the need for other games for a while. and it goes on sale more often than most games, so its hard to truly go wrong with this game.",81.6

"years spent developing the elder scrolls v, after iv oblivion in 2006 and the work put into skyrim is evident. released in 2011, we are no longer able to call skyrim an up-to-date game yet it still tricks you in that sense with its breathtaking graphics, of which make the world around you feel beautiful whilst still portraying the hard, gritty coldness of the snowy nordic homeland. the main quest starts with you as a prisoner (again) in the middle of a civil war between the imperials who had gained control of skyrim and allowed everyone to live there, and the stormcloaks who are nordic rebels led by jarl ulfric stormcloak, who seem to only want nords in skyrim. on the verge of execution you find the dragons have returned and after having narrowly escaped with your life you set out to defeat the dragons, finding out you are dovahkiin, dragonborn. on top of this main quest there are quadrillions of side missions, all of which add fresh varieties to your time in skyrim and allow you discover more locations in the world around you; you can fight the great war with either the imperials or the stormcloaks, you can join the dark brotherhood and assassinate the emperor, you can join the college of winterhold and aspire to become arch-mage. the freedom in skyrim is incredible and the developers have made it so that all the decisions you make on your free roaming have an affect on your gameplay and quests, take a pilgrimage to the different temples, visit all 9 holds, join the thieves guild in riften, explore hidden caves and burial sites, hunt down daedra, the world is in your hands. then when you have done adventuring for the day, buy a house in one of the major cities and sit down to read one of skyrims hundreds of detailed books, all giving you more information about the elder scrolls lore and some helping you level up or start a new quest. in conclusion, i love the elder scrolls v: skyrim and recommend it to everyone, it is a fantastic game which will allow you hours of enjoyment and whilst it has nice graphics and good gameplay, actually is not very demanding in spec. my skyrim rating: 10/10 buy it!",96.5

"before i start this review, i need to clarify some things. i know, it doesnt look like ive played this game much, but i have played skyrim on consoles since its launch in 2011, and have logged over 300 hours on both the xbox 360 and ps3. now, on to the review. i have been wanting this game on pc ever since i had first built my gaming pc. i loved skyrim on the consoles, and i consider it the best rpg of the decade so far. part of me wanted it on pc for the mods, the other part for the benchmarking purposes. now that i own the game, i can see i was completely wrong. i have not in fact been getting the proper skyrim experience all these years, just a crappy console port. i had no idea how bad the graphics and loading times (if you have never played it on console, the loading times can take minutes) can hinder immersion. let me be the first to tell you, when i first played this game on console even, i was awe-struck by the beauty the game had to offer. the world is great, and although i prefer oblivions world to this, i still like this place. it is so majestic. when i got the game on pc and booted it up on max settings with the color mod, i was awe-struck all over again. the fast loading times blew me away, and the color mod showed how bland and disgusting the vanilla games color pallete is. the game on max settings or even low (console skyrim is at a setting below low) is great looking. not to mention the game in 60fps vs the 25 or so fps on console is absolutely breathtaking, it really makes a difference, and i am playing with a controller! i would warrant a purchase of this game for all the reasons above including the excellent mods of this game to anyone who already owns the game on console. now to the newcomers. the game is an rpg, and a big one. it has a huge open world, and basically drops you outside a cave and says, here, have a quest, but you can go kill a chicken if you want. did i mention there are huge dungeons to explore, weapons to find, and people to meet/kill?, and the feeling is awesome. it is basically a do-whatever-you-want-whenever-you-want kind of thing. the npcs in the game are believeable, and i sometimes didnt want to go on huge killing rampages massacaring whole towns like i did in oblivion or morrowind (provided the combat system worked xd). the detail in the game is immense, and you can tell the devs took their time with this game. honestly, i feel kind of wierd right now. i am here reviewing a game so big, its mind-blowing, and i cant think of anything to say about it. i dont want to ruin the experience for you, it is too good. do i recommend this game? yes, i couldnt possibly recommend it enough. the game is so good, i am skipping out on christmas eve movie night with my family to write this review. i think its time for me to join them, so i will leave you with a quote from the worlds wisest person: thou shall not have lived if ye havent played skyrim",8.8

"amazing game with an amazing open world, an amazing variety of items, an amazing background story and amazing stunning gameplay. i highly recommend it for any rpg fan with more than 20 hours of endurance for games. you can easily spend 200 hours in exploring things, crafting items, discovering new places, customize your character and many other things! but be warned: if youre one of those fast paced players with no patience for such games dont play it! also i recommend playing the other elder scrolls games or gathering some background information, because youll understand way more of the story and the world of tamriel if you do so. one of the best western rpgs ever made. play it for gods sake!",366.1
"base game: the game is pretty good. lots of content, but i feel that the combat could have been better. it feels like your attacks never really connect with the enemy and its like it swings right through them. story-wise, it was terrible. i never once was interested in the story, especially when fallout new vegas did such a good job in writing a few years back. controls are solid with the mouse and keyboard and audio is good, with some great music. graphically, it looks okay, but there are a ton of things that could have been improved on. if we compare both vanilla skyrim and fallout new vegas, i would prefer to play new vegas. however, if you somehow dont own skyrim, buy it. right now. my review above is extremely brief, assuming 99% of pc players have played skyrim. if you dont, let me tell you why its a must buy. one simple word. mods. skyrim has thousands of mods to improve pretty much everything. from graphical enhancements, companions, quests, weapons, spells, armor, monsters, town improvements, ui, player created homes and even complete climate overhauls. you name it, and it will more than likely be there. the game already has hundreds of hours content-wise and you can even furthur that. my game looks amazing, with excellent textures and lighting that make it look like next-gen. i have spell mods that enhance the mage combat; i added over 250 spells into my game to use on my foes. i downloaded enhanced blood; making blood look extremely realistic and satisfying when you slice someone open. i have added quests and have made the main towns look much more lively with the enhanced towns mod. the combinations are endless. skyrims vanilla is good. but it can be turned into one of the best games you will ever experience if you pick your mods correctly. pros: +loads of content +fantastic, atmospheric world +tons of locations that add variety +outstanding music and voice acting +intense combat +stunning graphics +customizable controls +replay value is insane +mods, mods, and more mods cons: -poor ui -weak main story skyrim vanilla: 7/10 skyrim w/ mods: 10/10",172.5

"well, i have owned and played every bethsheda game execpt this one until recently. i was hesitant to purchase this game as i still have other rpgs yet to explore. i decided to atleast read some of the reviews and i must say i have never seen so many positive reviews about a game on steam. of course with so may people raving about this game i decided to give it a try. as with other games in the elder scrolls fanchise the endless play, do what ever you want, be whoever you want, stlye of game play is most appealing and much fun. the lack of game markers on quest makes it a little difficult at first but there is a spell, ability that corrects this after a few level ups. the quest are engaging and fun but the crafts and side quests are also great and so many that it can seem overwhelming at first. this game literally is endless as many people have put 300+ hrs into the game and are still loyal and continue playing. this is a game that can keep you entertained for years. with the steam workshop there are hundreds of mods that can be downloaded and enjoyed so you never get bored and always find something new and challenging to do. i take my time with this game as it can literaly ruin your social life. and you find yourself playing for hrs at a time. i am not going to let this happen to me. lol but be warned, this game is addicting. dont take my word or anyone else for that matter. purchasse and install this game as see it for yourself!!! 9/10",28.8

"my review for the elder scrolls v skyrim: - various races with their different abilities (you can even become a cat or a lizard too). you can be a boy or a gurl (and im not prof. oak). - a lot of quests (really guys, maybe i can finish most of unrepeatable quests, but by the time ive done that, i probably spent more than 1000 hours. - the map is vast, a lot of point of interest, and by the time you unlock every one of them, your maps gonna be full and heavier. duh. - travel skyrim as the mighty dragonborn, a warrior who can master every kind of weapons and magic, and also have a dragon blood running through your veins, which is nice. oh, and you can also shout with the dragon language. so you can curse people without them understand it. because two things, one, they literally dont understand what youre saying, two, theyre probably dead, cuz dragon language rulez. fus ro dah. - even though you are destined to be the mighty dragonborn, you can, and you should seek part-time job. you can be a blacksmith, potion or poison brewer, equipment enchanter, whatever that is. - you can join a group of mercenaries, magic nerds, bunch of kleptomaniacs, or fraternity of murderer. oh, you can also become vampires, or against them (blade will be proud), and have your own castle (you have to share with your fellow hobos, though. - oh, and you can marry, too. good for you, forever alone. - you can drag dead bodies whenever you want, throw junk whenever you want, and the guard still ignoring you. - this game is moddable, original is great, with mods, no question asked. 9/10",210.7

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim. its just one of those gems in gaming where as soon as when you get into it you may lose the way out. i originally played skyrim and its official expansions on the ps3 version on their release days and i havent played a game that good in a long time. time spent was nothing impressive for elder scrolls standards though mind you its just roughly +400 hours or so on the main save playing as a khajiit with a warrior/assasin build & playstyle. sword > shield later 2 words and from a bow i went to a dwarven crossbow (dlc wep) what makes this game so much fun is that its easy to learn for users both new and not so new how to play it. you start of with whatever weapons and armor you can scavenge, steal, craft or be gifted and one step at a time as time flies by you discover and learn new ways to improve your skills and armor. all you have to do is pick up any weapon you like and use it in combat. tired of that same sword? purchase a bow! bow too boring? craft a hammer! the options really nearly endless. skyrim is also one of those games that is not only about fighting and exploring either. you can buy your own house, you can get married and live a happy life together or alone. handy to know for some of you out there is that this game allows players the choice to start same sex relations, i know its been a debate and a gaming media thing so for that exact reason im just gonna throw it outta there it in hopes it might be useful for anyone who find this important. but back to the home thing. in the hearthome expansion pack (5,00 $5,00 steam store) the home and marriage feature gets a nice big upgrade which gives you the ability to get a plot of land at 3 set locations and build your own house from scratch starting with a small simple cottage to perhaps a huge manion complete with kitchens, bedrooms, armories, and livestock which you can decorate as you see fit. if you meet the criteria it also allows you to adopt up to 2 children to raise as your own and adopt a pet (note: please adopt meeko). again the possibilities are nearly endless. for those who like to turn a page or two and read something in their own time about the history of skyrim or simple daily things like spear polishing and putting bread in the oven the elder scrolls v: skyrim has more than 1000 pages of lore spread through all of skyrim covering many topics such as history, myth, monsters, races, religion, art, and more. these books are found in caves, homes, stores and pretty much anywhere people have been. be on the lookout some of them are actually pretty fun to read. to sum things up skryim is a masterpiece any player can easily lose the time on pure from the many features and near perfect constructed world. be warned! all the best!

"bueno, con casi 300 horas, y varias partidas que la gran mayora nunca lleg a compeltarlas al 100%, pero esta ltima si, hago mi anlisis personal, que no tengo intencin para nada de hacerme el reviewer poniendo grficos, sonido y todo eso porque no lo soy, sin dar mi opinin y ya est. el juego en si me gust, es laaargo, graaaande y jugoso (e.e) muchsimas horas si te dispones a explorar todo al 100%, y ms an en hacer las misiones secundarias tambin al 100%, contando las del gremio de ladrones, hermandad oscura, los compaeros, el colegio de hibernalia, cada una contando con su propia historia interesante interna (mi favorita de todas son las de la hermandad oscura). el problema est, en que, aunque sea tan largo y grande el mapa con tantas misiones secundarias, a partir de cierto nivel se empieza a tornar muy repetitivo, al ya superar la etapa de reto que sera desde lvl 10-45, si es que no usaste una de las 1.000 maneras de conseguir armas dadricas rpidamente desde el comeinzo y ya tener el juego en tu bolsillo, al igual que los dragones, que los primeros son de verdad un reto e impresionan, pero ya cuando vas por el nmero 5 y ves que siempre hacen lo mismo, ese efecto se va rpido. me gustaron ms las misiones de las facciones que nombr antes, que la propia trama principal, y ni hablar de las de la guerra civil, que luego de acabarlas sientes que no cambi absolutamente nada en el juego, salvo algunas cosas que te repiten una y otra vez los npcs al entrar en ciudades. en cuanto a los logros, saqu todos, no son difciles para nada, sin que lo complicado es que llevan tiempo y requieren atencin a posta si se quieren conseguir algunos (el que ms me cost fue el de matar a un dragn legendario, ya que salen solo a partir del nivel 78, y yo termin el juego y todas sus misiones secundarias sienod lvl 60-65, pero con subir discrecin, resetearla (se agradece que agregaran esa opcin) y volverla a subir, bast con media hora o 1 hora para logar subir esos niveles que faltaban. al igual que el logro de hacer un objeto con el mineral del dlc dragonborn, que si o si necesitabas herrera a 80 y el perk de crear armaduras de bano para poder hacerlo. una de las cosas que tiene muy a favor el juego, es su grn comunidad de mods, tanto en workshop como en skyrim nexus, una gama de mods gigante de distintos tipos y para todos los gustos (yo opt por los grficos y poco ms la verdad, no me gusta llenar de mods un juego hasta el punto que ya deja de ser skyrim y se vuelve otra cosa, obviamente respeto al que lo haga, pero si tienes que llenar de mods un juego para que te guste.. deh, para eso no lo jueges, no?. un pequeo punto malo, que no es del juego sin de los mods, es que pueden bugearte o cagarte misiones, como me pas a mi con la hermandad oscura, que jams apareci el  mensajero que si o si tiene que darte una nota para comenzar la misin, hay formas de iniciarla igualmente con comandos en la consola, pero es intil, ya que ms adelante, al forzarla con la consola la misin, hay personajes que no aparece donde tendran y bueno, pasa lo que pasa. resumiendo todo el corn que puse arriba, el juego me entretuvo porque son mi droga los juegos de exploracin y con muchas misiones secundarias, pero en cuanto a historia principal tambalea y creo que mucho, siento que todas las cosas que hago durante el juego apenas influyen en skyrim ms que en dilogos forzados o situaciones que hsata me dan verguenza ajena como me tratan de restregar las cosas que hago para hacerte sentir hey, salvaste el mundo! y todos cojiendo en las granjas sin siquiera saber que alduiun casi se los viola, tiene demasiada fama el juego, y por lo nico que lo disfrut es por la enormidad del mapa, el lore de los dragones, los dwemers y los elfos de las nieves (falmers) por eso es que disfrut ms la trama de los dlcs que la del propio juego (salvo la misin del muro de alduin la parte donde esbern narra todo, es lo nico que en serio me interes profundamente de todas las misiones primarias, adems del asunto de los thalmor. es un poco triste que me haya atrapado ms esas historias internas que salen en libros o en misiones secundarias, que la propia trama principal en si misma. (tengo que aclarar que los libros son cientos y algunos son de verdad hermosos porque te cuentan cosas que el juego creo que ni siquiera tendra las herramientas para hacerlo). recomiendo comprarlo cuando est en rebaja, el precio de los dlcs me parece exageradsimo para lo que duran jajaja, aunque la historia para mi valiera la pena de los 2.",294.5
"my 400+ hours in game ought to say something about the vastness of the game world and the wisdom of paying whatever this game currently costs to play it. even in morrowind, i think i never spent more than 120 hours total. ive played daggerfall, morrowind, and now this game and the mmo beta in the franchise. every time the elder scrolls takes a step forward, it seems to lose some things that made me a fan of the series earlier on, while expanding upon others--for better or worse. i miss the ability to buy a sailing ship, to craft any sort of spell (even levitation), and to make any sort of class i wanted. i dont like that you can simply be just about everything to everyone if you follow all the different quest lines to completion. i dont like that you have to choose between two sides that suck in a war in order to enjoy certain added benefits and plotlines. i find it irritating (spoiler alert) that the imperials should be such a bland bunch of lackeys led by someone who apparently has real virtue--until you assasinate him, while the other side seems like a good bunch of warriors led by such an uninspiring, self-important primadonna. i especially find it irritating that although you can be all things to all people in all plotlines, with the one exception of being forced to choose between two equally uninspiring sides, the one thing you can never be is ruler, no matter what you do. you can kill dragons, and even emperors, but you cannot do anything to become ruler of skyrim. seems kind of silly to me. okay, so maybe skyrim would never welcome an argonian to rule over them... but if were going to play the reality card, well, theres a lot lacking in the major plotlines in that respect. i also dont like that youre forced into a few things that i find personally detestable once you initiate a given quest. i wouldnt recommend letting anyone under 18 play this game either as there are too many mature moments. even so, with all its glaring faults, this has been my favorite game in the series to date. i whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy rpgs.",423.2

"-skyrim; im not sure how i can review this, never having played older tes games, but i can safely say, after a better playthrough, this is a good game. -gameplay is pretty varied, ranging from full-on combat, using magic, or my all-time favourite: sneaking. -combat... isnt brilliant. it isnt stiff like a rock, but still a bit rough. it has some dinamic though, like executions, different attacks for different directions, and special effects like extra damage on undead, or freeze damage on stamina and magicka, etc. -as for quests, i feel like the game really shined in the guild quests, the companions, college, and thieves. but was lackluster on early-game story missions. that being my opinion though. -side missions are interesting at least, but some are/seem boring and occupy space on your journal. -the leveling system works a bit weird, differently from what im used to. by getting good at a skill: one handed, destruction spells, lockpicking you gain overall exp, then you use tab and click level up, not fully fond of it. -overall, id give it an 8/10 since a max rating has to be a perfect game for me, and i have not found one yet. -leave your feedback below. thanks",42.5

"skyrim is an amazing single player action/adventure rpg, massively recommend to any who love large open worlds and open gameplay. even if you confine yourself to just the main quest, this is still quite a large scale game. if you delve deeper into the side quests for factions, and randomized mini quests, you can easily put hundreds of hours in this game. this game is open to a lot of gamers - and difficulty is adjustable in the options so you can still play a fun game even if you aren not the quickest or slickest gamer. combat requires you to make good decisions on default difficulty - one bad mistake and you will be dropped quick. when i state the game is open - it is in different styles as well! skyrim has very open advancement, and many opportunities to advance your skills in either magic, combat, or stealth (or a combination of all). you are not as restricted as in previous elder scrolls games (and they were very open). skyrim even has perks - skill points you can place on skills to improve their function even more than leveling up. great for those who like skill trees! before i hit negatives: i recommend if you intend to play this for more than the main story - research console commands (the ~/` key). i dont recommend using them to ruin the core gameplay (it is possible), but you can use them to work around certain bugs, and annoying issues that can occur and ruin your fun. on the negative side - even with the game patched up - there are bugs. i recommend highly making multiple save files, and frequently. you may play constantly without running in to bugs, but some play and constantly end up needing to reload. my playstyle is very explorative - i will get stuck in the environment and need to load again. occasionally important - but not required - npcs will be killed through random events and attacks. this can be frustrating when you go to a town ready to unload items for sale only to find the shop keepers body outside and a pack of death hounds nearby. also in the negatives - the hoarder gameplay style is not conducive to this game. skyrim imposes a strict carry limit. when you exceed this limit, you slow to a crawl, and cannot run, or fast travel between places. this means you may literally spend an hour or more walking slowly from a dungeon back to town if you are a hoarder who keeps and/or sells all items! some players tend to use the console commands to increase their carry limit - but this does defeat part of the core gameplay concept - it is your choice though. overall - i thoroughly recommend this game. though not as innovative as some of the other elder scrolls games, this is still an incredible achievment despite any bugs or issues encountered.",119.6
"offers endless hours of fun, whether it be completing the engaging story missions, the countless number of side quests that keep you occupied or just running about killing everything that comes into sight. skyrim includes numerous armours, weapons and items, with the ability to craft many of them yourself. this collection can be ever expanded with the almighty world of modding, one of the best things the elder scrolls series is known for in my opinion.",225.9
"what to say about this game? its fun, exciting and teaches you to fly.. after you foolishly try beating up a giant. its got something for everyone, no matter what your favourite play style. like charging at the enemy? grab a suitable sword and get hacking.... enjoy stealing stuff.. theives guild for you, and you can always do worse than joining the mages guild, calling yourself tim the enchanter and spending your days blowing up bits of the landscape, before mocking a passing party of knights. stir in a civil war, plenty of side quests, odd jobs, not so odd jobs, and just plain weird jobs and youve already spent 100 gaming hours exploring one huge sandbox of a game world before youve even tried starting the main quest. does the game have its faults? of course. the menu system could be better for us pc users, and the 3rd person kill cam breaks the illusion while you are in the midst of a huge battle. but all in, its worth the money and gets a boris rating of 9 gallons of napalm out of 10.",223.9

"skyrim was one of the most-anticipated games of 2011, and you can see an amazing amount of polish and detail from bethesda in some of the changes theyd made to the engine since previous elder scrolls games. no make your own class, character progression is even more free-flowing this time around. skills rank up and become more effective as theyre utilized, with a bonus based on how well-rested your character is and which mystical standing stone youve most recently attuned to. this allows a character to jump back and forth between more-efficiently raising mage-style skills, warrior, and thief abilities. character level increments as enough ranks are gained in these skills. enemies level with the character, but are locked at the level they were when you first entered that area. cave of necromancers just too hard for you? leave, come back in five levels. it means that fresh encounters will always be challenging, but rarely overwhelming. the combat/interaction mechanics are updated so that theres a right-hand/left-hand, left-click/right-click mechanic. this allows the player to wield a spell, weapon, or shield in one hand and something complementary in the other. two versions of the same spell can eventually be dual-cast to improve effects, and this mechanic also puts a new spin on the two-handed, sword-and-board, and dual-wielding melee combat. skyrim is a very open, living realm with lots to do; so much, in fact, that it may be a tad overwhelming. everyone wants something from the dragonborn. theres discrete quest chains for the main storyline (save the world from a world-eating, immortal dragon who goes about resurrecting his dead dragonbros), the mages college (where a character who barely knows how to use magic can rise to the very top, not that many will notice), the fighters guild (by any other name) that introduces some helpful companions and a new way of becoming something that goes bump in the night, the assassins guild (with tales of love, madness, betrayal, and sticking pointy things into others), and a far-reaching, long-spanning saga for the humble thieves guild of riften thatll send you all across the continent as the stakes get higher and higher. honestly, the last two seem to dwarf the real plotline, but your mileage may differ. aside from (and included in) those, you have any number of random minor fetch, kill, and other classic quest-types, some of which use the new semi-random-generation radiant quest system. theyll never run out, and rarely repeat, but generally are just there so that you know you can always do quests; theyre rarely worth it. so, whether you want to play a stealth-based archaelogist trying to snatch precious nord treasures from the powerful undead draugr guarding them, a shield-bashing, axe-swinging juggernaut with shouts powered by the stolen souls of freshly re-killed dragons, or a crafty mage with a penchant for bringing in daedra friends to do her bidding, skyrims got options for you. theres rough spots, theres high points, but its a great example of a proficient studio kicking out a aaa flagship title. as for dlcs, ill likely review those on their own.",257.8

"a game that enables you to play as either gender and personalise your character to the last detail is always going to gain my interest. a game where you can ride horses, use magic and beat the  out of dragons is definitely going to gain my interest. a game that isnt linear, is packed with fantasy and lets you wear badass armour and make or find formidable weaponry is.... yeah, you get the point. skyrim is just so full of everything that you couldnt play it the same way twice. right from the beginning, you can choose the type of person you are going to be. a sneaky thief, a wizard, a hero, an assassin, an annoying git; you can follow whichever path you feel like and change it daily, if you want to. you can build houses and adopt children. you can punch random people in the head. you can start bar fights. you can murder innocents. you can adopt stray doggies. you can marry in a same sex marriage (well played for beating the uk at this). you can save villages. you can wreak havoc in villages. you can make enemies of an entire race of people. you can assassinate kings or make them kiss your butt. i could go on... even if you dislike the concept of magic and prefer the down and dirty physical combat like i do, the game does not disappoint. the storyline retains its relevance throughout and keeps you absorbed. and i havent even mentioned the incredible, contrasting scenery yet. highly, highly, recommended. i didnt even like rpgs before i played skyrim, and now i am searching in vain for a game to live up to it.",125.5
"skyrim is a complicated game to review, even after all these hours. in its original form it is somewhat lacking. ive seen the phrase wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle used in reference to skyrim and i understand why. for all its virtues are substantial vices, trade-offs that may be necessary but have a tangible effect on the overall experience. allow me to elaborate. the sense of exploration comes at the cost of individual locations rarely being very memorable, with few exceptions. the sense of freedom comes at the cost of a truly strong narrative: the return of dragons as heralds of the apocalypse at alduins claws never becomes as fleshed out as it could have been. this is supposed to be a nation at civil war and a world on the brink of annihilation, but that never really shows in game in a very tangible way. the story elements of the game have plenty of telling, but comparatively little showing. even aside from direct story, most characters are simply there for the sake of existing. few are more than 2-dimensional, or for that matter worth remembering. paarthurnax is the stand out for me personally. i dont expect every npc to be relatable or have clear backstory. that would be ridiculous, in a game this size. still, while its understandable its still grating after a while. the game play is simplified compared to its predecesors, as im sure you have heard people complain about. this isnt entirely a bad thing, but remains a matter of taste. i found some elements of morrownd and oblivion more complex than truly necessary, while others will see skyrim as stripped down in comparison. to be fair, it is. objectively, features and gameplay elements have been removed. how much that affects your enjoyment is another matter. i enjoyed both skyrim and its predecessors despite their differences. so if vanilla skyrim has flaws and virtues in equal measure, is skyrim still worth getting? yes. it cannot be overstated how much difference mods can make for this game. new lands to explore, expanded gameplay elements for vampirism and lycanthropy, more weapons and armor, better hair and face models... if you can think of it, someone has probably got a mod for it. this makes skyrim customizable in a way few other games can boast. if youre willing to make the effort of learning to mod it, the game is absolutely worth it. if youre not, it may be best to wait for a sale. it gets a price drop on a near-constant basis, so chances are you wont need to wait long.",288.5

(if you some how mannage to do all the side missions or you just want to start a new character) there is many diffrent perks to make it easier for your playstyle, for example if you are a mage you might want to get a perk for destruction magic so it does more dammage or increse your enchanting so you can make your armor give you a magic bonus. the music is great with an awesome main theme that playes when you fight dragons. the main story is about a dragon that appeared out of nowhere summoning other dragons back to life so it is up to you, the dragonborn to stop them. the side missions also have storys that dont even require you to have beat the main story with intresting plot twists in the middle. skyrim has tonnes of mods that are simple to get from the workshop and can make this game crazy with mods that give you insane wepons, armor and missions. skyrim is probably my favorate rpg ever and i highly recommend it to any openworld rpg fan. i also recommend buying the legendary edition because the dlc adds some fun content that adds plenty more hours of gameplay.",210.7
"my favorite rpg game ever created. in my opinion, it is a huge step up from oblivion. leveling is smoother, combat is much more realistic and varied, and there are just so many things that skyrim adds to the game that were missing in prevous games. this game also has my favorite graphics out of any game i have seen, which isnt bad for a game that is around 2 years old now. i highly recommend this game if you are a fan of the previous elder scrolls games, or just enjoy medieval type rpgs in general. bethesda did not dissapoint and their reputation for creating great quality games still stands.",222.6
"this is a great game it has a great story line, lots of action, and hours of gameplay, one of the best ive ever played",147.9
"if you are ever forced into a situation where you can only buy one game on your pc then make it a bethesda game and make it morrowind. unless you want to have epic battles with dragons then make it skyrim. as usual this game is one that impacts an entire generation. an absolutely massive game, with solid mechanics, beautiful graphics and an  ton of glitches. thankfully, due to the massive moding community you can fix everything in a few seconds and then take the game to an entirely new level that is customized to your personal tastes and persuasions. more gushing about the game can be found here on my blog, which is the blog to end all blogs:",212.8
"this is truly one of the best games i have ever played. an epic tale that allows you to play it however you want to. along with steam community and an entire modding community behind skyrim, the possibilities and adventures are endless. if you have not tried out the epicness of skyrim, i recommend picking it and living it yourself.",92.9

"do i recomend this game... hell yes! ive been so busy playing the game, i never wrote a review, i have played this game far more than any other game i have tried, and with all the mods from various places, the game possabillites are endless. i would get into some of my personal mods i am using, but i will spare you the details other than possible infestations and pregnancies. the balance of the vanilla game is great, and it happens to be a great starter for one to play. i use the creation kit to make changes so i dont have to run to town before getting half way through a single dungeon, and i tried on several aspects to increase rank wise for aditional perks in different areas. like for use of 4 enchantments instead of 2, but it is set up where you can only up it once, not 3 times, so was forced to hit 4 directly. and same thing with increased carriing capacity, allows for only a single upgrade to it. am still a novice, or i would change the base settings to add more branches off that one. once you learn the controls, that are quite simple, game play is smooth, combat is not really my thing in most games, but in this game, it keeps me going back for more, on a regular bassis, difficulty is moddable while in game, even in battle, to make the boss fights a bit easier if needed... ok, there is just too much for me to say about this game, and after speaking with friends, this is the last true elder scrolls game, as the online version totally sucks, and not even made by the same team that made this game, shame shame... anyway, this is the game i play, as my times show, and will continue to grow as time wears on, and new mods become available as 3rd party content, i will add it to my game such as,become a lord in my case, lady... should just say jarl so there is no gender differientials... ok, back to my game, have to kill aulduin for the 10th time....",1761.0
"the epic atmosphere that wraps this chapter of the tes saga is stunning, allowing the player to dive into a magic world on the edge of a crysis felt never before. the gameplay is quite simplified compared to the previous chapters, nonetheless it still gives a special insight into the fantastic lore of the elder scrolls. 10/10",292.8

"one of the best games ive ever played. you can go for hours just getting sidetracked from one quest to another and then again. some people didnt like that, but the whole open-world aspect and freedom to do whatever you want makes for one of the most enveloping and immersive gaming experiences designed to date.",171.5
"with an endless possibility of adventure, and a great modding community, the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best rpgs ever made. however, it suffers from rehashed dungeons and character models, along with familiar scenery in some places. none of that is enough to draw away from the incredible depth, scale, and intensity of tamriel. the province of skyrim is an incredible place to trek, but many of the events that happen in the game feel immersive at first, before revealing themselves to be a similar, if not exactly the same, endeavor each time. for example; a fugitive runs up and gives you a sword and a threat. this makes you feel like youre in a living, breathing world, only to have that breath extinguished when you realize itll be the same situation again and again and again as long as a fugitive needs your help. rehashed content is the only drawback to an otherwise truly one of a kind rpg.",255.5
"words would result insuficient to describe what skyrim is and what it has to offer. from a first view it has no brilliant story and there are indeed some bugs or glitches that still remain, so it could possibly result a mediocre game but i assure you that youll certainly change your mind after trying it, what makes skyrim special is the identification in your character, made possible by a levelling system different from the classic rpg. you wont have points to spend in any abilities (except for health, mana and stamina) but youll have to select a few skills and upgrade them by practice. this will risult more immersive for the time spent in the levelling process and for the result of that, more rewarding than a normal rpg lvl system: the more the effort will be the more rewarding will be the result, that wont be tranlated in a mere number. in every game your will be at the center of all things but skyrim will make you feel to deserve being the hero. a little sore in all of that could be the lacking of a karma system, much more familiar to all the fallout saga players, (but cmon world needs to be saved from ancient badass flying lizards; embending a pot in the the head of the innkeeper to avoid him seeing you stealing some chease will be surely forgiven by akatosh). last but not least the music the will make more suggestive the beautiful landscapes in the whole game (better to install graphic mods for best quality) and will make every battle worth to be fought, even though the fight system isnt anything special. after almost 240 hours ive still havew to finish the game because the feeling that i get from it was that every inch of rock, earth, mud and water has to be lived and so every little adventure the this land of the north will offer you (yes, also the blackreach quest for the nirns roots, still unfinished though..). in the end, skyrim is maybe one of the best games ever createwd by now, and together with dark souls 1 and 2 helped made me develop a certain sensibility towards games and what they try to transmit you, not simply living them as fictional/interactive stories for childish plays or a simple waste of time as grown ups people see them. 10/10 (if you get the chance, play the dlcs aswell).",235.9

"i can personally attest to the fact that skyrim deserves all the hype its gotten. one of my favorite aspects of the game is the fact that it isnt a mainstream, overly-colorful, slightly too fantasy-oriented rpg, that ends up being a bit cheesy. instead, skyrim has created a beautiful, yet rugged world in which anything is possible (especially with mods), and provides enough realism and strategy to be intense, while still being a fantastic, mythical experience that leaves you awe struck and nerd-gasming. play this game, i beg you.",433.9

"this game is beautiful and it has soul. while i think its not the best tes game, it surely stays true to what makes this series amazing: insanely detailed world, fantastic atmosphere, the huge open world that calls the adventurer in me to explore every corner and delve into the legends of the nords. the art style, music and character models make skyrim the most spectacular experience so far in terms of a living world to explore. the rpg mechanics are getting thinner (stats, skills, birthsigns, attributes) but the progression and character customization are still pretty solid in their absence and a good improvement from oblivion. i cant wait for the expansions for this game.",624.5

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is everything gamers expected and more. as the follow-up to oblivion, arguably one of the best rpgs of all time, people expected a lot and bethesda delivered. thats not to say that skyrim is without problems, far from it. fortunately, there is so much good in all of skyrim that the problems are easy to ignore. ill start off by saying that if you didnt like the combat in previous elder scrolls games, you probably arent going to change your mind with skyrim. that being said, combat has changed fairly significantly. the biggest change is in the addition of dual wielding. in previous games, you could assign a one-handed weapon and a shield, or a two-handed weapon and then add a magic attack via right bumper. in skyrim, you have far more freedom to equip what you want. basically, everything that uses one hand can be equipped as long as you have a hand available. also, magic now counts as using up an equipped hand. what this means is, you can use two one-handed weapons to dual wield at the expense of blocking, sword and shield (of which the shield now has attacks of its own such as shield bashing), a sword and magic spell, or two magic spells. all of these combinations also feel much weightier and no longer feel like the crowbar from half-life. hits feel like hits, magic spells feel like they are doing significant damage and blocking gives you a sense of danger avoided. if you do go the melee route, youll still get a bit of a sense of button mashing but its still a big step up from oblivion. rating: viking life 9.5/10",253.0

"i recommend this game. bethesda have desgined and created a true masterpiece. the elder scrolls series is some really great lore, the feel it has is so immersive, more so to our own i feel, and i have to say, slightly more so than j.r.r tolkiens lore on middle earth. skyrims feel is no diffrent to the other games in the franchise, altho i must admit i havent had the pleasure of expieriencing any of them other than a small 1 hour, 1 death play of morrowind, skyrim, of course, in fact i believe to have over 2000 hours of gameplay in skyrim, as i play on the xbox 360 most of my time, and my fellow brethren allow me to indulge them in some lore and ill do some roleplay with their character which we dont mind. oblivion also, ive had many an adventure in the realm of oblivion and cyrodill, i even have the game manual and every dlc, paid full price as on the xbox. probally countless more hours on that game, and im definatley familiar with lore in the elder scrolls, however, the freedom and power that come with playing and being immersed in an elder scrolls game is unlike any other, thanks to bethesda softworks and many other countless reasons :oo: the impact it has on the way at least i think, is significant, makes me want to roleplay,and i shall set out and weave my own fate, outsatanding..... :) if you play skyrim, and your rig, whatever you play on. be it laptop, linux i think you can run it on? mac, anything i guess, if its about the average, i say you definatley should get some mods running with skyrim, it only matters that you have the right and required system/rig, to run it on if you want graphical mods, or highly increase data and such, otherwise, not so important. you would want to go to nexus mods and community, on the web, and search on catorgorys for anything your interested in. also before i tell you what i have, you will need to know how to install mods, if you dont already know, of course if you are unsure of anything you may not want to mess anything up or waste your time to try it, for a great guide on how to do almost everything with mods, search youtube for gopher, and watch his video on, well anything, hes a great guy and he explains all you need to know better than most people do that ive seen haha. hope you get through that alright, and really, if your under 10 years old, which its sort of illegal or breaking some rules if you are, to play the game exetra, you might find it hard to understand, skip things and not do what you need to correctly, causing things to get messy and possibly broken. dont take shortcuts (follow the guidence/trail) you can ask me anything on the matter too id be happy to oblige. personally i have many* about 50 immersion modifications (mods) and more gameplay effects and changes, also maybe 5 overhauls, one for each, audio, combat, skills, enviroment, gameplay, and a complicated one. well its a long list of around 600 alltogether modifications, bare in mind that some of theese are about 3kb in size, so i could somehow merge together all the files ive found and downloaded and get to only have 50 or so mods, but not really necesary, with nexus mod manager. basically, modifications personalise to your dreams and taste, give you what you want and possibly more, there are about 25000 modifications to be found on the site and many more to come, you can always create and add yourself, skyrim is endless then and truely magnificicant. if we were to modify older tes games it just wouldnt live up to skyrim modded as it is down to technology, but can give you endless more time playing with excitement and emotion, and even merging other realms, ooohhh hah (: so much to tell you i could, i guess if you want to know more id be a good start to ask on, and your welcome to. it is a great life expierience to explore and adventure skyrim, turn hud off at the start if i were you, to be more immersed, and if you will add mods, play through the beggining untill you are unbound and start to configure, and do not forget to save! oh thats another thing, if you have more than 4 saves it usuallyy caused loads of problems, like crash to desktop and corruption with data, that sort, so limit your saves wisely. just to say, there is a mod made for skyrim, for littrally 60% of what ever you think of, and if not, make it :), hardly limmeted, i dont know how to say to people that they should start playing it... if you, are hungry for adventure, seek the land of skyrim! fare well..",712.1

"with an almost endless amount of immersion, skyrim is a fantastic game that hosts a multitude of mods. vanilla skyrim is in itself fairly well made, and the story is at just the right level of length where i dont feel frustrated at spending half my day traversing a dungeon. the puzzles, when apparent, arent too difficult and the graphics are still great even to this day, if youre that sort of gamer. also, this game is quite liberal on mods. hell, they even provide you with a tool to do it yourself, and some mods are just breathtakingly beautiful. others are so immersion and lore-breaking you love it and simultaneously wither on the inside, but you download them anyway. now here comes the part where i warn you about stuff thats important mmk lets do this thing skyrim is an extremely volatile game especially with dawnguard and hearthfire, but youll only really see this in heavily modded cases of skyrim...or maybe not. since bethesda refuses to fix most of the problems users have reported, there are mountains of threads to fix these issues, although some of them are not guaranteed to work. a mod that conflicts with another can ctd you incredibly quickly (or mess up your save/saves). and by ctd, i mean crash to desktop, and thats never fun. i currently have my mod settings for skyrim at modded to a degree that its on life support so im crashing somewhat frequently. secondly, skyrim is a memory hound and this also makes it freak the hell out on occasionally. unless your machine is a powerhouse, expect a little lag. the cursor tends to go from jerking erratically to being as slow as a dump truck, according to your settings. edit #1: on the topics of mod compatibility, this is an issue youll eventually run into with important mods. although most of them are self-sufficient, youll run into that mod, the one that lags you out/bugs something or even messes your save up eventually, and this translates to all saves down report bravo team. ahem. now, with something like 5 mods installed it shouldnt be hard to find a problem. with say, 100, this is much more of a problem, especially with skyrims lack of communication when it ctds. its a tedious process, so be warned and be careful on what mods you download, you never know whatll break your game a few times before fixing it. or, you know, not. i love this game despite its (sometimes)fatal flaws and ill continue to play it any day. thanks for muscling through this wall of text.",232.2

"no spoilers in this review dive into the shoes of the dragonborn saving the world like usual in an elder scrolls game but with a twist, you can use the ancient power of the voice to shout words of power shout at your enemies. the world eater has returned along with the dragons and it is up to you to defeat them and save tamriel from its doom. the game is set in skyrim the harsh land of the nords in the middle of a civil war and you can choose a side in it; the stormcloaks or the imperals or you can stay neutral and kill both or be peaceful, it is up to you what you do. the game has lived up to all expectations and has surpassed all. in my opinion it is the best game bethesda has ever made. the graphicss are amazing, the gamplay is a big step up from previous elder scrolls games. unlike elder scrolls 4: oblivion, not every voice is the same. there are some that are the same but that is undestandable because they dont have unlimted voice actors. some people hate how it is not as pretty as oblivion but i think this is a good thing because skyrim is a harsh land where it is always snowing so that is why i like this idea. the story is awesome but is not as long as oblivions, in fact it is a lot shorter than oblivion so they could of made it a bit longer but its quality makes up for it. i like how unlike oblivion, its class system, no longer have to choose a class make up your own with skill and skill trees with perks be god if you want to. overall i recommend this game to anyone, it is the best game i have ever played and has surpassed all expectation, its a thumbs up from me, if i had to give it a rating; 9.5/10. its great, if you like what you hear go buy it yourself you wont regret it.",234.1

"as you can see the top comment from rob || n (my role model) who played it for about 2875 hours. consider that if youre into modding then youll probably get half of those hours just finding and trying out the thousands of skyrim mods out there. which makes up about another 1437 hours. add those 2 figures up and youll get 4312 hours. cosidering that the average hours played per day (if you dont have any serious work in your life) then youll probably play about 8 hours. so take 4312 and divide it with 8 hours of gameplay per day itll probably span for about 539 days worth of skyrim. that in theory works in game price per day like so: $29.99 usd (usual retail price) / 539 days = freaking worth every cent for those who cared about the math it is about: $0.0556 usd in short, you should be it whether or not you like modding or not. its the best open world game ever (to me & as of 2013) and best purchase i have ever made, even without the dlcs cuz i couldnt wait for it to get any cheaper when i bought it during the autumn sale 2013. the community for this game is another great thing about the game and if you want to try modding, go look up gopher in youtube, i learnt and every bit of introduction from his videos and still am, kudos to the people in the modding community such as him. ps: im sorry for wasting your time with this review when you couldve spent the 10 mins exploring the vast awesomeness of skyrim that bethesda has created for us.",328.4

"skyrim is probably one of my favorite games. i have played it on the xbox, ps3, and pc, and all i can say is... wow. the game is great ; it has an awesome plot, graphics, and interesting mods. because however, i have played it on different consoles, it is annoying to have to restart, and then proceed to get through all the cutscenes and quests i have completed so many times before. but time and time again, i find myself dealing with the struggle and continuing where i left off previously, and strangely enjoying every minute of it. this game has a few flaws, but if you like rpgs, get this game now! 9.5/10",38.1

"the game is set in the titular snowy realm, its the fifth in the fantasy series that defines the term open world, and its got dragons in it. this game is addictive with its storyline, exploration, quests, factions. the game litterally grips you tight and wont let you go! :p the opening of the fifth elder scrolls game immeditely throws you into conflict, destruction, the civil war storyline and the arrival of a dragon which means potential doom for skyrim. this game is set in the cold, snowy harsh-land of the nords (which is based on norse-men/vikings) and skyrim has a lot more to deal with than only dragons! skyrim is torn between two sides due to the civil war - the imperials and the stormcloaks which both have different interests but seeks to oppose the other side for power. then there is all these other factions who need help such as the companions (whose storyline i really love), the dark brotherhood and the thieves guild to name a few. skyrim has a vast and beautiful landscape with its amazing cities (whiterun, riften, winterhold and solitude are my favourite cities by far) that has its own history, culture and story. with skyrim, youll always have something to do. whether that is questing, fighting, exploring, crafting, stealing - there is so much to do and skyrim gives you tons of choices and options which for me is one of the most important things a game should have. skyrim is a complete free-world so you could do whatever you want and arent limited to just one thing for example you can completely skip out the main storyline about the rise of dragons and as well as that the game has amazing replayablitity. you can replay the games tons of times as different races, classes, stories, modded or vanilla. basically in a nutshell, skyrim is an amazing game where you can truly live the life of a fantasy world. so, for that i give the game a thumbs-up and a 4 out of 5 stars! :d",163.8

"when you hear the word rpg, what is the first thing that comes to mind? elder scrolls, or dungeons and dragons? maybe both? skyrim is an example of what happens when true elements of both rpg & action are put the ultimatum. its an absolutely beautiful game with a game soundtrack to pay money for. with the addition of mods this is in the top 10 list of all time greatest steam games. in the beginning you start off a prisoner in the hands of cyrodills imperial legion led by the region head legatus, general tullius. although you start off on death throw if you will with your head about to be a seperate part of your body entirely the game quickly breaks the idea of an execution by bringing in a sudden dragon assault on the city of helgen which is at the time an imperial outpost connecting the rest of tamriel including parts of the game oblivion to the region of skyrim. there are more quests to even count in this game, i lost count around 60 but the addition of mods can add around another 1,000 quests if not more. which then we come to the crown jewel of many steam games, modding communities and boy.. does skyrim have one, well over 100+ different mods for every reason what so ever. there are mods which fixed the broken military system in the game, there are mods which adds more travelers and adventurers on the road adding more of a lifelike feel to the game. there are also mods which can hurt the games realism as well, some mods are not meant for the lore of elder scrolls but the entertainment of the player instead. if i were to give esv: skyrim a rating, in a range from 1 - 10 its nearly a 9.5, its great on so many levels but there are snibbets even with mods still arent correcting. guards only want you and nobody else. the npcs do the same constant moves 24/7, and for some reason i never understood this an npc whos 10 feet away will stop everything theyre doing to say hi to you. skyrim rating: syndicate rating gameplay - 8 (gameplay is good but could dramatically be improved with more combat actions) rpg element - 10 (this game seemed to never have an ending to the nearly limitless number of quests you could do, on ps3 i spent well over 100 hours playing the game and was just barely getting done. ) multiplayer - 0 (the game isnt meant for online play, and it really doesnt take anything away from the true game itself.) graphics - 9 (graphics on vanilla are good for the game, but with enhancement mods it will skyrocket to a solid 10 with every little detail imaginable.) replay value: 10 (this game is beyond the single word of addicting, it will make you come back for more and more.) official syndicate rating, 9.6 - skyrim is a masterpiece in roleplay engineering a true marvel of bethesda. the amazement is after 3 years this game still runs as strong as ever! revitalized with the modding community skyrim maybe one of the legends of the rpg and maybe even steam game series which lives on.",344.1

"note: my experience may vary from yours since i was running 70+ mods, some of which altered companion ai, voiced dialogue, graphics, etc. this review is directed at players who never played the elder scrolls before and have little experience with fantasy rpgs. skyrim is one of the greatest western rpgs of this generation but im convinced that its not for everyone. if youre not sure if this is the right game for you, then ask yourself the following questions: 1. do you enjoy playing in a fantasy setting similar to lord of the rings that includes magic, orcs, elves, demons, etc. ? 2. do you enjoy lore? that includes paying attention to the dialogue, considering the impact of your choices on the main story and possibly even reading many pages of text? (the last one is optional) 3. do you enjoy exploring dungeons? it involves enemies, simple puzzles and loot that may include gear or ability upgrades. 4. do you enjoy playing a single player experience in a vast open world with only ai to interact with? mmo players often find the game too quiet and lonely. 5. do you enjoy embarking on hundreds of side quests? i know a number of people who were distracted by the side quests and eventually forgot what the main story was about and unfortunately quit. 6. (optional) do you enjoy endless modding possibilities? skyrim has the biggest modding community on the internet and the things you can change range from absurd to epic. please note that excessive modding can make your game very unstable and even render it unplayable if youre not very careful. i spent days preparing a list of cohesive mods then i installed and uninstalled them a number of times and troubleshooted multiple problems to make them work. the process can very tedious but the results are completely worth it. if your answer to all the above questions is yes, then i would recommend that you get skyrim. a number of my friends quit the game within a few days because they got distracted by side quests and forgot the goal of the main story. if youre like them then i recommend that you beat the main campaign first. youll have all the time in the world after that for the various quests, factions and dlcs. bethesdas take on the various playable races and their designs is very different from the likes of lord of the rings and warcraft. do not expect to see skimpy armors or fair elves. the game has a considerable number of bugs. nothing that would ruin your experience but expect the occasional glitch or crash to happen. i recommend saving every often. fallout 3 or nv fan? you will feel right at home. just replace the guns with swords and magic and the post apocalyptic wasteland with a fantasy setting.",85.0

"i could type up a long review for this game and explain how great it is in-detail. but words cant describe such a beautiful game. it released in 2011, and still graphically tops most releases today. and with mods only further improving the aesthetics, its amazing eye candy. the main story is average. but with the tons and tons of side-quests, it comes together for an amazing universe and story with great lore. ive found myself spending a lot of time simply reading the books within the game. the sword combat isnt anything to write home about. its the same as all tes games, though, and sadly isnt on par with oblivions difficulty. but throw in magic and other ways to fight, its still entertaining. the environments are amazing. throwing away the bland and copy-paste dungeons of oblivion, each new location is filled with fun enemies and beautiful views. all in all, skyrim is my most played title and amazing in every right. if you are still thinking about getting skyrim, i recommend you do it asap. with tons of mods to fix the slightest problems you might find or to simply improve your own experience, its a game that hardly ever gets old. i highly recommend you get it.",466.6
"skyrim is one of the best games ever made. the elder scrolls games is my second favorite game series of all time behind the halo series and before the mass effect series. its an amazing immersive game that i get lost into every time i hear that music.",251.3

"this is my favorite rpg game ever. the quests are well designed and fun to do whilst being easy to get started subtract everything you hate about past elder scrolls games, add everything you love, add a better engine that does not crash on you every 10 minutes and is not a steaming pile of bugs, pretty up everything, make the faces cooler and make just about everything better and you have skyrim. this game is a masterpiece, its the game that we have been waiting for in 2011, (most titles this year have been bad to say the least) this game would deserve a perfect 10 if not for the super lame secondary main quest which is the civil war, you can kill the final boss in one hit, i understand that level scaling is bad in most cases, but in some cases things have to be level scaled. the annoying part is, the civil war is about the length of the dragon questline! this game would get a 9.7 in my book now, thanks to that one little detail, but since metacritic forces me to round up my score, 10 it is!",336.1

"so in this game you are the chosen one who has to save the world from the big evil monster using your choice of medieval fantasy weaponry or magic. you also do quests and look at the scenery alot in case there is something worth checking out there. lastly you can get a house to live in and spend the rest of your time crafting potions and not talking to the spouse of your choice that you decided to leave home because they kept getting in your way during combat. hmm. sounds like a billion other games you have played, right? youre sick of this, right? i sure am. now that ive probably succeeded in making fanboys rage and amusing others, ill actually write some stuff that might be worth reading. at its core, its not that different from all the other fantasy games you may have played and never want to see again. except that its in a gigantic open world that you can spend hundreds of hours exploring. that there are multiple side-quests of decent length that in most cases are quite interesting and provide unexpected twists. and that if you ever wanted a game that could quite literally have an endless amount of content, then this may very well be it. also there are mods. lots of them. enough to make this game fresh and to eat even more of your time. ive unlocked all of the achievements and clocked over 300 hours into this, and yet i still feel as if i can still get more out of this game. so yeah, it is exactly what everyone tells you it is: a massive open world rpg that can occupy your free time for weeks and even months before you feel like moving on to something else. you have been warned. now go kill a dragon, marry someone, or kill one of the countless city guards who have taken an arrow in the knee at some point in their lives. enjoy!",303.4
"skyrim is the bethesda game weve been waiting for for years. bethesda finally fixed the horrible performance problems in the engine that have been present for at least 8 years. the graphics have been improved so much that you can actually call the game beautiful. combat is more fun and fluid than ever. this is the first bethesda game ive ever played thats stable. i played from release day and had 2 crashes in 130 hours. even fully patched fallout 3/new vegas with stability mods added cant even go 1/10 of that time without crashing twice. combine that with the most interesting and content-filled world bethesdas ever made, no more cookie-cutter dungeons, dragons, horses that are actually useful, and finally a leveling system that doesnt require grinding useless skills to get stat point bonuses on level up....the list goes on. skyrim just improves on every aspect of the previous games. i know some people still prefer morrowind, and some weird ones think that oblivion is better, skyrim is the king of bethesda games and of open world rpgs.",259.0

"bethesda tends to outdue themselves with every new rendition of the elder scrolls. this time its no different. the vast world of skyrim will suck you in, no matter who you are. there is enough content to qualm anybody who is a naysayer of someone who worries at the thought of a full price purchase. of course, skyrim now goes on sale on an almost regular basis, so essentially you get a deal of a lifetime. why would you pass on that, right? skyrim has a myriad of spells, abilities, items, and just stuff to do in general. there is a great modding community that increases its already lengthy playtime. if you are the type who enjoys content that just... well... never ends then youll enjoy the endless amounts of quests some npcs will grant you. these npcs are generally from the guilds that return to the game - i.e. the dark brotherhood, the mages guild, etc. if you recall from the previous elder scrolls. of course, there are some downsides to the game, as any game does. although the game does provide a vast and huge land, a lot of it just is empty. i enjoy the emptiness considering that adds realism to the game but, many do not like this. the problem more or less comes from the random caves, houses, ruins, that have no relevance to them. again, its something i enjoy, but there is a point to be made that it can appear to be just filler to keep people like myself to keep searching. some old school elder scroll players may be taken aback at the fact that oblivions ability tree is gone, no more acrobatics skill. this isnt a bad thing. its a good thing. honest. what it comes down to is that skyrim has adapted to changes in the way games are tailored nowadays and have removed some of the more grindy things that was associated with its predecessors. all in all, get this game. you will not regret it.",407.7
"well i think we cant say enything new about skyrim. this game is just awesome in alot of ways, the thing i rly like is that u can change views from 3th to 1st person eny time u desire. i recommend this game for enyone who is looking for exitement in an rpg game. u will get pulled from one story to the other all while exploring this vast and wonderfull world (nicely polished) the only small thing i can find is the fact that there is no online-multi co-op option, but then i guess thats where eso will fill in the blanks. 9-10 sound(track) 9-10 storyline 8-10 gameplay-mechanics a big thumbs up.",17.2

"well today is the day, the day i finally reviewed skyrim and my soon to be 300 hours+ of all of the crap i have done in it and all of the stuff i loved about it. i hope i have enough room to type this all out... pros: starting the game: weird title yes but hear me out, when i was starting out i was in a cart with my hands tied with like 3 other people, khajiit or not you b@#%ards have to quit arresting me for something i dont even know about. so i made my female khajiit and went on with whatever the story was, i was about to get decapitated for no reason, the f$#k imperials, then a dragon came out of nowhere, blew fire at people, and everyone ran off, i did what any sane man would do, i got up and ran the heii towards a building with a stormcloak in it, as well as their leader, they told me to jump to the next building and run, then i ran into a imperial and i just kind of glared like ugh i am gonna kill you whenever i get out of these ropes. he just told me to follow him to stay alive. i will say this i felt helpless considering i didnt have any means to fight, not even a sword, after i followed the imperial i had a choice between going with the stormcloak guy on the back of the cart or the imperial, whichever person went with the imperial is a idget and doesnt deserve this game. so after the constant running around under tunnels and killing imperials we finally got out and i was free to explore. you are the dragonborn! (of course you are): surprise surprise you are the one guy/girl out of the hundreds of people who has some special talent, obvious plot is obvious, you can absorb dragon souls, and learn new shouts so you can do some amazing powers, but of course the stupid fus-ro-dah thing gets overused to high heii, that meme can suck my a$$. shouts: since you are the dragonborn, you can absorb souls of dragons, learn words of the dragons so you can do shouts, etc. there is a lot of shouts to find and use, my favorite one is marked for death, basically when your shout touches them they lose health slowly and i think are a little more substainable to attacks since when i was fighting a dragur leader i was barely knocking off health, i used a 3 word shout for marked for death and i could knock off a good bit from him instead of just little bits at a time. somewhat big world: when i saw the map size i thought it was a bit small but large at the same time, but after the hours of exploration i had done i realized they packed a lot of stuff in to one small like area. weapons and armor: you get a good variety of weapons and armor, you can even manage them, not that stupid oblivion crap where you have to make sure they dont break, no, i mean you can make them even stronger, so they do more damage, same goes for armor yet its even more durable and you take less damage. random encounters in the world: while i was running around aimlessly for hours i ran into several people, a guy selling skooma/moonsugar, as much as khajiit love moonsugar i said no, he got all uppity, and we fought and i won. a thief who tried to take my stuff and i beat the crap out of him. and random people asking for help in general. there is so much stuff to do in this small world its so weird at times but it does keep the whole wandering thing very well since instead of just walking from place to place being bored, you now walk place to place expecting somethign to happen. constant exploration = constant stuff happening: what i mean by the title is that while you are running around even if you go to the same place a few times something different might happen, whether it be on the way there, or maybe when you get there, cause the world basically changes while you play and even die. a crapton of quests: there is a s@%t ton of quests to do, and so many places to go and so many things you have to do just to complete one quest alone, its just so weird to have so much stuff to do, it can get a little overwhelming at times though. tough enemies: even on normal when i was running around i ran into some really tough enemies, well untill i got legendary daedric armor and legendary dragonbone weapons, then i amped the difficulty up abit and realized i was in over my head till i got to higher levels, ill just say this right now, mages in this game are overpowered like crazy, i was playing on legendary difficulty and got into some tough fights but i always came up out of them, mages? 3 hits with lightning and i dropped, you f%@kin kidding me? mods up the ying yang: theres mods for everything on this game, i got about 150 hours without mods and just high res dlc packs, then i got a few mods, i got a majoras mask (actual mask) for my khajiit girl, then a majoras mask moon in the sky, then a zelda audio conversion mod which got a lot of music from oot, majoras mask, wind waker, twilight princess, and skyward sword, with battle themes too. theres enhanced blood so blood actually goes on the ground, as well as make blood pools, characters get bloody from fighting. a wet & cold mod that changes a few things around, like people that talk (as well as yourself) in cold climates when they exhale air you can see it form infront of you, as well as wear fur coats in cold climates, when you get out of water, water will actually drop from your suit, and in rain youll be covered in water, in snowy climates your armor will actually get snow on it while its snowing, forming a little blanket, and many many more. now i have about 280 hours. this is why pc is better, on ps3 and 360 you would have to waste a s%#t ton of time modding it and on pc for steam you just have to click a subscribe button in the workshop and you are done, no bulls%@t in between. cons: poisons: these are in the game yes but i never even used them, they were just kind of there i took a few with me incase i did need them but i never even touched them after a while. weight limit: this is more of a nit pick than anything else, but everything weighs a ton, especially when you start hoarding dragon bones and dragon scales off of dragons, so i just console commanded myself a weight limit so i wouldnt have to deal with it anymore. mages: mages are again, over powered, like the one i explained above, 3 lightning strikes and i fell over, are you kidding me? thats horses$#t, it should have taken much more than that since i have legendary armor on with dual enchantments on each item and weapon, i should be set. shouts/shout time delay: some shouts feel uterly useless, and even their time delay is a pain, dragur who can shout do it every few seconds and yet i have to wait a few minutes, why? thats stupid, ai shouldnt get the upperhand the player should. no mission markers: at times like with the stones of brazahain or whatever its called, you get no mission markers showing where they are, so you have to find them all, i dont mind looking around for stuff but if i dont have a good implecation on where its actually at its going to get really annoying, thankfully there is a mod that gives it mission markers so you can run around and grab them without having to go through place to place looking for them. armor and weapons: a good chunk of weapons are utterly useless and never really touched, yes if you find a weapon that is stronger, obviously you would use it, but weak weapons like daggers and crap i never ever touch. as for armor if you are thinking dragon bone armor and weapons are the best you are wrong and i shall explain, i wasted time getting both daedric weapons and armor, as well as dragon bone weapons and armor, i legendaried all of them and compared, daedric armor is better than dragon bone armor, and dragon bone weapons are stronger than daedric weapons, i dont know why but they are. dieing/encounters: this kind of sucks, when you die you go to your last save, so if you went on for a hour and died without saving you have to do it all over, again.",308.0

"this is my review which lists the pros and cons of, the elder scrolls v: skyrim, for the pc. ive beaten this game three times outside of steam, and i dont just mean the main quest... ill mainly try to review the modless version of the game, but i really will try to emphasise how mods can enhance the game and every aspect of it. ill try to be as descriptive and helpful as i can, while still maintaining that checklist flow. this should sum up just about everything that needs to be said in one review. if anyone has any pros/cons they think i should add, go ahead and tell me in the comments and ill adjust the material accordingly. some of these on the list will only be recognizeable by fans of the previous elder scrolls games, but theyll be subtle. here goes... *pros? +the amazing open world of skyrim to explore +decent and immersive story to follow for each questline +graphics look simply amazing, theyre not too extensive on the hardware, and there are plenty of mods to enhance them +fast travel is an available option once you discover a location, and there are countless locations to discover +epic soundtrack composed by the well known jeremy soule to enjoy +countless of npcs to interact with +unlike morrowind, this game has more than a single digit of voice actors, haha +plenty of followers/companions to follow you on your adventures +tons of factions to join +countless of quests, sidequests, and misc. quests for you to do +your actions, choices, faction activies, progress, etc. all have an impact on skyrim, its people, and you +a crime and effect/bounty system +ability to interact with the daedra princes +a massive amount of items available in-game +a massive amount of different creatures and enemies for you to fight, and plenty of boss fights available +plenty of playstyles to choose from (e.g. warrior, thief, mage, craftsman, etc.) +the ability to become a vampire or werewolf, which is very well done (both have their own skill trees) +tons of skills to level and expand on, there are branching skill tree perks (theyve added aspects to the skill tree that can expand the max level to 252+, instead of the original 81) +a difficulty slider for 5 different difficulties- can be changed any time in-game +amazing character creation (e.g. name, gender, race, hair, eyes, skin tone, paint/dirt, facial construction, etc.), and there are even mods to expand your options +houses, wife, kids, and pets (hearthfire dlc adds extra huge houses that you can build up yourself) +console codes are an option. you can go ahead and cheat, or if youre stuck in a glitch or a bug you can go ahead and try to fix it with the console which is very useful. the console does not deactivate achievements like in fallout: new vegas +the dlc expansions are amazing, and are totally worth the price; and youll clock in tons of enjoyment and hours to the game, which is why i recommend the legendary edition to begin with (dragonborn dlc adds solstheim to the map- which past fans will remember from the bloodmoon dlc from morrowind) +free hd texture pack dlc available for download, which is completely optional +mods, mods, mods!!! there are countless of mods out there for you to enjoy, literally. they are easy to install. and, they can change the whole of the game completely. i cant even begin to capitalize on this pro. they can change everything +steam worshop integration, and nexus mod manager support +still a huge community +steam badges, trading cards, backgrounds, emoticons, and achievements (and steam sync is integrated) +fully mappable controls +my opinion? morrowind > skyrim > oblivion, although newer gamers may not be able to enjoy morrowind, so skyrim may be the way to go for you +no cliff-racers *cons? -not as good without mods- but still amazing nonetheless, mods are completely optional. this may be more of a con for console players i guess -mods can sometimes cause ctds (crash to desktop), corrupt saves, bugs, glitches, etc. -bugs, glitches, and crashes -some morrowind fanboys hate on the game- so you might be reading this and end up being one of them (before you say anything; morrowind is one of my favorite games of all time, and i can admit that i like it way better than skyrim) -main questline is a bit short -repeated npc lines can get a bit annoying- there are mods to fix that though -horses seem to be a bit slow and weak- there are mods to fix that though -becoming a vampire seems to have more cons than pros in my opinion- there are mods to fix that though -can become a bit op later in the game, if so, turning up the difficulty should help a bit (might be a good thing or a bad thing) -a bit lacking in graphical/display settings- but its not that taxing, and it does offer plenty of settings in the launcher -dragons eventually become the new cliff-racer- there are mods to fix that though well, that was my review of skyrim. i hope i convinced you to purchase this game. or maybe i convinced you not to purchase this game, you never know. anyways, thanks for reading, and i hope i was helpful in your decision. or, maybe i just convinced you to go ahead and get into mods, hah",83.1

3 hits with lightning and i dropped, you f%@kin kidding me? mods up the ying yang: theres mods for everything on this game, i got about 150 hours without mods and just high res dlc packs, then i got a few mods, i got a majoras mask (actual mask) for my khajiit girl, then a majoras mask moon in the sky, then a zelda audio conversion mod which got a lot of music from oot, majoras mask, wind waker, twilight princess, and skyward sword, with battle themes too. theres enhanced blood so blood actually goes on the ground, as well as make blood pools, characters get bloody from fighting. a wet & cold mod that changes a few things around, like people that talk (as well as yourself) in cold climates when they exhale air you can see it form infront of you, as well as wear fur coats in cold climates, when you get out of water, water will actually drop from your suit, and in rain youll be covered in water, in snowy climates your armor will actually get snow on it while its snowing, forming a little blanket, and many many more. now i have about 280 hours. this is why pc is better, on ps3 and 360 you would have to waste a s%#t ton of time modding it and on pc for steam you just have to click a subscribe button in the workshop and you are done, no bulls%@t in between. cons: poisons: these are in the game yes but i never even used them, they were just kind of there i took a few with me incase i did need them but i never even touched them after a while. weight limit: this is more of a nit pick than anything else, but everything weighs a ton, especially when you start hoarding dragon bones and dragon scales off of dragons, so i just console commanded myself a weight limit so i wouldnt have to deal with it anymore. mages: mages are again, over powered, like the one i explained above, 3 lightning strikes and i fell over, are you kidding me? thats horses$#t, it should have taken much more than that since i have legendary armor on with dual enchantments on each item and weapon, i should be set. shouts/shout time delay: some shouts feel uterly useless, and even their time delay is a pain, dragur who can shout do it every few seconds and yet i have to wait a few minutes, why? thats stupid, ai shouldnt get the upperhand the player should. no mission markers: at times like with the stones of brazahain or whatever its called, you get no mission markers showing where they are, so you have to find them all, i dont mind looking around for stuff but if i dont have a good implecation on where its actually at its going to get really annoying, thankfully there is a mod that gives it mission markers so you can run around and grab them without having to go through place to place looking for them. armor and weapons: a good chunk of weapons are utterly useless and never really touched, yes if you find a weapon that is stronger, obviously you would use it, but weak weapons like daggers and crap i never ever touch. as for armor if you are thinking dragon bone armor and weapons are the best you are wrong and i shall explain, i wasted time getting both daedric weapons and armor, as well as dragon bone weapons and armor, i legendaried all of them and compared, daedric armor is better than dragon bone armor, and dragon bone weapons are stronger than daedric weapons, i dont know why but they are. dieing/encounters: this kind of sucks, when you die you go to your last save, so if you went on for a hour and died without saving you have to do it all over, again.",308.0

"this game is absolutely amazing. i must say that the programing gods at bethesda have really outdone themselves. skyrim offers a free roam world full of quests, secrets, and hidden tresures that litter the stunningly beautiful, midevil landscape. i would recommend this game to any gamer whether they prefer call of duty styled first person shooters, or world of warcraft styled rpgs. it also offers a number of dlc packs that will carry your adventure through the elder scrolls series even further! if you ever get bored of the run-of-the-mill questing crap you can always look towards the steam workshop for over 19,000 different gameplay enhancing mods. this work of art will always keep you on your toes, so keep yourself awake every night playing until your eyes are dryer than the sahara desert!",35.4
"okay....so this is a game where you will never want to quit playing. it has main story lines/quests........but then it has side quests, and they are not like most other games. these sometimes take up to as long as the main quest, that is what i love i could sit down and play all day long if i could. if i had a life i would throw it away to play this game, but i can not do that because i already did. i would fap to this game like it was porn. i would marry this game. i would die with this game, and tell them to put it in the grave with me. it just makes me sooo happy to see it when im down i put in the disc start it up and drown in the, eminse.....fictional world of skyrim...as the dragonborn. the dragons are my mentors... the priests and the greybeards...the dragons are my friends not my enemies.......i love this ing game do not make more this is just uhh....perfect. the reason i have barely have any hours is because i currently have a  pc...so i play on my dads pc when i can, but im getting a new one soon. 1,000,000/10 buy it now!!!!",38.8
"this is my review for this 2 year old game. to start off dont be fooled by the only 5 hours logged on stewam. i first played around 300 hours on a non steam version of the game and picked it up again in sale. now off to the game. now where to start? the story: the stoy is little short but still great to play trhough, good voice actors, enjoyable story and when your done with the main story there are plenty of thing to do around like just freakin murdering everyone or blowing lydia of high hrotgar with fus ro dah :d or just do what you want. write your own story. the gameplay: if you like to play in first or third person your choice i like the third person view myself since you can see more of the beautiful world of skyrim around you. the cmbat is solid. not super hard or something but still pretty good. so many weapons in this game just choose what you want. the graphics: its okay i guess. not the best ive seen but hey its a 2 year old game. and oh yeah some textures are just terrible. but thanks to the awesome skyrim community there are some great texturepacks out there that make the game look so much better. and speaking of the community. its still huge after 2 years. its awesome. there are so many mods for this game that add to a great gameplay experience. go check out the nexus site for mods and the steam workshop ofcourse well to wrap this review up: i sunk in well over 300 hours and im not even bored yet. the open world is so huge and its worth exploring. for me personaly pretty much one of the best games ive ever played. deserves a good and deserved 10/10 buy it already. bye",13.7

"its a bethesda game so of course even years after release it still has a few bugs hiding around in its crevices. the combat is playable and the stealth system is in no way balenced. the game has alot to do in plenty of places but never alot to do in one place. it is an oceans worth of content but at no point in that ocean is there any depth excluding the main quest line and the dragonborn dlc. the game just feels rushed. the standard guilds that are in every elder scrolls game are fairly lackluster with few of them even making you feel involved in the group. the entire mages guild questiline would have been 2 missions worth of mages guild in oblivion. the civil war barely has an effect on the game, you can beome thane of all skyrim by moving goods from point a to point b, the most humerous part of the game are the guards who all apparently hail sithis. the crafting system, fluidity of combat, and mods are what saves this game. crafting is quite honestly fun, if it wasnt for the new and better leveling system i would put all my skill points into it with no regard for my own life. if bethesda had delivered on the econonomy system they promised us than maybe i would be able to without dying to the wolves in between riverwood and whiterun. i enjoy traveling to mines, slaughtering the residents, and then stealing the ores to forge more weapons and armor to help me do it all over again. mods fix many of the problems with the game from graphics to ai bugs to the lack of a good storyline for guilds. honestly i am going to say that vannila skyrim gets a different rating than modded skyrim since modded the game is just so vastly different. vannila: 7.6/10 modded: 9.2/10",88.1

"so in this game you are the chosen one who has to save the world from the big evil monster using your choice of medieval fantasy weaponry or magic. you also do quests and look at the scenery alot in case there is something worth checking out there. lastly you can get a house to live in and spend the rest of your time crafting potions and not talking to the spouse of your choice that you decided to leave home because they kept getting in your way during combat. hmm. sounds like a billion other games you have played, right? youre sick of this, right? i sure am. now that ive probably succeeded in making fanboys rage and amusing others, ill actually write some stuff that might be worth reading. at its core, its not that different from all the other fantasy games you may have played and never want to see again. except that its in a gigantic open world that you can spend hundreds of hours exploring. that there are multiple side-quests of decent length that in most cases are quite interesting and provide unexpected twists. and that if you ever wanted a game that could quite literally have an endless amount of content, then this may very well be it. also there are mods. lots of them. enough to make this game fresh and to eat even more of your time. ive unlocked all of the achievements and clocked over 300 hours into this, and yet i still feel as if i can still get more out of this game. so yeah, it is exactly what everyone tells you it is: a massive open world rpg that can occupy your free time for weeks and even months before you feel like moving on to something else. you have been warned. now go kill a dragon, marry someone, or kill one of the countless city guards who have taken an arrow in the knee at some point in their lives. enjoy!",303.4

"note: my experience may vary from yours since i was running 70+ mods, some of which altered companion ai, voiced dialogue, graphics, etc. this review is directed at players who never played the elder scrolls before and have little experience with fantasy rpgs. skyrim is one of the greatest western rpgs of this generation but im convinced that its not for everyone. if youre not sure if this is the right game for you, then ask yourself the following questions: 1. do you enjoy playing in a fantasy setting similar to lord of the rings that includes magic, orcs, elves, demons, etc. ? 2. do you enjoy lore? that includes paying attention to the dialogue, considering the impact of your choices on the main story and possibly even reading many pages of text? (the last one is optional) 3. do you enjoy exploring dungeons? it involves enemies, simple puzzles and loot that may include gear or ability upgrades. 4. do you enjoy playing a single player experience in a vast open world with only ai to interact with? mmo players often find the game too quiet and lonely. 5. do you enjoy embarking on hundreds of side quests? i know a number of people who were distracted by the side quests and eventually forgot what the main story was about and unfortunately quit. 6. (optional) do you enjoy endless modding possibilities? skyrim has the biggest modding community on the internet and the things you can change range from absurd to epic. please note that excessive modding can make your game very unstable and even render it unplayable if youre not very careful. i spent days preparing a list of cohesive mods then i installed and uninstalled them a number of times and troubleshooted multiple problems to make them work. the process can very tedious but the results are completely worth it. if your answer to all the above questions is yes, then i would recommend that you get skyrim. a number of my friends quit the game within a few days because they got distracted by side quests and forgot the goal of the main story. if youre like them then i recommend that you beat the main campaign first. youll have all the time in the world after that for the various quests, factions and dlcs. bethesdas take on the various playable races and their designs is very different from the likes of lord of the rings and warcraft. do not expect to see skimpy armors or fair elves. the game has a considerable number of bugs. nothing that would ruin your experience but expect the occasional glitch or crash to happen. i recommend saving every often. fallout 3 or nv fan? you will feel right at home. just replace the guns with swords and magic and the post apocalyptic wasteland with a fantasy setting.",85.0

"in skyrim you may find yourself in a huge open world where you can choose which path of many youll take, and, if you put enough effort, why not all of them? you have a really good main questline that is surrounded by even better questlines, like the epic thieves guild and dark brotherhood quests. you will have over two hundred hours of game before youre able to say ive got no more quests to do. if youve finished your main questline, slayed alduin and saved the world, you can still go after the dragon claws, dragon shouts, dragon priests masks(you probably notice theyve got all about dragons this time right?), becoming the leader of the mages college of winterhold, thieves guild, companions, dark brotherhood, becoming a general on a civil war, collecting all the daedric artifacts(which one has its unique quest), joining the bards guild, and even doing tons of sidequests, and do all of this with a character that most suits your style of playing, it can be a mage, battle mage, warrior, berserker, paladin, stealth assassin, rogue, summoner... and im not even talking about the dlcs that come with new questlines and a whole new continent for you to explore. as if this was not enough, the game counts with a incredible number of totally functional mods that can add more quests, more races, more weapons and armors, take the graphs to a whole new level, make the game mor immersive, give you a new user interface, completely change the whole game that even make you feel like you dont know how to play skyrim anymore(t3nd0, im talking to you), and all kinds of mods you can think about(dont use it too much or you may end up like a teenage mutant ninja turtle slaying trains on mario land). thats it, if you like action rpg with a lot of stories for you to be part of theres no way youre not liking skyrim.",206.3

"skyrim is like pringles. a more serious review: the elder scrolls skyrim is without a doubt, one of the very few games that hooked me on for hours. very few games achieved that. ive played many games that as much as i loved and enjoyed playing, they couldnt suck me in this black hole where i just cant stop. skyrim is like pringles, say you only want one chip, then you want another, and another, in the end you finished the entire can before you know it. as a game, skyrims endless number of quests, side stories, npcs, items, dungeons, random overworld events mean you never run out of things to do, which also means you can never really stop until you tell yourself ive totally played this for way too long. skyrim is a first person rpg, a standard not many rpgs follow. nearly every one ive played is third person or real time, but the first person style makes skyrim that much more engaging, with combat very skill oriented. you have stats, but it is simplified to only health, stamina and magic, meaning theres no need to fiddle around with crazy amounts of numbers to figure out what are the best equipment. some may disagree and prefer having more stat variety, i say the simplicity means you spend less time looking at your inventory and more time fighting, which is where the fun is. unlike most other rpgs, if you missed, its because you missed. everything based on your skill of aiming. similarly, if you failed to block, you didnt block in time. all of this makes skyrim the most action oriented rpg game ive played, something which i find really fun. fighting is all part of your own skill whilst other rpgs are basically down to just picking the right skills and hoping the rng will make the enemies miss or for you to land more critical hits. tesv: skyrim is a black hole. it is pringles. it is the game that few games achieved to do to me. suck me in and not let go. for comparison, the other games that did this were: pokemon red, the sims and metroid prime. i give tesv: skyrim a pringles/10",210.8

(not online, thats daylight robbery)",1223.5
"this is possibly the best elder scrolls game ever. it has improved or added features from other games. i would know. in the direct predecessor, oblivion you can do many things such as join guilds and organizations like the dark brotherhood, the thieves guild or the blades. in skyrim there are changes, such as the fighters guild in skyrim is called the companions, i know these arent the same groups but they do the same things. and the mages guild is the college of winterhold. there are also very nice dlcs for this game such as the dawnguard or dragonborn dlcs. the dawnguard dlc adds the ability to become a vampire lord as well as perks for the vampire lord and werewolf. it also adds a questline where you have to fight the vampire menace by killing one of the most powerful vampire lords in tamriel, you do this by getting a magic bow to stop the vampires from getting rid of the sun. you also have the choice to join the vampires and block the sun temporarily so that you dont get negative effect from it. that sums dawnguard up. now lets get on to dragonborn. in the dragonborn dlc you get many new things such as shouts, armor, weapons, there is also another new quest line. in this one you fight miraak, the first dragonborn. you go to the island of solstheim to find out why cultist tried to kill you and you run into some trouble along the way. you have to learn the shouts that made miraak so powerful. it is mainly one shout, called bend will. with this shout you have the power of flying dragons. cool huh? you have to go to the daedric lord hermaeus mora to learn this shout. you also meet the skalls, a people consisting of nords that believe in a god called the all-maker. that sums that one up. the is a minor dlc called hearthfire that adds the ability to adopt children and build your own house but that is mainly it. the modding community also are a very important part in this game. they make many fixes to the main game and also enhances it. there has been many mods that patch parts of the game that make it 100 times better. that sums skyrim up. if i was giving this a number rating then i would give it a 9.7 out of 10.",330.3
"i purchased and started this game after at least 7 yrs of playing morrowind. the world (tamriel) is a place i fell in love with due to its intricacies and flora and fauna (tho the fauna does like to try and eat you from time to time). the storyline in skyrim is attentive to the world view that all the elder scroll games seem to follow and that makes it a very enjoyable trip. admittedly, i have made use of one or two mods with the game (glowing books, better crafting, more salt, and a couple of house mods for breezehome, lakeview and the one up north outside of solitude...in hjaalmarch) but am generally running the storyline and as many sidequests as i can. as you can see, to this point i have invested 194+ hours into it and it still keeps me entertained. i have enjoyed the scaling of combat to my level, keeping me challenged. some of the npc voice sets and even graphics tend to get used over and over, but to draw and voice that many individuals would have required a full on hollywood budget to make this game. i love how the story leads you around the world, but doesnt limit your choices while exploring. the side quests really make this an explorers nirvana, and yet still offers more than enough combat for even the most battle loving gamer. for any players (both old school and newer folk) who enjoy a great solo adventure, and one that can really immerse you into the story, this is yet another smash hit for bethesda. welcome to tamriel, grab a sword and follow me. . . .",232.4
"this game is exciting with battles, quest for the gamers who enjoy the excitment and thrills. but since you can add mods, you can make your game look even more realistic. maybe if you want to joke around a little, you can mak it look funny with weapons, characters, npcs, and quests. personally from my expreiance, of course. i think its a fun exciting game for me, and maybe even yourself! i hope you get the game and like it but if you dont thats fine im sure theres many games out there, but this is just one game that you just cant pass out by have fun and enjoy! - ari the travelers guidence star.",432.7

"skyrim is at the time of this review the latest installment of the elder scrolls series. skyrim is a simplified version of the eariler elder scrolls games meant to tend to a casual crowd rather than the hardcore players that loved the elder scrolls iii: morrowind. the addition of the steam workshop really benefited this game with its easy way of adding in extra content created by the fanbase that is sometimes even of higher quality than the dlc packs that were release for the game. overall, this game has its ups and downs but it is a solid game that i have loved ever since it was released. get this.",284.7
"you know these like games. once in lifetime. there are not many games as great as skyrim. for my opinion one of the best games ever will be made. the story is a bit seen though but because great skyrim is famous for its mods the story will be more interesting after a few mods installed. graphics are just great. actually they keep me speechless mostly. and of course bugs, they are the balancing thing between the bloody combat, magic, sthealthiness and travelling. they make this game interesting. i mean that players sometimes even seem to look for the bugs. but as i said in the start once in lifetime. great game. with 0(worst) - 10(best) i would give 9",493.6
"an amazing game, can only get bored when youre stuck in dungeons, make sure you learned clairvoyance! pros: -many factions you can join -great main storyline -great side quests storylines -amazing graphics -a lot of weapons you can choose from -a lot of magic spells you can learn -mod-friendly -just... everything cons: -some of the voices are annoying as  -when changing tabs, double cursor happens (fixed using onetweak mod) 95/100 from me.",108.6
"skyrim starts out with a short intro that is not a video you sit back and watch, but you can immediately look at people and at the environment. your character creation is not before the game, but during the intro implemented well in the storyline, whereupon you get a choice to join either side of the war as opposed to forcing you in one direction as a lot of games do. gameplay contains seemingly infinite quests and different storylines. quests seem hardly repetitive, for even when there are several quests of clearing out caves, every cave is different and interesting. you can explore an enormous world and collect countless objects and powers. gameplay can be estimated on about 200 hours to complete every game and dungeon, if not more. even with the game so immense, interesting and well thought-through, you can download countless mods on skyrim nexus that can increase gameplay by many more hours as well as fix the bugs this gigantic game has and increase performance as well as resolution. there are mods to change appearances of characters, and there are mods that add features such as homes, characters, followers, set-up. even whole new lands can be added with mods to increase the gameplay even more. the only downside i can think of myself is that the game has some bugs. simply go to skyrim nexus and download a bugfix and its done. skyrim is highly recommended for everyone who likes adventuring, exploring, collecting, active combat, interesting storylines and upgrading. if you love skyrim, you may want to give risen and the witcher 2 a try. these games are different, but felt as interesting, even though skyrim is a lot bigger and has more features.",214.5
"i have put in exactly 392 hours into this game since i first purchased it. despite some relatively simple ai, somewhat outdated graphics, a really irritated inventory menu and the inevitable bugs that plague the game, skyrim is one of the greatest rpgs of its era. though simpler than the previous titles of morrowind and oblivion, it allows you much more freedom than either of the two. you can build your character around your particular playstyle with no real optimal builds, and if you ever decide you dislike the way your character is set up, you can simply start training another skill and become good at it. if you spend enough time in tamriel slaying dragons and saving damsels in distress, your character can learn and master all of the different skills that are available to you. the open-world environment and hundreds of places to explore and quests to complete, you never really feel like youre being forced to go down one particular path and every time you play, youll end up discovering something new. the indepth lore surrounding the elder scrolls series heavily immerses you in the world and story, making you feel like youve stepped into another world. if you love rpgs, this is a must have.",469.8

"okay....so this is a game where you will never want to quit playing. it has main story lines/quests........but then it has side quests, and they are not like most other games. these sometimes take up to as long as the main quest, that is what i love i could sit down and play all day long if i could. if i had a life i would throw it away to play this game, but i can not do that because i already did. i would fap to this game like it was porn. i would marry this game. i would die with this game, and tell them to put it in the grave with me. it just makes me sooo happy to see it when im down i put in the disc start it up and drown in the, eminse.....fictional world of skyrim...as the dragonborn. the dragons are my mentors... the priests and the greybeards...the dragons are my friends not my enemies.......i love this ing game do not make more this is just uhh....perfect. the reason i have barely have any hours is because i currently have a  pc...so i play on my dads pc when i can, but im getting a new one soon. 1,000,000/10 buy it now!!!!",38.8
"this is my review for this 2 year old game. to start off dont be fooled by the only 5 hours logged on stewam. i first played around 300 hours on a non steam version of the game and picked it up again in sale. now off to the game. now where to start? the story: the stoy is little short but still great to play trhough, good voice actors, enjoyable story and when your done with the main story there are plenty of thing to do around like just freakin murdering everyone or blowing lydia of high hrotgar with fus ro dah :d or just do what you want. write your own story. the gameplay: if you like to play in first or third person your choice i like the third person view myself since you can see more of the beautiful world of skyrim around you. the cmbat is solid. not super hard or something but still pretty good. so many weapons in this game just choose what you want. the graphics: its okay i guess. not the best ive seen but hey its a 2 year old game. and oh yeah some textures are just terrible. but thanks to the awesome skyrim community there are some great texturepacks out there that make the game look so much better. and speaking of the community. its still huge after 2 years. its awesome. there are so many mods for this game that add to a great gameplay experience. go check out the nexus site for mods and the steam workshop ofcourse well to wrap this review up: i sunk in well over 300 hours and im not even bored yet. the open world is so huge and its worth exploring. for me personaly pretty much one of the best games ive ever played. deserves a good and deserved 10/10 buy it already. bye",13.7

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is the fifth edition of the popular series of role-playing game. this time the story revolves around the return to the land of the ancient race of dragons and assign us to play the role of one of the last dragon hunters. the game starts with the creation of our virtual hero. you can choose from ten diverse races, whereas there is no division into classes. with advances in play, our character becomes more powerful. when you go to the next level, you can independently increase one of the three basic characteristics: magic, strength and health. skill system has been divided into clear groups, for example: one-handed weapons or two-handed. each of these categories contains specific abilities and attacks. there is a new combat system that is more dynamic and also requires tactical thinking. each hand hero can now assign a weapon, shield or spell. skyrim offers the opportunity to explore a huge virtual world, which contains, five major cities and hundreds of the underworld. in order to facilitate getting around such a large area the authors have introduced the option of traveling between locations. we can also modify our game through various add-ons created by the community. to summarize the game has quite an interesting story, it is well optimized, has a very good soundtrack and a huge world to explore. during the game, i spent many wonderful hours exploring the provinces of skyrim. my final rating is 9/10.",174.3

"first off, its a great game, it would be stupid to deny it, but if youve had some issues with morrowind and oblivion (and even fallout 3), they havent been fixed. the animations are still awkward, the combat ai is stiil fight or flee, without any variation or tactics needed. i dont care about the main story as its a sandbox, but the dialog is abysmal. the balance later in the game crawls into a hole and dies, making the game quite dull the farther you get. and as with any bethesda title, there are bugs everywhere. but its still fun to play and when the community starts churning out mods, its gonna be amazing. as someone who hated oblivion before it was cool to hate it, i say i had fun with skyrim. get it when its on sale.",130.3

"short review: 50 hours and more of pure fun. if you enjoyed oblivion or witcher series, you should definitely try this one. good points: * good enough main story and insteresting subquests * aswesome graphics and landscapes * skill trees and combat * huge world * best elder scroll so far. * open worldness (you feel quite free) bad points * can easily become too easy if you abuse the game (unbalanced) * can lose interest if leave the main story. * repetition. (ex: killing the first dragon is cool but afterward it becomes too easy and boring chasing them)",109.8

"i personally would recommend this game to everyone who lands on this page. skyrim was initially the first game i played in the elder scrolls series, despite not having any experience in any of the other elder scrolls games, i was still able to experience the excitement that the lore has to offer. i have spent countless hours (on console) exploring the vast and open landscape that skyrim has to offer, and as i began to feel as though i have done all i could i then bought the dlcs and boy did that extend the playtime a whole lot, i remember when i bought my first plot of land and built my first house with the hearthfire dlc it was heljarchen hall i made the house with a mage/alchemists touch, i felt as though i had accomplished something again.dragonborn was the most epic experience ive ever had from additional content. the vast lands of solstheim added another 200 hours to my playtime (xbox) and i achieved countless hours of epic battle and excitement, exploration on the island led to me discovering more and more quests that kept throwing more fun at me.now for the dawnguard dlc, well dawnguard is a good dlc, the thing i enjoyed most about it though was having serana as my companion. the crossbows were also a really nice addition, they added a new way to play skyrim. when i had completed all of the game having only the repetitive side quests left i decided to start over again and experience the game all over again it was different. personally id like to say that there are so many paths you can take, so many ways you can play this game and so many different adventures you can go on in this game but its your choice to keep pushing on.",137.5
"the only true perfect open world game i have ever come across. 1. smart npcs 2. fully open world 3. complete freedom to play how you want 4. never really ending you can always find something new 5. look up mods on the steam workshop once you put 100 or so hours into the game without mods. there is nothing negative about this game! i would buy this game if it was $200.00 i really hope they re-master some of the older elder scrolls sometime.",266.4

"the storyline of elder scrolls v if you choose to follow it, is well written and well told for fantasy rpg. dragons which the nords had thought to be extinct are terrorizing the tamriel province of skyrim once again! and its up to you and your unique powers to find out why. of course there are plenty of other storylines and roles to play within skyrim; you can choose to live as thief, an assassin, a knight, aspiring mage or you can be all of those things at the same time. you can completely ignore the storyline, find the horse and explore the world and face its dangers at your own pace. the elder scrolls iv: oblivion launched on march 2006, which was very early in the xbox 360s lifecycle. skyrim launches on november 2011, which was consoles generations twilight years. it is impressive to see graphical leaps that had been made. the scope of the map, the detail of the terrain, the intricacies of the characters and the monster models and defined craftsmanship that went into every sword, shield, spell and piece of armor is astounding! a lot of love and care clearly when making into this game. however, no game is perfect and skyrim holds true to that. one of the few complains i have about the game, is that some of the textures are strangely low resolution and they pop-out of the player were they are present. which is sad because it temporarily pulls you out off the game. in terms of gameplay, this is the most streamline elder scrolls game today. i use the term delicately since streamline is often synonymous with dumb down when describing videogames. that is not the case in skyrim. well a good number of spells has seen the axe, everything else has gotten an overhaul it needed. the dual wielding system is fantastic for combat. you can now hold two weapons, two different spells or weapon and the spell in each hand. the combat itself is very satisfying is because they added a finishing moves that are sure-to-please. sneaking is always an option for the stealthy at hard difficulties. skyrim has done away with repair hammers, but in their place they implemented forging skill which is by in far a superior system. enchanting has seen some tweaks as well. but all in all both are great diversions for the average dragon hunter. the music is phenomenal, the voice acting is head and shoulders above the rest of the elder scrolls series. i am very happy to see and hear some familiar faces and voices. battling your first dragon is an adrenaline rush that you havent felt long time in gaming. elders scrolls v: skyrim isnt just videogame, its my vacation dream come true! but its not all the gorgeous vistas and claustrophobic spelunking. the introduction sequence barely does the game any justice. in fact, is a little drawn out tediously. in order to create a new character, youll need to go thru it every single time. you arent simply drop into a world like you are in morrowind. despite of the presence of the dragons chasing you, its not nearly as exciting as oblivions introduction. heres hoping that there is a patch will be put out allowing you to customize your character again before you leave the final cave. so you can create a save file just before that moment and affectively skip the introduction. considering this feature was present in oblivion and fallout games, it is curious that is missing. the menu system is abysmal, especially on the pc. oblivions menu system was a bit overly chaotic and hard to manage but this is somehow worse. in time, you overcome this obstacle but it would be great it was hindrance in the first place. if you are going to pick up skyrim and i absolutely recommend you do. i haul hardly push you getting a pc version. there are already a large handful of fantastic mods available to customize your skyrim experience. skyrim should truly be experience by everyone, even you dont think you are fan of fantasy rpgs. this open world has too much to discover. skyrim is easily one of the greatest games for the past twenty years. with mod support in place, skyrim will likely beyond everyones hard drive for years to come.",38.1

"skyrim, it seems, is a game that people buy expecting it to be the best or the worst game ever. when they plunge in, most people think its very good, with its beautiful world, a story thats pretty good (in my opinion), and nice atmospheric music. after you plug in several buttloads of hours, though, it starts to lose its appeal, and gets repetitive. the game mechanics are all very nice, although the combat usually ends up just mindlessly hacking/spurting magic at your enemies. playing as a sneaky thief, however, might help make it more interesting, with bows and whatnot. the story might seem kind of ehhh, but really, i just like the lore. all things considered, skyrim is definitely a worthwhile game.",210.2
"skyrim is one of the greatest games ive ever played, and with a handful of mods it is probably the single greatest game in my modest steam library. for me, its all about immersion. the land of skyrim is richly atmospheric, as many games are, but it is also organic. from the most mundane cellars to the windswept mountaintops and everything that lies between, the land of skyrim was painstakingly crafted, with equal parts skill and love, to be a living and breathing place. find a tavern and take a seat, and the little village lives on without you. youll find yourself, even on second or third characters, discovering new conversations and overhearing new dialogue; youll stumble into new random events, and forge brand new paths to the same old objectives. the very landscape, even, takes on new angles as your characters develop into different people with different direction, loyalties, and perspectives. i have never actually completed the main storyline of skyrim. this is due not only various glitches that make missions unable to accomplish (most of these caused by conflicting mods, not the game in its original state), but also because only very rarely are you ever pressed to follow the structured storylines or sidequests. from the beginning, you can choose to join the nords or the imperials and see where each path takes you. you can join a number of guilds. but neutrality, or even hostility towards these parties, is completely possible and maybe even preferable after a few playthroughs. skyrim is made even better through a number of mods. enbs and texture enhancements, bug fixes, user created quests, companions, armor and weapons, and even entire islands to explore - there are literally thousands of mods available and in a very brief time one can accumulate hundreds and consider many of them to be absolutely must have... many mods exist to cater to whatever your thing or niche might be. as a history and anthropology student, i thought itd be cool if the imperials didnt just emulate soldiers of the roman empire, but actually looked like them. i was part of the historical revival team as an artist and historical consultant  our mod, which also includes some celtic and eastern equipment and weaponry, received over a thousand endorsements from the nexus community before we abandoned the project. during holiday sales, skyrim is hitting the $10 mark (or possibly even lower). for the layers upon layers of entertainment this game offers, it is almost criminal to not own this game.",252.1
"skyrim... oh my where to start... helgan would be a great place to start seeming thats the first town you see in the game, and my oh my its one of many, and i mean many! skyrim is a fantastic open world, free roam game in which you create a character to help you complete the hundred, maybe even thousands of main story, and side quests! in skyrim you play however you want to play as, be it a mage, archer, warrior, even a human cat! you can go where you want, when you want with use of skyrims fast travel, but if you really want, how about you just get there on foot, meet some people on the way, maybe you meet someone who needs help, maybe you meet someone who is out to kill you! its all possible in skyrim! skyrim is one of my all time favourite games, when im bored, i play skyrim because even though i have played it for 100+ hours, im always finding new places, new people, new missions and more! also skyrim has the steam workshop and the nexus mod community behind its back, so if you do get bored with vanilla skyrim, there are thousands of downloadable quests and mods to keep you entertained for hours on end! final rating of tes:skyrim : 9.8/10",147.6

"ok! its time to finally review this masterpiece; now that im 400+ hours into my first playthrough, that is skyrim has a lot of good things going for it; ill list my top 3 1) the exploration--exploration has always been top-tier for me in elder scrolls games. here skyrim, like the other es games ive played, does not disappoint. the world is ginormous, tons of places to go, quite varied topography and regions, graphics of course are gorgeous despite the occasional clipping error, very forgivable. 2) the perks--skyrim is the first es game with a dedicated perk tree and if youre familiar with perks in other games, skyrims tree is similar--the perks are great, many to which i said oh nice! they are gonna let me do that! perks give a player a good reason to continually level up, to get that next perk point they need...just one...more... 3) the writing--while nothing stands up to bioware writing in my book, skyrim has excellent rpg writing and quests, continuing the strong standards set in the previous games. while im not a fan of the main story in any es game ive played so far, skyrim and the others make up for that by giving a plethora of well-rounded written quests with a very respectable main questline this time, better than morrowind & oblivions. what i love most about skyrims writing, though, is the centuries-deep backstory and history of what has happened in the host country of tamriel since oblivion. it is rich and detailed and some of the in-game books you can read are not to be missed, some will just crack you up. there is a lot more to say about this game but in general, you will enjoy it if you like exploration, dungeon-crawling, or racking up phat lewtz, which tends to happen a lot. add customizable houses (if you get hearthfire or legendary edition), a finally good magic system, dual-wielding weapons or spells (a first to the series), the entire mod spectrum for pc players, pretty decent allied ai, and nearly infinite leveling with legendary, skyrim will have you playing almost forever...or till you drop dead or quit going to work, either quite likely imo. skyrim is a relationship breaker, im sorry, it just is, learn to deal with it. the clincher? those of you looking for a nice long rpg to sink time into, i spent my first 200 hours simply exploring the world, doing some side quests but mainly just following riverbanks or roads, clearing everything along the way, didnt even down my first dragon until 225 or so, and even then id only uncovered half the map. add in the 2 big expansion packs and you will be set for a long while. and thats just the official non-mod content. wait for a sale to buy legendary edition, it is so worth it.",587.3

"i used to be a bethesda dev working on skyrim. i tried to make sleeping a meaningful mechanic, as player recover as they sleep. i also designed cool dream themed menus with deep proverbs while opposing factions may try to assassinate you while you sleep in late-game. i geniunely believed this would be very immersive, a neat break from the flow for players to think and plan their character. todd howard, however, was not as pleased. he calls me out during a meeting, belittles me in front of our coworkers and calls me dreamboy. the whole company now makes fun out of me and calls me dreamboy. i got demoted, but i kept working. i thought about how to make the passing of in-game time more meaningful. the dragon apocalypse happens on day 50 and the aldmeri dominion invades on day 100. this would immerse the player in a sense of heroism and danger. when i go to the toilet after finishing these changes... todd finds me and repeatedly punches me in the liver and solar plexus while calling my son an autistic r*tard. i got demoted to janitors closet now. i still tried to make the best of it and kept working hard. i made it so that npcs from the opposing faction are hostile, and you have to sneak or disguise yourself if you want to do business in solitude as a stormcloak, for example. to me, this would make the game intense and real. i come home later that day and found my wife crying in the living room, and when i asked whats wrong, she said that a man approached our son at school and asked him if its hard to be a r*tard with a f*g dad. although i should have stopped at this point, i felt like it was still my duty to make this game as good as possible. i wanted to include an optional hardcore mode like in new vegas - i believed this would immerse players as it would make food and taverns meaningful. later that night when i took out the trash, someone throws a bag over my head. i hear people laughing and making fun out of me as someone is stomping on me. then suddenly, after taking kicks and punches for a long time, someone pulls the bag off me. i felt a wet finger pressing against my anal. i hear todds voice saying, is that hardcore enough for you, dreamboy? no one talks to me at work and my old friends act like i dont exist. i give this game a 7/10 because i had to install a bunch of mods to make up for all the scrapped content. it is, however, a great game to waste time in, if thats what youre looking for.",271.8

"beautilful, unique, and charming... skyrim provides better experience of this rpg open-world series. beside the main quest and radiant sidequest which can surprise you in different events. pretty genuis scripts and storyline lead you to new places, new conflicts, and dragons as random encounter. the level system is not new, but it has improvement and design. places are full of mysteries, activites, and npcs, lifefull indeed. smithing and enchanting are deep and impact to your combat as magics and shouts are balanced and provide new tactics. i could say im in love with this fifth series. even some people may face with minor bugs (for me, it just minor graphic bugs now.) inventory system is hard to track (fix by using skyrim ui mod) and problem in ai direction. all i say it just common thing in this kind of game which cant interrupt you from amazing experience. totally worthy in every dollar/baht you paid. whatever you are fan of series or not. try once in your owned. :)",458.1

"during my first run through skyrim, i played as an argonian battle mage. i know this seems strange, but things were going well. when i played the main quest diplomatic immunity and i went to the thalmor embassy, i forgot armor. i was a naked argonian, fighting mages who used frost spells... as you can imagine i was unable to continue, and i had no saves before i gave my gear to malborn (i also forgot i was a werewolf lel). this frustrated me to the point where i was up late one night, contemplating of greater things, my final decision was to delete my character forever. i was crushed that this was the only way, so i had a huge falling out with skyrim, i started playing other games, such as call of duty. call of duty was filling the whole in my emotional roof that skyrim had left, but there was still a leak. i realized that skyrim was always there for me, through thick and thin, we were a team. thats when i rushed to the store, bought a new copy of skyrim for myself, and 50 others to give out to strangers on the street. now i am a happy man, do yourself a favor, buy this game, and buy a second copy to give to your future spouse, so when you inevitably divorce them to be with skyrim, they too can have a copy to love and cherish. happy thanksgiving everyone!",73.7

"ah, skyrim, what a wonderful game. time and time again i have found myself returning to the snowy, beautiful landscape that is this games portrayal of tamriel, each time making a new character, and finding new ways to play. what can i say about this game? a lot, actually. first of all, the game looks astounding. the dark feel creates an atmosphere like none other, but it somehow remains silly with all of the bugs never fixed (im looking at you, movement approximation.) the enemies are unique, not so much in their abilities, but in their style. in the open landscapes youll find necromancers and wolves, but in dungeons and caves youll draugr (the equivalent of zombies), skeletons, and sometimes machines made by the ancient race called the dwemer. things like this make environments special and interestingly varied. the one complaint i have with the beauty is that the great mountains you can see in the distance throughout your travels arent always so spectacular. when trying to traverse the countryside, the mountains usually just get in the way. travelling around them is the easiest option, but by using the aforementioned bugs you can run up vertical slopes and clear them, if not entirely easily. the elder scrolls series is praised for its customization, and skyrim offers the same amount as any other. each type of weapon has its own skill tree, and cambining certain powers can make the game exceedingly fun. an assassin is not limited to blades, oh no. there is a school of magic that can aid in sneaking, and can come in handy when difficult situations present themselves. or, you can be a battleaxe weilding mage if you so desire, using conjuration and alteration magic can grant defense and weapons without the toll on your inventory that real armor takes. more examples exist, and playing the game can reveal them. quests are more fun in this game than most others i feel. while in many rpgs quests are there just for the sake of having them, skyrim was built around them. bethesda got voice actors to record lines for dozens of questlines, and the quests themselves consist of more than kill that thing, or get that other thing. they have plots and unique impacts on the world. making them much more substancial feeling than those of, say, quest of dungeons quests, which are essentially fetch quests. skyrim is not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination, but whether youre looking for an rpg to get involved in, or just a time waster, this game has something to satisfy everone. 87/100 buy it, dumbutt.",170.8

"possibly the best game ive ever played, second to none. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is without a doubt one of if not the best open-world role playing games of this generation. endless replayability, an unsurpassable amount of mods, a unique experience and countless hours to waste away enjoying the immersion this game has to offer. bethesda truely excelled previous elder scroll games with this release. the pros; > open-world, beautifuly designed. > detailed character creation and arcehtype building. > 300+ hours of playable content. > extremely lore based. > truely immersive storyline. > excellent audio. > well designed game mechanics including combat, leveling, perks. > vast array of weaponry, armor, spells, potions and much much more. > mass amounts of mods, ranging from graphic, gameplay, item, house, and character mods. > a substantial amount of enemies ranging from dragons, bandits, draugrs, thieves to vampires. the cons; > voice acting is repetitive. one several occasions you will notice npcs voiced by the same actor with the same voice. > replayability is much lower without the use of mods. > some areas of the large open-world seem reused. there seems to be little variation to open world textures and dungeons. > questing can sometimes seem repetitive. go to x, get y item, return to z. to finish this up ive put over 500 hours into skyrim across three systems (xbox, ps3 and now the pc), ive never felt as immersed into a games storyline, open-world and lore - it is truely a different experience to any other open-world rpg. the character creation and arcehtype building is perfect for this type of role playing game. want to play through the game from a stealth approach, done. want to tank more damage than a german panzer in ww2, done. want to fire, frost and electrify your way through every bandit camp and dungeon in the vicinity, done.there is literally no limit, dont want to stick to a specific arcetype? done, jack of all trades. with 10 playable races, youre able to customize your character to your own liking and fight the way you believe you should. with 18 skills ranging from archery, lockpicking, two-handed, destruction, restoration, smithing and many in between theres plenty of variety. leveling never feels monotonous, level at your own pace or powerlevel before youve even started the main quest. play the game your way. with over 270 quests, including the main quest, side quests and sub quests, theres never a dull moment. youll be lucky to even finish half of them before you take an arrow to the knee. i could not recommend this game more highly. if you even have the slighest interest in rpgs or open-world games take the plunge and pick this game up.",51.8

"the elder scrolss v: skyrim......oh boy....this here ladies and gents, is the game you buy and play if you want to lock yourself up in a room for 267 hours worth of you life dedicated to doing all the crap in this fantasticly fantasmic world of elves and orcs and intelligent walking dinosaurs. skyrim is big. really...big. and thats not just accounting for the world map im talking about the quests, weapons, skills, mods (very important btw. once you use mods you can never go back to vanilla skyrim again.), and pretty much everything the game has to offer is downright amazing. but i do have a few nickpicks. dont get me wrong though reader of my little review here, skyrim is my favorite in the series of the elder scrolls, but that might be because its the only es i have ever played in my life o_o anyway, the game does suffer from some things here and there. the modloader is great in all, but the major problem i have with it is that it doesnt tell you what mods are conflicting or not, so youll be playing the game and it just closes for no reason. if theres a setting that you can adjust so you can see the conflicting mods then plz send me a pm and regard my last statement as irrelevent. skyrim also suffers from an extreme amount of what i like to call grey effect. what does this mean? it means skyrim looks very bland and washed out. nothing really stands out unless you use mods like increased saturation boost or increased contrast boost and other types of shader mods. another thing i have a nick pick with is that fact that at the end of the game, the cool armor you once wore like nightingale, shroud armor, thiefs guild, etc. become incredibly inferior to the dragon versions. imho i really dont like the look of the dragon armors. they give myself of a sense of character. it makes my interesting dragonborn not so interesting. the last topic i have to cover is mages. i...hate....mages.......pretty much one hit kills once you reach level 28 and above if you dont have like level 80 enchanting so you can have resistances. they are broken. and the player version of a mage is just not worth it. its just not worth it. but it does add a bit of challenge fun here and there. thats my review! hope you enjoyed it! i definitley recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of open world games and rpgs. peace-",350.6

"how does one review a game that never ends? gameplay wise, the game is tightly designed, and very effective. but it is not perfect. the plotlines are hit or miss. there are some real gems in characters here. you have the jarls, each of which is well developed. the guild heads are just as well(if not better.) however some characters are simply dull or annoying. by the aforementioned information, you may think this a mediocre rpg. oh, you could not be more wrong. when you enter the game, you enter a new world. this game is truly an accomplishment in open-world storytelling. the different reigons of the province all feel different, from swampy hjallmarch to the colorful forests of the reach. the game presents you with an intersting world to explore, with interesting dynamics with regards to the imperial-leaning western reigon and the nordic-leaning eastern reigon. to give you an example, we can look at whiterun, the center of the games action in its main questline. you have a king who cant decide which side of a war to join, but who wants to do right by his people, you have an aspiring shopkeeper, a landowner who needs an axe to the skull, a shopkeeper who only wants to care for her daughter, two brothers running a tavern and a shop, a healer, a evangelical preacher of an illegal religon, a smith who wants to prove herself, and others. these characters have personality. it is a step up from oblivions inconsequential npcs. the game looks great, and has its own artistic style which works well. as other reviewers have said, the open world is perfectly crafted, down to the troll who killed your horse. it is not a perfect game, the civil war and dragon questlines are lackluster, and the magic system is lacking a large selection of spells and any intersting flavor. the combat can be clunky at times. is the game good? yes. is it the messianic game? no. should you buy it? yes. oh, and also, mod the hell out of this game.",111.6

"okay. this is the greatest game ive ever played. just getting that out. in the uninspired craphole of call of duty and battlefield, this game is a massive breathe of fresh air. everthing is virtually perfect the visuals the music the combat the item system everything is immaculate this is the first fantasy game in years to feel like a fantasy game. everything feels so unique and well done. the npcs feel real, the visuals immerse you so quickly youll be completely unaware of anything going on around you. at first the story seems very cliche but it works incredibley. the story mode is the perfect length. its not as depressingly short as batman: arkham city yet not as annoying long as portal 2. even if the story doesnt quite quench your thirst for adventure, there are hundreds of side quests and side quest lines to keep you occupied the levelling system is smooth, and you actually have to practice to level up in any given skill tree. want to level one-handed combat? grab a one-handed sword, head into the wilds and start slaughtering. want to level illusion spells? equip some, find some test subjects and see what your spells can do. i have this game on xbox 360 and pc, and i honestly prefer the xbox version but, there is one thing the pc can do that consoles cant. mods there are thousands of mods that can do anything from adding a huge arena to the vast game world, to making npcs run indoors when a dragon attacks a village. mods can help you iron out the few imperfections this game has. the game world is vast, sprawling and beautiful. anything from a shack inhabited by a little old lady who turns out be an evil and powerful witch, to huge and active cities full of lootable shops, houses that can all be broken into and individual and interesting npcs that interact with you in different ways depending on how you act. with unique and hand-crafted temples and dungeons, villages deep in the mountains, lairs inhabited by sleeping dragons and secret crypts that all somehow link to a quest. saying this game has good graphics is a massive understatement. the textures look a little low-res when you get up close but the world never fails to immerse you with its beauty and realism there are 3 basic ways to go in this game: the warrior, the thief and the mage. if you choose the path of the warrior you will be responible for levelling thing like one-handed, two-handed, blocking and heavy armour, which eventually allows you to pulverize any enemy who dare stand in your way. if you choose the path of the thief (like i did) you will have to level skill like lockpicking, pickpocketing (my personal favourite) and sneak, which allows you to slither through any nook and cranny silently and maybe doing some looting if you choose the path of the mage, you will have to level skills such as illusion, destruction, conjuration and restoration, which allow you to apply paralysis, poisoning and enslavement on any and all npcs. restoration, however, allows you to heal the wounds of you and your allies. the dlc packs for this game include in order: dawnguard, hearthfire and dragonborn. dawnguard is my favourite of the 3. in it, you are told of a vampire hunting group called the dawnguard. if you visit fort dawnguard, you will be sent to castle volkhier, were you will meet, you guessed it, vampires!!! at this point youre given the choice to join the vampires and reek havok or get the hell out of there and return to fort dawnguard and become a vampire hunter. i wont spoil anything but its definately worth what it costs. hearthfire is rather simple. this expansion pack allows you to purchase land, build a home and start a family. its nice but building a house is hard work, which i enjoy, but you need a lot of patience. finally, dragonborn. i didnt like dragonborn that much, but it was a fun expansion and definately worth it. tip: if you stand atop the highest southern mountain on a clear day, you can see whitegold tower in cyrodil, from oblivion! how cool is that!?!? bethesda has created the perfect western rpg and one i will compare future wrpgs to in the future. it may sound like im kissing bethesdas  here, but they deserve nothing less after this masterpiece. if you were a fan of any elder scrolls game before this, you will enjoy the hell out of skyrim. the elder scrolls v: skyrim easily earns the score of 10/10. perfect if youve bothered to read this far without running off and buying the game, do it. now. you cant realize what a good game is until you play this game.",178.2

"after i stopped regularly playing games on the ps2 years ago, i was lucky i could sit down for more than 15 minutes at a time with any game at all. this game shattered that trend entirely and left me glued to my computer desk for days. theres just so much to do and discover that skyrim always leaves you wanting more. with a seemingly endless supply of adventure, skills, and battle, those easily sidetracked can find themselves a dozen or more hours into the game before ever killing their first dragon in the story quests should they feel so inclined to dally. even once the story is complete, there is still a tremendous content that can be accessed. when all is said and done, you can always play through with a new character for a different experience thanks to the huge collection of skills, perks, and equipment to compliment whichever race you choose. between the main quest line, the massive world, the extensive list of sidequests and dungeons, game expansion content, and a huge list of mods to choose from, theres something for nearly everyone.",141.8

"skyrim is one of those games that have a very poor storyline the truth is that it takes only about an hours to finish skyrim main storyline. and if you play for good storyline dont buy skyrim get a different game. skyrim is that kind of game where every dungeon will look the same each side quest will be generic and similar, however what makes skyrim a game i will recommend to others is the ability to do what you want as a player. skyrim allows you to freeroam in a huge open world, as well as ability to mod the game. modding this game is what it means to play skyrim download 30+ mods and explore endless possibilities. if you like to mess around with games and you wouldnt mind to spend few minutes to understand how to add mods to your game then pick skyrim because i could play this game for days with no sleep as long as i find a good pack of mods. however without the mods this game can only keep one interested for 10hours or so.",222.2

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim has given me more pleasure in playing a game, than any other game has given me. as soon as you hit start new game, the graphics blow you away, even the loading screen with alduin sitting on the word wall looks amazing. the dialogue matches them mouth movements, which is alway a plus, and the voice acting is suberb (even though you tend to hear different characters with the same voice). as i said the graphics of this game are like no other you will see in a game made in 2011, however, the one critique i have is the water textures, as many a time i have come across patches of water that is invisible, but, the majority of the game is spent on land so that tends to not affect your gameplay. the story is good, but sometimes it lacks a certain quality that you tend to notice. the one major problem i have with the game is the (spoliers) battle for whiterun, it is suppossed to be a large scale seige, but it turns out to be 20 stormcloaks charging at 30 imperials. the battle at either solitude or windhelm is only slightly better. despite those problems i believe that skyrim deserves the title of 2011-2012 game of the year. it extensive lore, its hours of leveling, its interesting (someties) story lines and its massive replay value make this game one of the best role playing games made, you can easily sink 200+ hours into your first play-through without even finishing the main story line.",268.2

"i heard someone call this a mile wide and an inch deep once, and thats a perfect way to describe it. bethesda is utterly amazing at building worlds, but when it comes to putting quests and characters in those worlds they fail, miserably. take the civil war for instance. skyrim is caught between the empire (the good guys) and the stormcloaks (idiots one and all, and the bad guys. if they win, the real big bads, the aldmeri dominion who are basically magical nazi elves get one step closer to wiping out humanity altogether.) you can win the civil war for one side or another, and.... nothing happens. sure some guards change pants and maybe two or three npcs say a sliiiiiightly different thing now, but thats it. oh and you win the civil war by doing a fetch quest and then going to a city and killing waves of utterly identical faceless soldiers. four or five times. i guess what im saying here is theres no replay value at all. theres one way to do something and thats it. no choosing to do it a different way later in another playthrough because there is no other way. oh and if you care about sane, coherent plots, do not buy dawnguard. the only possible way that could make sense is if your character literally becomes temporarily . full on window licking wearing inflatable waterwings in the bath so you dont drown .",516.7

"november 11, 2011 was a great day, because bethesda graced us with one of the greatest games every created. skyrim is the 5th installment of the elder scrolls series; and oh boy does it ever take it to the next level. what does skyrim have you may ask? in depth character development, player housing, kill-able npcs, anything that isnt nailed to the wall or ground can be stolen, tons of weapons and magic spells, play as a werewolf or vampire, hundreds of quests, an enormous world, and oh yeah dragons! skyrim is an rpg that has a great main story with tons of side quests that either have nothing to do with the main story arc or have everything to do with it. i couldnt stop playing the game as every corner, every road or just over that mountain had something new to do or experience. and the experiences were increased exponentially with the environmental detail and sound that made you feel like you were in the world itself. do you want to be a heavy armor wearing archer, a dual wielding wizard, a vampire, or maybe you just want to be an assassin; your choices of character combinations are extensive. each aspect of your character has a skill tree and actions like merely sneaking around will improve its skill and unlock a skill point with each passing level that can be used to specialize that ability even more. and after you spend time specializing your character, you have to move on to customizing their gear. skyrim is a must own for rpg lovers, gamers who enjoy open worlds and if you love dragons; how do you not already have this game? + beautiful visuals + great sounds and music + detailed and engrossing stories + great combat + open world and very customizable character progression - can be overwhelming for people new to the series - some glitches during combat (very minimal) score: 10 out of 10",131.8
"this game is probably one of the best moddable game i have ever played. there are so many, many things you can do and you can be anything you want to be on skyrim. it has almost never-ending quests and a big place to exploring around. this game is for the true adventure lovers. i would totally recommend you to buy this game! 2 thumb up! skyrim 4 life!",133.2
"great game. the best open-world game bethesda has made yet in my opinion. now with the dlcs the game seems endless, and you will spend many dozens of hours just questing alone even before exploring all of skyrim. hope you have a lot of extra time on your hands. ;)",465.8
"you play as luigi and you must save the mushroom kingdom from dragons. mario was turned into a dragon but he good dragon. luigi shouts really loud cause he is scared of dragons. luigi cant fit dragons in a vacuum so he stabs them with arrows and swords, and his own fists. its a pretty good game, everyone calls me some dragonborn i stab them and then say im luigi.",39.7

"we all know this game and how  it was on the consoles. we all agree that this game is 100 times better on pc due to mods and enhancements that can be modified and added. this game is incredible in its own way. yes, it has a considerable amount of glitches and bugs which can be fixed using official patches from the skyrim nexus. there are a lot of things you are missing from this game. it has incredible mods that you will never get to experience. which is a shame since it is one of the biggest workshops on steam. there are mods that add more killmoves, characters, races, weapons, armours, animals + beasts, immersive mods, enviroments, gameplay aspects, and more. there are enbs which enhance skyrim immensely. literarily, a brain . there are mods that can create better characters that dont look like hobos from downtown. this game is excellent for those who seek adventure, great mods, and roleplaying.",315.1

"surely a game this massive in scale requires a review of similar proportion. where do i begin? the graphics? the gameplay? the lore? ill start at the beginning. first off, this game is nothing like roller coaster tycoon. in fact, skyrim and rct are about as far away from each other on the spectrum of gaming as they can be. so if youre looking for a quality theme park building/management simulator (or any theme park building/management simulator), do not look to the elder scrolls series. you begin your quest as a lowly prisoner in the back of a wagon. the offense is border hopping, and the punishment is death by axe (sure beats a big ol wall, huh u.s. government?). on the way to the execution you meet fellow prisoner roggvir, a key member in a group of rebels called the stormcloaks, who want to take back skyrim from the imperial legion (the people who are executing you) and put the nords back in command. when you arrive at the execution...place in helgen, a guard asks you for your name. now say what you want about the imperial legion, but these people have some patience. i sat there for 45 minutes thinking of a name and rearranging my race, face, and gender to my liking, and they just waited for me to finish. finally i decided on jikrel, a magician/juggler inspired by my hero, penn jillette. properly named and pampered, im ready to get my head chopped off! just before the axe comes down, however, a conveniently timed plot device* swoops down and proceeds to burn the city to the ground. it is at this point that the player can decide whether to escape with roggvir, the handsome rebel with a cause, or someoneelseiforgothisname, a dirty imperial pig. while the choice doesnt make a difference at this point in the game, it presents the player with the concept of choosing sides in a convoluted, almost entirely pointless side quest involving the great civil war of skyrim. racist rebels or idiotic imperials? the choice is yours to make (or not). once youve escaped, youre free to go anywhere in the overworld you desire, do any side quests you want, tackle the main storyline, or just goof around and break the games a.i. i opted for the latter. dont get me wrong, there are a lot of things to do in skyrim, its just that most of them arent fun or interesting. i tried to give the main quest a go, but around the seventeenth plot device* and ninth fetch quest or so, i just got sick of it and quit. i had to replace the stock plot device* fighthing music to a pitched-down rendition of frank zappas no not now just to make it that far. im going to be honest here: the most fun ive had playing this game ive had roleplaying a psychopathic serial rap-ist/ene-ma bandit/murderer that slits peoples throats, dry humps their still warm corpses and dumps them in the nearest river/crevice/humorous location he can find. what this says about myself, i dont know. but i do know what it says about the games quests: theyre not good. in fact, i found the games quests were obstructing my overall goal of blindly murdering everything in my path. ever since oblivion, bethesda has felt the need to make certain npcs that are essential to the games completion unkillable. i had to download a mod so that i could kill them and thus continue having fun. oh, and dont get me started on the mods! nude mods, better female mods, sexy armor mods, what is this a sick joke?! how horny are you people?! but i digress. to sum it up: skyrim is worse than oblivion because it is better than oblivion. bethesda dont seem to realize that their games are inherently goofy and are perfect that way. the more they try to make it badass or epic or the more bad face textures and a.i. bugs they fix the worse it gets. i dont even think the intended audience for these games takes them seriously considering the number of great dumb mods there are out there (battletoad rash!) all in all, id buy it because its still a pretty enjoyable experience and im sure everybody can find something to do in this massively dumb role-playing action-adventure game. oh, and the graphics are pretty good i guess. 7/10 *plot device=dragon",117.0

"ahhh, skyrim. returning to the continent of tamriel after oblivion, skyrim is a huge, beautiful, entertaining game that has much of what made oblivion grand, while changing, omiting or adding to that formula to make the game even more compelling. the crafting and enchanting of items, for example, gives a personal tocuh for those who want to forge their own destiny with their own hand-made tools. the vistas and terrain is nothing short of beautiful, with sprawling ruins, vast mountains, snowy peaks, grassy highlands, wooded areas and even a volcanic/hot springs type area. the main quest is . . . much like any bethesda main quest. servicable, but not specifically stunning. however, music, visuals, small, personal little legends in dungeons, and those little stories told in the severed outstretched arm reaching for a treasure box, the dungeon specific quests, the little errands that can turn into something sprawling the entire land, books whose information can lead you on a merry chase to adventure and treasure, and last but not least the dragons and the shouts (special powers you gain over time exploring and finding words of power-type walls) that are unlocked and empowered by dragons souls all push this game up to one of my favorite games ive ever played. nothing compares to the rush of a legendary dragon attacking a settlement, and you rushing to defend it. if you can swing the expansions, you can also build your own houses, sail to a strange and almost alien island, and contend with skyrims vampires as well. the house building is the next logical step for anyone who sees the game itself as little more than a reason to craft their own items because they are awesome. the island of solstheim is both strange and engaging for me in much the same way the alien realm of the mad god was in oblivion. and the vampires are fun if for no other reason than theyve gotten bold enough to attack settlements, leading again to a battle between vamps, you and the city inhabitants. for the uninitiated, though, games like this on the computer run very well with mods, and this is no exception. my favorites of those (i found them on nexus mods, im not sure how many are on the steam workshop as well) are run for your lives (citizens will hide when a dragon attacks), when vampires attack (the same but for when vamps attack settlements), glowing ore 300 (because otherwise ore is very hard to pick out), water (makes water prettier), green water fix (fixes a problem of not being able to see anything underwater because patches are fun) and finally all the unoffical patches (because they make the game run smoother). the tl; dr version? for the massive adventure it is, skyrim is a must have for any adventerous soul. just note that both mods and the expansions do nothing but enhance the experience. ;)",422.3

"if youve not played skyrim yet you are missing out. its not just another fantasy game, like the games that came before its an open world exploration game. the goal of the game is not just to finish the main quest line, but to explore the world and see what you can find. exploration is where the game really shines, you can be lost for hours walking around the world and finding different and unique areas. brave the crypts full of undead for special loot, walk along the frozen northern coast and maybe youll find a wrecked ship home to bandits. just walking through the world is exciting, a blizzard blows in and suddenly youre attacked by a sabretooth tiger, youre running through the blinding snow hoping to find a cave or building you can hide in. combat is more of a mixed affair, skyrim has a little bit of everything; melee, magic, archery and stealth, but you may find the lack of options can be slightly boring. theres no combo system, just a few different types of attacks depending on how youre moving and if you hold down the attack button when youre attacking. combat magic consists of direct attacks, ground attacks, and summoned weapons. archery consists of holding down your attack button to attack farther away. stealth is used to get around tough monsters, or combines with archery or melee combat to give bonuses to your attacks most of the time you wont be jumping into swarms of enemies, but where they do make you jump into swarms of enemies the combat is lacking. you may find yourself surrounded and your only option is to backup while swinging your weapon or casting a spell; kratos you are not. while combat is lacking i would not say its a big detriment to the game as the game does not revolve around constant combat. the vast majority of combat is one on one, and when you do come across multiple enemies you can always make your way around with a good use of stealth. the graphics are fairly good. some textures up close do not look good, while others look amazing. the mountains look particularly good, covered in snow and generally looking imposing. environmental effects like the aforementioned blizzard look amazing, not because they look like a real weather but because of the feeling theyll give you. when youre in a blizzard youll feel like youre actually in a blizzard, the cold seems to seep into the room and youll start to shiver. weapons, armor and magic effects look great, with weapons and armor having many different unique looks to them. of course not all is well. in the aforementioned blizzard i came across many people that looked more like they were out for a nice stroll than in the middle of the blizzard. instead of the expected hunched over for warmth they walk through as though nothing is happening, and its not just the nords doing it, its everybody. as already mentioned some of the textures are rather bland, and distant areas can look rather ugly, although bethesda did their best to avoid long stretches of empty space. sound is great. there are many different tracks of music that will play during the game, all of which i enjoyed. dragons roar from far away, the sound echoing through the mountains. weapons clang, electric magic sounds sound like electricity, flame magic sounds like what you may imagine a flame thrower sounds like. voice acting is significantly better than oblivion, with many more voice actors. youll still come across people that have their voice change though. what really makes the world though is how alive it is. almost everything is intractable. walk into a house and steal all the cups, walk through a field and pick flowers or catch butterflies. every npc thats not a monster has a schedule they follow, and not just a static schedule, one npc may be told that during the day they need to just wander about town, while another may be told to find every caliper they can get their hands on. these types of interactions really bring the world alive, and nothing feels as though its just a facade, everything feels real and alive.",112.2
"do i really need to say anything about this game? no. the answer is no. thats because every single person and their great-grandmother has heard of skyrim, especially how good it is. with good reason, too. it is indeed a very fun game with quite a lot to do, especially since the steam workshop integration allows for a whole plethora of different experiences. want to ride around on a dragon dressed as a space marine wielding a lightsaber in one hand and a chainsword in the other? then bugger me sideways youre in for a treat. of course, some people like their games to remain lore friendly. theres plenty of mods like that too, i guess. the main story isnt much to really say about. go places, do stuff, get rewards such as weapons and shouts and boom, youve got some beastly arsenal to back yourself up with. however you could indeed tell skyrim to go shove it as you run off to become an assassin instead. or a thief. or a werewolf. or a vampire. hell, the list goes on. as for the mods? -breathes in- weapon mods, race mods, clothing mods, modded play homes, modded spells, addition mounts, different mechanics, improved graphics, realism mods, location mods, additional enemies, companion mods... hot damn, this stuffs endless. really you could just play this game forever and still have stuff to do. i give it a thumbs up.",129.9

"this game starts out all well and good. it looks decent, the soundtrack is nice, and the intro quest is exciting (the first time). after about 4 hours i started to really notice how shallow it was though. every quest seemed to involve going into a cave to kill bandits/zombies and retrieve item x to give to person y. you can be good at everything in the world with one character, from the worlds deadliest assassin to the leader of a group of werewolf warriors to the archmage of a college of magic. the combat never strays far from clicking rapidly until your health runs low, downing a few potions, repeat. harder difficulties only make combat take longer, it doesnt actually make it harder.that being said there is quite an extensive mod community and everything thats wrong with the game has been fixed and everything you could ever imagine can be added to your game. tl;dr: is it fun? yes (with mods)",69.7

"two years later and this game got its hooks into me as if it came out yesterday. thanks to the vibrant modding community skyrim today is a different beast from what came out back in 2011. if youre not afraid to get your hands a bit dirty (and for the essential mods its really not complicated at all) you can fix a bunch of bugs bethesda never got to, improve the ui significantly and enjoy a much smoother experience. if youre a bit bolder then the sky is the limit as to how far you can take this game - change all the perk trees with mods like skyre or requiem, bump up the ai difficuly with the combat overhaul mod, immerse yourself in the skyrim wilderness experience with frostfall and hunterborn, or if you have a beefy machine install an enb mod and enjoy amazing visuals that stand up really well to current gen graphics. ive racked up at least 200 hours of gameplay with skyrim and still going - i dont expect ill be stopping until the next elder scrolls game comes out (not the mmo though).",281.3

"its the first bethesda game that actually a piece of the cake. the game has amazing stories with good and bad missions and long gameplay! the graphics is ok (there are games that has way better graphics), awesome and easy system, huge open-world, which is somewhere good, somewhere boring or even be bad. recommended only for rpg fans. 9.5/10 :)",73.8
"fairly decent game, especially with mods. has a large open world, however most of the content is the same from dungeon to dungeon. mods are pretty much a must in my opinion, as they do a number of things, from increasing the difficulty of higher levels, making it look much better, to fixing a number of broken or exploitable mechanics. i would recommend skyui at the very least to make the ui much more usable for someone in with a mouse.",231.0
"the game by itself is good, a little buggy, but sets the bar for open world adventure. the real draw here is the modding potiential. i have close to 1000hrs in skyrim over multiple playthroughs, testing and playing with different mods that enhance and augment the skyrim experience. mods add so much to this game that i dont know how to accurately convey it in one small review. great game, hours of fun. would buy again.",934.5

"one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences i have had. the base game is amazing enough, though the main quest is rather short and gets less exciting every time you start a new game. the dlcs add quite a bit of gameplay and new content, and dont forget about the tens of thousands of mods to choose from to further enhance the game. it removes many of the spells that were in morrowind and oblivion, but replaces them with new powers and shouts. there is no acrobatics skill, so jumping height is very limited, but replaces it with a sprinting function. many things are missing from previous titles character development, but there are mods to remedy this. after many hours of playing skyrim, youll learn that many of the games wondrous encounters, npcs, and environments (towns, cities, dungeons, etc.) start to taste a bit sour, and get repetitive and boring. but with mods in tow, youll never have a bad experience while playing this game. skyrim is an amazing game, but loses much of its robust taste with every play-through, and soon becomes saccharine. but with the 30,000+ mods available to you, and the official dlcs, this game will never get old, or lose any of its grizzly wonderfulness that you experience the first time around. all-in-all, skyrim (with lots of mods installed) is a must buy for any lover of this game style. highly recommended, and worth every penny.",138.3

"this is hands down one of the greatest rpgs of all time..... the elder scrolls v has proven to still be one of the finest pieces of art bethesda has published and is still proven to be a masterpeice nearly two years on. whether you quest for weapons, armour or just seek adventure this game has it all. in terms of gameplay, while the combat may be seen in some eyes as crap, there are many mods available on the workshop to tweak your game to perfection. the pc edition runs much quicker than ps3/xbox and is greatly obtimised. loading times are minimal and even old computers can run this game fine which is incredible considering the sheer magnitude of the game. sadly this game is only singleplayer but dont let that get to you. talking about it with your friends is just as good :) you will never get bored with the simply hundereds of quests to complete. perhaps you can make personal quests for finding mighty armour or slaying some annoying beasts. maybe you just want to use a dragon shout to knock a giant off a cliff. anything is possible. this game has proven to be in my top 3 favourite games ever made (which is saying something. i have a lot of games). the game is cheaper than ever on steam and has such an amazing community helping out by making and testing mods, giving feedback ect. this game certainly is playable without mods (you are not obliged :d) however, there is something in the workshop for everyone. james wood-dedicated nord with a big sword.",213.3
"an immersive adventure that once you start your journey, youre likely not to stop for a very long time. your path will be rife with bandits, vampires and their thralls, draugr, and of course; dragons. the fifth installment of the elder scrolls series does not disappoint with its sandbox atmosphere and myriads of modding capabilities. there exists a modification for almost every facet of skyrim, enhancing your medieval experience. skyrim is one of the crown jewels of my game collection and rightly so. there is so much pure content in this game, it is excusable for the tens of hours that it will take from you. some may describe it as a timesink, but it is well worth it because for every hour you commit to the game, it takes you further along in your journey and leaves you aching for more. skyrim is undoubtably one of the best games its generation, setting a precedent for future games that strive to outdo what it achieves. skyrim is the one to beat. the score for the game is also fantastic, full of astoundingly great work by jeremy soule. the music that accompanies the events is very period; it goes perfectly with the atmosphere of skyrim. your heart will literally be left pumping as you fight dragons to the sound of one they fear or watch the skies. and the music of sovngarde gives a perfect tone to the afterlife of the nords. overall, skyrim deserves all of the positive acclaim that it garners. it is setting a standard in the gaming world. and renewing the belief in myself that perhaps there is still hope for storytelling in video games. pros: + hours upon hours of gameplay. when you think youre done, youre not. + customization. great character customization, and with mods it reinforces this tenfold. + modability + skill system + no classes + dialogue between npcs. there are always things going on. cons: - initial game physics are a little irritating in places. - at first, it was difficult to find where i was going on the map, but this may have been an individual issue. - so much to do that you dont know what to do. my main gripe. xd",273.6

"the elder scrolls v skyrim as an elder scrolls title its mediocre yet from outside the box its one of the best rpgs out there, if not the best. combat: combat is obviusly a big thing in a game such as this. the melee combat system was hugely improved and doesnt feel like youre slashing air anymore like in previus titles. altough i do have to complain about both archery and magick. archery is pretty much useless as it does very little damage even with those end-game bows and arrows and the magick system just feels dumbed down from previus titles, wich was obviusly to keep new comers interested. story: the main quest is a big clich but they master it amaizingly. during a civil war wich started by a rebellion from the nords to keep the imperials out of their land it is later discovered that the dragon race, wich was previusly extinct, is returning. somehow you are born with the powers of a mythological creature called dragonborn wich is a person who posesses the voice of dragons. so obviusly you are the one to stop this dragon return. the world: the world of skyrim is amaizing. yet the dungeons just seem like the same over and over again. overall: skyrim is a great game but the worst elder scrolls title yet, as it is too dumbed down especially for a fan of the elder scrolls saga like myself.",87.7

"skyrim is probably one of my favorite games of all time. this open-world fantasy game is the fifth installment in the known and loved elder scrolls series. after playing elder scrolls three and four (morrowind and oblivion), i absolutely had to get this game when it first came out. in any case, this game was so amazing that when i got the elder scrolls anthology, i literally made a new steam account for it. which is this account..... this is now my primary account. there is so much i could talk about with this game, but i wanna focus on these things: the evolved combat system this new open world to explore playing how you want to the evolved combat system: since the previous elder scrolls games, the combat system in skyrim had highly evolved. it sorta ties in with the last topic i wanna hit. this is because of how much freedom is given to the player with the combat system. skyrim introduced a dual wielding system, this allows the player to use two single-handed weapons at once, as well as two spells, staves, and so on. this brought a huge change and costumization theme to the game. how one wants to fight is now more based on their preferences. i feel like this is a big step up from being locked into a sword and a shield in oblivion. the only annoying thing about this, is the fact that one cannot wield a spell as well as two other things at one time anymore. i understand why this was done, but it resembles more of a step back than a step forward. moving on.... open world exploration: the world of skyrim is packed with content, and cannot be completed easily. there is so much to this world. tundras, caves, mountains, forests, plains, volcanoes (dragonborn dlc), and so on. thats not all. these places are usually packed with careful detail, and are made to be visually appealing. skyrim is generally a visually appealing game, because of its nice graphics and attention to detail. anyways, back to the main point. skyrim is full of quests, factions, and things to do. there is no way to finish all the in-game quests in one play through. many decisions alter what quests you can recieve, and this makes the game quite replayable. the game also does not punish you for exploring and fooling around on the vast lands of skyrim. mods are also available for skyrim, expanding it quite nicely along with its original content. in any case, this game wont get boring for a while. play like you want to: skyrim is one of the only games to truly give a player freedom over many things. in skyrim, making a character to suit your playstyle is not hard. in fact, player customization is a big part of the game. being able to choose what you want, and how you want it is one of the things that makes this game a masterpiece. with classes removed, the player doesnt have to pick a certain skill set and stay with it. they can choose what they want and design something customized for themselves. also changing a character to become a different kind is easy. if you choose to make your character one way, you can still go back and change it whenever you feel like it. the amount of freedom given to the player in this game is far greater than in any other game. its amazing. get this game. you wont regret it.",98.5

"skyrim is glorious. yes. it is. my first character has logged almost 300 hours into the game. on my first playthrough. i have to admit that this is the first elder scrolls game i actually sat through from start to finish and attempted to explore every single cave, location and gather as many books as possible. i love books. a lot. they are great. my entire playthrough was livestreamed on twitch.tv and looking back there are a lot of fond memories that i have created during my time spent in skyrim. the storyline is enjoyable, but over too quickly. so being the type of gamer i am, i did as many side quests as i could before progressing further into the game. that way it felt like a longer journey and it wasnt over so fast. thats how i play. skyrims visuals are standard at this day and age. mods really do kick up the visuals and make them look beautiful, with enb, hd retextures and added visual features which highlight the fact that its the modding community which have made skyrim what it is today. i played skyrim on a vanilla playthrough but i realised i could not do without a couple of mods to fix the game in order to make it playable. (combat music fix, skyrim script extender, skryim user interface i.e. skyui etc). anyhow, i digress. the gameplay is very addictive, crafting is enjoyable as is upgrading weapons. enchantment is brilliant and exploration is a solid 10/10. yes, i loved exploring skyrim as the world offers so many new things to see. please, buy this game. its always on sale and definitely worth it. the elder scrolls v: skyrim along with all of the dlc installed makes this a truly great rpg, one which you will keep coming back to play all the time :)",288.4

"wonderful game if you want an open world with quite a bit to do. the expansions add more to the wonderful lore that is elder scrolls. a great game, but fairly glitchy, even with mods. recomend going to nexus to find mods that interest you.",124.5
"this game, is a work of art. the minuscule detail gone into this game from the very start. books containing history of tamriel, exchanges to and from little people. even the character configuration allows for major tweaking. the map is massive, the combat system easy to master, and the ais of enemys is amazing. skyrim, is bethesda at its finest, the sheer content keeps one such as myself entertained for hours, and the dlcs even more. from experience id recommend hearthfire to begginners. but this is a review of skyrim, not hearthfire. id reccommend this game to any rpg player. even people who play fps games like cod will love this game, and the sheer beauty is overwhelming. in the end, it doesnt matter who you are, teenager, adult or spoilt child with bad parents, you will love skyrim.",90.7

"a game about how chuck norris thought it would be great to go back to the lord of the ring era and steal all the rings from smaug and all of smaugs relatives while killing most of them in the process [minor spoilers]. after he does this for a bit, he then finds himself riding his trusty mammoth whilst being chased by 3 giants who were upset that chuck killed their brother by punching him in the kneecap. later in the game, norris finds himself running at 30 nordic miles per hour with a mere 567 pounds-worth of swords, bows, and other equipment stored in his pockets when all of the sudden he is attacked by a miniature chicken, which he proceeds to yell at and send it straight into orbit; unfortunately this ticks off all of the mages of the town he is in and when one of the sorcerers spell is cast slightly incorrectly, chuck norris gets sent back into the 80s. after the credits roll you see chuck norris talking to will smith about his tales and about how his life got turned upside down, but how he didnt really mind it since he became the well-known prince of a moderately-sized rural town known simply as bel-air. smith later decided (with the help of some producers) to recreate these amazing stories in his well-known show the fresh prince of bel-air, which first aired in 1990 and is still held dear by many patriotic americans due to the deep and meaningful message of the show. 11/10 would witness this glory with hyper-realism 4000 (tm) textures again.",55.5

"aahh.... perhaps a little too late for this games review but nevertheless. the elder scrolls series, a wonder of rpg games in the years. ive started the series with oblivion when i saw it in a cyber cafe a few years back and see all the classic table top rpg element inside it. i thoroughly enjoyed the game of course and cannnot wait for skyrim to come out, which was announced a few month after my discovery of oblivion. firstly, i was expecting its mechanism to stay but was a little disappointed in its simplicity instead. everything is too simplified and for the npcs.... the only good thing about them is their quests and nothing more, despite their somewhat colourful personalities. the role-playing this time focuses a lot on quests instead of a more broad purpose. it would seem that skyrim is made for its combat system, which was never a strong part in the elder scroll series in my opinion and is not so impressive in here either. swing, swing, occasional block and such. however, the finishing blow is admittingly the best thing to do in combat. skyrims environment however is what really makes it beautiful. to be able to explore the province of skyrim in its fullest, fast travel is almost going to be unused.... almost. all in all, it is a good adventure game despite lacking in its role-playing.",180.4

"so my original review of the majestic fifth installment of buthesduhs aaa hiking simulator series was, ing combat qtes!!!!!! which still holds true. oh well you have to deal with it i guess rite? some good things have been patched into the game like the infinite dragons can now fly backwards and also the game ctds a lot but its okay if you run 3 save + an autosave files like a bro. the game world is huge and there are 57,612 quests (yeah i counted( but there is no c&c to be had you either do quest like they say or u just leave it in your log like a quitter and quitters never win. tbh i have a lot of gripes about this game andf i wish it were a lot better than how it turned out and it is incredibly short sighted and frustrating at times but you know i still played it for over 100 hours final rating 11/10.",283.3

"at the moment of writing this i have over 86 hours played in this game and still im not even near 50% of completion. dragons, swords, bows, magic, being the chosen one in a land full of mistery, i mean, what else do you need in a game? the gameplay is perfect, the graphics are gorgeous - except for the ocassional shadow glitch, but nothing you cant fix with a mod -, and it has steam workshop for easy mod installation to make it even longer and better and prettier. each dlc is worth every single cent, because it expands the gameplay a lot, and by a lot, take my word, i mean several hours more for you to spend on this game. even though it has the bugs you can expect in a game developed by bethesda - and yes, there are lots of bugs and glitches - you dont even care because the game is so ing awesome youll not be paying attention to the bugs. and the best part is there are several unofficial and official patches in the workshop that actually fix the bugs, so just browsing the workshop for a few minutes is enough to get rid of them. a giant map, literally thousands of quests to do, skills to master, monsters to kill, books to read, dragons to slay, spells to learn, and places to explore, from dungeons to towns, a lot of replayability - believe me, you wont finish this game with only one character, you will be creating several to choose every single side possible in each conflict and making each choice you can to learn the whole story -, a magnificent lore, and the amount of mods available, make this game - along with its dlcs and expansions - one of the best games ever and a must buy, from casual to hardcore gamers.",171.1
"this game is........great...no no not great. amazing! it gives you so much to do! if its slashing things all day or smithing armour you can do it. it gives so much oppourtunity. so many dungeons, dragons, trolls, foxes, and etc. you wotn be disapponted. i like to just screw around with the guards then go on a massacure. yes, sounds crazy, well its because i am crazy!",65.4

"i was only lv 4. bow in hand, i was sneaking up on valtheim towers. the one bandit guard lazily gazed at a cliff face. i snuck closer. suddenly, the bandit yells out; im going to enjoy looting your corpse! my heart stops. have i been seen? will she cut me up? she runs away from me. before i can react, the locked doors burst open. an orc sprints out, sword in hand, and he yells; im going to enjoy counting your coin! he sprints off in the same direction as the bandit guard. i sneak up on the tower- the doors spread wide open- and peek around the corner out of curiosity. the two bandits are on one side of the river, shouting threats; on the other side, a lone rabbit, busy not caring in the slightest about whats happening. theres a third bandit, an archer, on the ridge above the rabbit. he fires arrow after arrow, missing every time. i slowly sneak into the tower, dismantling every trap and carefully checking for loot. i finally arrive on the bridge. from below, i hear a shouted threat; the rabbit is still alive- but not for long. after a solid ten minutes of being all talk, one of the bandits is finally swimming across the river to finish off the rabbit and take its phat loot. she corners the rabbit, and with a quick slice, its over. she begins swimming back to her post. i pull out my bow. with the bandit in my sights, i release an arrow. this is for the bunny... i whisper. in slow motion, the arrow arcs majestically through the air towards the bandit. boom, right in the heart. in the middle of the river. her body floats over a waterfall. 10/10 goty",52.4
"i feel the biggest problem with this game is that the primary gameplay feature is exploration, except the world levels up as your character does. this includes the loot that you find as you adventure, so there are very few opportunities to find something interesting as you explore. there are a few locations that yield neat gear, like the daedric shrines, but overall i find that this is one of the biggest problems with this type of rpg lately: you will always be fighting something your level and they will always drop something level appropriate. this mechanic dissolves the feeling of tension that should be part of exploring the unknown. the story arc also ramps up to epic levels too quickly, denying any feeling of having earned any prestige. i prefer the slow burn of something like morrowind, where your humble beginnings provide context for your climb to becoming a mythical figure. i also find that there is too little diversity in the types of spells you can cast, and the melee mechanics. for a game that deals so much with swordplay, the melee feels vague and the crash of combat lacks any sense of feedback. the ragdoll physics also feel weightless; bodys are merely hollow forms with no mass that sail through the air before sliding down the rugged landscape like greased sleds. these issues often turn a serious high fantasy adventure into an unintentional comedy. im not saying that this is a bad game by any means, in fact i strongly recommend it. however, when i compare the story arc and game mechanics to something like fallout 3, i feel like alot of the intelligence and pacing was replaced with instant gratification so the game would better appeal to the average joe. in closing, comparing skyrim to morrowind feels like comparing dragon age: origins to baldurs gate 2. one is visually superior, but all of that visual polish can not make up for removing the features and stoytelling that provide so much richness to the experience.",184.2
"best rpg ever!!! but seriously, the story line is really good no mather what people say to try and make it sound typical but really its unique and immersive, with so much side quests that",180.2
