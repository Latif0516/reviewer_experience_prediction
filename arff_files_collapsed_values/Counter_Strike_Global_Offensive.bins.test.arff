"so much mlg in my screen, awps everywhere, such good. 9/10 its ok.",1
"wonderful source of smurfs and douches that we all love. 10/10.",3
"opens case, wants asiimov, gets bizon, praise gaben. 5 stars.",4
"this game will make you cry because of the damn 64 tickrate. it will make you throw the object next to your left hand out of the window. it will make you laugh because your friend will get 360 noscoped by a teammate. but whatever happens, you will come back. you will pwn people, dominate them, and get the most beloved global elite rank. you will comprehend the euphoric feelings when you get the next rank. unless youre a skrub. in that case just uninstall.",2
"play game on bad computer until you are silver 1 get better computer and install game cry because you havent gotten any better win some matches still silver 1 get an ace always silver 1 get laughed at because you are silver 1 10/10 would be silver 1 again",1
"absolutely frustrating aiming mechanics . gg will play again for reasons i dont understand.",2
"this game is most likely going to be one of your favourite. the competitve mode is the most popular and it includes a range of other modes, such as casual and offline/online with bots. if u are looing for a fun game to play alone or with your friends i would suggest this one to be on your wishlist. 5/5",3
"more realistic gameplay than other fps game, better graphic and gameplay than previous one...",1
"awesome so add me to play cs:go with me and my other friends and you need to buy it! when not you are stupid ! .....",1
"the day i make it to global elite is the day i stop playing cs:go forever. in other words, im stuck with this . #rekt.",10
"very fun too play enjoy it everytime what more should i ask for? well first more camos!!!!",3
"fundamentally a great fps game. the classic maps from source and 1.6 are still here, and have been nicely updated to look fantastic. competitive 5vs5 mode is very popular, and although there are issues with match-making and hackers, there is now retrospective rank editing, so if a game youre in contains a hacker, who is then banned, that loss will be wiped from your record and your rank will return! casual game modes are still fun, and there are a few great casual maps to play. one thing casual mode is lacking in a 5vs5 competitive practise mode, as currently its 10vs10 which is just chaos at times. apart from these flaws and the difficulty of the game itself which can be off-putting to newcomers, i would still massively recommend this game.",8
"counter-strike global offensive is an awesome game for its money, since its a 10 euro game, i didnt expect such an awesome, living and good working community and game! esspecially the competive part and the trading is awesome!",2
"terrible at everything but competitive. game gets me hard. big ups from your boy wonder-mike. 10/10",2
"do not get this game if you do not work as a team, be tactical, and have a strategical mindset. this game is not for the average call of duty player. though, if you want to have fun and be in a competitive scene with your friends, this game is right for you. also on a side note, dont play a mm game if you dont have at least an hour of free time.",7
"this game was a 4/10 untill i discovered the chickens.. i gave it 6/10 because i like the chickens.. i played on inferno and i met more chickens, now i rate it 8/10",1
"the enjoyment of the game comes from being able to many things that are not accesible in other fps and strategy games. counter strike global offensive is one of my personel favorties becaus eof the amazing fps action and the strategy behind the plan of attack. there is a lack to the game though, but it shouldnt affect how you play. the competitive matchmaking, the people who play competitive arent always what youd expect in sych an amazing game but those types of people are always going to be there.",3
"if you start playing this game you will start speaking russian fluently in 2 weeks.(guaranteed)",1
"i love this game, but watch out because it is a very bad game when it comes to spending money on the game after you already own it to buy the skins you want!",3
"youll get so addicted to the competive ladder system.",4
"a game about killing chickens! how could you not like it?",4
"life in a competitive match your team: you f*cking suck d*ck c*ck mother f*cker!!!!! you: but im trying as hard as i can the one nice person on your team: then try harder and we can win this the rest of your team: shut the f*ck up! (to the one nice person) you: can i be kicked now? your team: no you deserve a ban if your abandoning us!!!! 69/1 would buy. but be prepared to be anally , mentally, and physically.",1
"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",7
"really good game focusing mostly around competitive gameplay, if you are a try-hard like me then its a must have!",2
"very simply, this game is rewarding in the best of ways. losing is simply a lesson on new tactics to employ in future games. winning is glorious and hard fought almost every time.",4
"i play many games but, this is one i keep coming back to. it has by far the most hours i have in a game, and the time i have put into this game is well worth it. its a must buy to anyone who want to play a real game.",5
"it may lack some of the community niceties, beloved maps (assault, anyone?), and little features of past games, but global offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking counter-strike for whoever wants it. even if the community doesnt meet the golden standard of 1.6 and source, cs:go will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.",1
"ignorant game beacause cheaters are everywhere! in every match there is at least one cheater. i enjoyed playing it with my friends, but now the game is lame. until valve do something about this i do not recomend this game.",5
"i have had this game for the last 5 to 6 months since school started back in august, since then i have gained around 1300 hours or so and i very much love the game, i just got my first knife and personally love how the game works, i am very competitive, so this is right down my path...",9
"i love counter strike i just spend alot of money for the crates....",7
"darth vader and the empire are building a new, indestructible death star. meanwhile, han solo has been imprisoned, and luke skywalker has sent r2-d2 and c-3po to try and free him. princess leia - disguised as a bounty hunter - and chewbacca go along as well. the final battle takes place on the moon of endor, with its natural inhabitants, the ewoks, lending a hand to the rebels. will darth vader and the dark side overcome the rebels and take over the universe? review paid for by: monsanto",1
"if youre a fan of call of duty, buy the new ones at release, fanboy over it, then you should go out to gamestop and trade in every single one of those games and pick up a quality fps. this one. plus killing a chicken in deathmatch gets you +1 point. 10/10",3
"this is like the best game out there, you get the thrill of playing the game, its so much fun while playing with your friends. making your own team and going against other team, its hell of fun. if you really like fps games, and your in a challenge i would say buy it now, one of the best games i had on steam.",1
"best fu***** game ever. like 10 new weps in game. new scopes. only thing what is bad is recoil and too much noobs! :ppppppp",4
"extreme addictive game that i recommend to everyone! that has so far impressed with counter strike games, then they will really like it, because this game is superior to its predecessors. great job, hidden path, valve!",1
"one of the best games and recommend this in sale and in normal price.",3
"great game, love to play it all the time, my parents have an issue with how much im playing this! haha",7
"although not as good as the original counter-strike, in certain respects the game makes various improvements such as the additions of molotovs, matchmaking, skins and other general improvements like the ui. many aspects of the core gameplay has been altered resulting in a lower skill ceiling than previous generations of counter-strike however cs go still remains a competitive fps to this day with decent tournament support.",10
"extremely smart fps, and it is extremely nice to see a game that doesnt have the usual call of duty game-play. ton of achievements, steam workshop accessibility, and hours of unique fun to be had.",1
"you will spend a ridiculous amount of money on this game if you get addicted.",6
"if youre able to learn game mechanics and better yourself in them instead of whining about how you aimed at this guys head and probably hit him like 20 times on your screen while you were actually spraying n praying, not hitting . then this game is for you. the matchmaking is something new, it sure is a thing that a lot of people will hate if they live in zimbabwe or some other  like that. the  strike; global onion rings can be pretty a pretty enjoyable expirience for the whole family, that is if your mom and dad can rush b while your dumb sister carries the bomb, while you turn on aim hack just to ruin the fun for everyone else.",3
"this is a really great game, you can chose to play bomb defusal, hostage rescue, arms race, and other game modes. enjoyable game, but more enjoyable when playing with freinds.",1
"i really enjoy cs go it is one of my favorite games i love unlike the xbox 360 version you can get cool weapon skins and diffrent kinds of knives you can open cases i really recommend this game to everybody",2
"the greatest point-and-click adventure game of our generation.",5
"pretty fun if you dont end up with a bunch of raging babies screaming in their mics..",6
"ing awesome game. even on a low end laptop i am able to get around 30 fps stable. reccomend to anyone looking for a great fps that requires a great amount of skill.",4
"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",7
"if you love tennis or ping pong. this is not a game for you -kappa 1337-2015",3
"very cool game, enjoy playing it 2 years from now. hope they will fix some glitches",4
"100 hours. my inventory is worth more than $75. good game, good game",2
"1. join competitive match 2. server goes down 3. the only options available in the main menu are reconnect (which obviously doesnt work) and abandon 4. choose abandon 5. 2 hour ban 6. ??? 7. valve profit",2
"i dont usually always get flash banged, but when i do its because i threw it. it is highly recommended by gabe to buy a pair of $300 headset so you can listen to who bang your mother every night in high quality. this game should be awarded game of the year every year.",3
"i am addicted. time to die a sad lonely gun filled life.",2
"best pc fps in my opinion. it seems like a small investment for such an amazing game, but the skins man. the skinz.",3
"you can rekk cod-kids while they call you hacker 10/10",6
"men in spendex in a tight spot with tight weapons.. what more to say?",2
"if you like 1.6, you will like this game, pretty addictive game, more fun with skins. recommended.",8
"superbly awesome for close quarter shooter game like the uncommon counter strike global offensive that brings the old times back to life with the new gamemodes and weapon finishes. but bad matchmaking, sometimes it doesnt think about your ping and you cant choose a server",3
"awesome game; definitely broken in some ways, but nothing earth shattering...fun game to play casually or seriously on a team.",4
"great game, ban system is a pile of large heaping horse ...",1
"russians and 12 year olds, like cod but better. 11/10",3
"this game is so ing analy epic that id suck its  day and night. for a few weeks. good game, recommend that anal. i got tired of fapping it though, so i will have too stop soon. #mydahlbergrbrutalfetmsteavlivasinom5minutermedenskedellerom1timmemedensaxhl",3
"getting called a hacker is the best compliment you can get in this game",2
"great game. it stands out from every other fps, i cannot believe i could get this much entertainment for 13 euro. 9/10",3
"alright, so if you want a game that is fun to play, gives you chances to win, evolve and actually be skilled at it in some time, but withouth making you angry, then dont buy this game. basically, this is just an updated version of the previous titles, but with a marketplace that will give you weapons with camos and weapon cases if you are the best in the round. the big problem with this game is the matchmaking, which is idiot. in my 1st game i got in a matchmaking with a 5 year vet on the nemy team. also, for people who wnat to learn russian, this is the best no teacher learn russian software ever.",1
"graphics wtf dont buy this, buy bf4 w/good graphics you ing console ridden hipsters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",3
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",1
"ummm its a good way to get steam funds if ur broke like u can get 6 pennies every week its like hitting the jackpot",2
"its a good follow up to the classic counter-strike 1.6. game feels good and have been improved together with the professional teams. the only downside is that you cannot choose region or language and some problems occur as follows. russians mostly are matched up with english speaking players, and they have overall bad english or no english at all. the valve servers currently run at 64tickrates/second wich makes the competitive match making abit luck based sometimes. cdkeys are very cheap in russia and this is a problem when many players abuse it to cheat with a n account. skins on weapons and knifes are really good and brings some trading into it wich makes the community flourish around this aspect aswell.",6
"my favorite fps game ever!! because csgo is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. it has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come. in short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. its been around for years and has spawned many imitators.",1
"counter strike: global offensive is an absolutely essential multiplayer experience. the gameplay has been refined to near perfection. the gun play is unparalleled and the complexity of this games competitive mode is staggering given how simple the games premise is. throw on top all of this a compelling market place where people earn, buy, sell and trade unique skins, stickers, keys and the like and you have got a recipe for pure addiction. i give counter strike: global offensive my highest praises and i hope to see future iterations continue the level of dedication and quality that is present in this online delight.",1
"absolutely terrific game! you can play against players who use weapons such as the awp, the awp, the awp, a guy with bizon and the awp! best game evah!",2
"gamers logic: if you cant beat them call them a hacker :d",6
"best fps i ever have played excels as a team based competive game and is at its best in those clutch situtions were its you a terrorist and bomb thats tocking down",6
"this is a very fun game. if you enjoy competative, strategic, and untimately time consuming games, play this!",3
"if you like to be a tactical badass then this is a game for you its just a fun game lots of content and its not a pay to win game 100/10 best game ever!",2
"best game i ever played, but still to much cheaters and its to cheap.",1
"russian logic in cs:go. - okay guys, go eco. * russian guy buys an awp without armor and no grenades - okay, go a long. - ! *russian guy shoots teammate in the face with a deagle and runs b alone with bomb.* 8/8 gr8 exprerience",9
"if you want to feel like a nub at a game, even after 500 hours, then i recommend csgo",1
"i played a counter-strike game in my life first time this week. even thought i dont play fps games on pc it is not hard to play.",7
"awesome game. more fun if youve got a m9 or some m9s to play with while on skype.",1
"*just gets unbanned after 7 days* *joins game* *four russians kick you* another 7 days of being banned.",3
"very fun and very balanced game. easy to start off after you learn the basics because of great weapon balance",1
"cs:go is like an amazing song you can play it many times in a row but if you play it too many times you get tired of it",4
"i used to play tf2 a lot so im used to playing a game where i buy a bunch of usless in game items 10/10",2
"great game !! cant stop playin it ... learned some russian btw ! :p",3
"a must not miss game of the best franchise in the history of fps (pc).",3
"brilliant game, i have played counter strike for many months now and all i can say is it is truely amazing. you can have endless fun playing both tactically in competitive matches, or for some general fun and banter in casual, deathmatch or arms race. would thoroughly recomend the purchase of counter-strike: global offensive",3
"great game, combines everything what is needed in an fps shooter. it is still the same game that came out years ago, but now it is spiced up! i highly recommend it for everyone. ( the co-op games with friends are the best.)",1
"the rage in competive matches ruins friendships.... 10/10 would rage again",5
"this game. exploding chickens have never been any more satisfying. i personally havent played this for too long, which means im not too experienced. but so far, this is a really great game, and its incredibly fun for being such an old game. id say this is a very competitive game, its very multiplayer focused and incredibly fun. most of the matches you go in you get to meet new people, and very nice people as well (this doesnt go for everyone). the game has really funny weapon mechanics, where you need quite a lot of skill to use the weapons. this makes the game a lot more fun, where players cant just run and spray, which makes the game harder, but also a lot funnier in many aspects. remember this game is hard! dont buy it unless youre ready to put in some good time into it. have a good one! - drunk unicorn",2
"well, this game has some pluses & minuses im going to mention below: pluses: + very competitive & challenging online game for shooter lovers; + big variety of weapons; + got lots of weapon skins which you can trade/sell; + additional missions which gives you rewards after completion; minuses: - only few weapons have aiming/zooming availability; - damage system is bad (you can empty whole magazine to an opponent on the chest & he still may stay alive); - graphics aint that good for 2012; - very strict rules in competitive mode (especially leaving the match penalty. it gonna give you cooldown even if you get disconnected from the game due to error & you cant fix it in 3 minutes. cooldowns may be from 30 minutes to 7 days); all in all, i dont see other alternatives of this game in this genre & despite all its minuses i mentioned above, it still remains one of the most played game in my list.",4
"no better way to waste time and get camos while you can still get money from market items so yeah its pretty good!!!",1
"this game is fun, adictive, and nerve racking! as well as those, there is a market for gun camos. what more could you want?",1
"love this game! i have had so much fun with it lately!",7
"its a fun and cooperative game. in this game you will be needing teamwork and cooperation with your team throughout the game",2
"good old-school fps fun. steep learning curve if used to cod style fps",1
"shoot the chickens, then all your money will refunds.",1
"this is the greatest fps game ever made. you can earn money by playing. you earn amazing skill and knowledge that i cant see in other games. buy it and try now. the engine of the game is great. you also have automatic built-in multiplayer system. awesome!",2
"this game is worth the money everyone should buy it",5
"i shoot at people. then they were dead. and they paid me 300 for each kill. 10/10",3
"i shoot bullets at a person, and they die from it. sometimes they do not. sometimes they shoot me. very deep storytelling.",5
"i think this game is pretty awesome. i enjoyed it a lot.",1
"if there was a time to get good, this would be it.",1
"a wonderful game for a low price (summersale rocks).",2
"it is enough to say: this is counter strike. one of my top 3 games.",6
"really great game to play with friends. would reccomend it to almost anyone, although its a hard game to just pick up and play. practice makes perfect. i also reccomend that you use a custom crosshair and watch some tutorials on recoil control etc.",10
"the fact that i am writing a review to convince anyone on the fence about this game is disconcerting. this is hands down my all-time favorite tactical shooter. there is little negative to say about this game besides the players who abuse it from time to time. the addition of overwatch and use of vac help to limit this, however. the competitive element about this game keeps me constantly on my toes and at the edge of my seat. the active developers address any bugs or issues with the game in a very timely manner. the inclusion of item drops have reinvigorated the game for myself as well, personalization=power. the use of the steam workshop for custom maps is also a plus for training or general enjoyment. only complaint is there are no scripted building destruction animations and that michael bay wasnt considered for explosions and boom effects. :)",7
"this game is the best to meet some new eastern european people, they are always very kind to you and are always shouting nice things to you on the voice chat. also your teammates are always carrying you. oh ramklov and kael suck at this game. r8 8/8 m8",3
"very good game it fun and addictive,great online community with many severs to choose from and also there is now a huge selection of weapons to choose from making it a great improvement on its predecessors",1
"filled with wannabee mlg pro players play source instead",1
"counter strike globally offensive is an excellent game overall. the dynamics of the game make fun and interesting for a long lasting time. i have played this game for almost 500 hours and i assure you i will continue playing because there are endless oppertunites of things you can do in this game including competitve, casual, deathmatch, arms race, and the workshop. also you can get skins for your weapons which adds a personality factor to the game and their are multiple ways to get skins you can buy a key and case; and unlock the case with the key; but when you do that you have random chances of geting an asortment of skins. the grand prize however is a knife which can be worth alot of irl money. so overall i would give this game a 10 out of 10 in my opinion",4
"i love all counter-stirkes, this one is pretty good. personaly there are so many mechanical flaws that desrupt the whole game all together. this game can become rage inducing to certain extents. one notable flaw is the poor lag compensation and certain match making glitches for competitive mode. for the past 2 weeks, this game has been brutal with high pings on every single server i join. im getting banned for weeks just for having a poweroutage; some teamates accidentally either walk infront of you fireing a weapon a few times or walking into a he grenade; and you get a ban/kick for their own fault. i enjoy this game at very few times, but not enough to be worth what it is. i regret buying this game.",3
"good game always developing new maps and experiences to keep the game running. small changes in maps new opreations make the game intresting all the time.",4
"unless you enjoy being banned for 7 days for having connection problems, or because your team is full of idiots who cant fathom, that if you dont use shift or crouch, then yes, everyone in the damn game will hear you running around like a bloody rhino, then i advise you not to get this game.",3
"if youre into first person shooters, and especially competitive ones, you have got to have this game in your library !",2
"great game... except if ur listed with russians in comp....",4
"been playing cs since 2004. do i need to explain more??",2
"i highly recommend this game to anyone who loves first person shooters, but i will say this if u have not played any counter strike before it is offensive for begining players that can change if u play often and get used to it. anyways i love this game i hope yall do to",1
"this game made me realize that i am not the only russian playing it on steam, and i found out just exactly how many kids, that my mother slept with!",1
"pew pew pew. bang bang bang. counter terrorists win.",4
"some guy was talking about how he had all kinds of cancers and he wanted donations. he was a funny sarcastic guy. i tried to friend him. he didnt accept. 10/10",1
"i love this game. i was obsessed with competitive tf2 before i got this game, and when i bought it i transitioned into it quite well. the competitive nature of the community and intense gameplay are giant pluses to me. one problem i found though, if you get quite into the game and learn the gun mechanics by muscle memory, it is extremely difficult to play other shooters without pulling your gun down after a second, or jumping and crouching to shoot someone. i guess that would be good though, as it shows its uniqueness and memorability. game was definitely worth my $15.",2
"my life was in shambles. my wife had left me. my parents casted me out of my house. my kids starving and begging for food. then i found counterstrike. the game ran so smooth on my  computer. a supreme race of next gen gaming for such a outdated pc. with the simple press to speak mic keys i wouldnt have to hear my loud  ing kids beg me for more food. i could hear only what i wanted to hear. i think theyre dead now but that just means more time for counterstrike. its truly a game for the gods. overall i give it a 8/10",1
"great game. recent update has ruined some aspects of the game - allowing it to be more commercial than its supposed to be. but it is still fun and entertaining. #1.5livesonthroughme",4
"great game. it wouldve been better if there were no cheaters at all.. or at least a good anti-cheat system.. but volvo is volvo, and gaben is gaben.. ya kno what im sayin bro?",8
"fantastic game (once you get into it) with a very steep learning curb. i have put in almost 100 hours, but i am still not very good yet.",2
"this game is.....well....interesting place... this is the place where you die as a noob. this is the place where you play as hacker. this is a place where every kill you make...is lucky. this is a place where skill means how mouch knives and awp skins you got. this is a place where nobody speaks english. this is a place where your fps means how good are you. and lastly...this is a place...where everybody is gay and want you to suck their sausage. yes. this is that kind of place. otherwise game is good, stylish, fun and sometimes makes your heart skip a beat. too bad that community is pretty screwed up thanks to little ones.",2
"counter-strike, the fps series that will ruin your ability to do life, but kill srubs and enjoy teamwork based gamemodes without having to hear children b***h about things. best of all you dont have to buy a new one every two or so years, or have to deal with origin. what more could you possibly want? answer: camos, lots and lots of camos! 89.50/100",3
"the most balanced and competitive shooter out there right now, with one of the best dev teams behind it. cs go is everything i wanted 1.6 to be years ago, and nearly 500 hours in im not bored of it yet.",5
"this game is so awesome! you will never stop playing it, it worths the price! recommend it to everyone!",3
"so, you play a competitive/casual/community game, and get drops. those drops usually consist of cases. once you open them, you waste $2.50 of your money for a $0.01 skin. also, you trade and trade, and get a really valuable item. and you get scammed/hacked and lose it, and steam wont refund it no matter how long you go on. also, russians are ing annoying. also, matchmaking is  also, everything costs money in this game also, its hard to master the recoil if your a noob. (for some reason steam blocks s c r u b now) 10/10.",3
"a very nicely made counter strike, best version yet.",10
"great game, they really did a great job bringing forward the competetive play in this game. this game offers a perfect balance between either casual play or competetive play.",3
"its a good game, definitely a big step up from css which blew giant  compared to 1.6. the only complaint i have with this game is that once you get to badge or higher, the amount of blatant and toggling hackers that you see in matchmaking is ludicrously high and makes you not want to play. the system itself which tries to balance the teams usually fails miserably too, but thats nothing new in valve games, as evidenced by dota 2s horrendous matchmaking. decent game overall, has some glaring issues though like completely ineffective anti-cheat.",10
"i dont actually own this game; no idea why theyd let me review it. 11/10",1
"this game is very fun and addicting. it makes you wanna play match after match. i like the realistic damage of the weapons as well. i also think the addition of weapon camos is great, and it adds a social aspect, trading. i recommend this game, but not for people who enjoy call of dutys fast-paced combat and killstreaks. this game is much more strategically based.",2
"this game is a nice tactical shooter. meta-game is really big. it takes a long time to get into if youve never played a cs type game before, but its pretty fun once you get to the ~30 hour mark and start playing competetive. you have to be pretty rich to afford this game in the long run though because of all the broken keyboards when playing matchmaking with randoms, and opening cases will drain your paypal account faster than you can say stattrak butterfly knife | fade.",6
"not for cod-like players. really good game. nuff said.",6
"got highest score by shooting at chickens only. 10/10 would sacrifice more chickens again.",1
"this is an awesome multiplayer game i recommend this game for who ever loves a stratergy and fps game in one",3
"this is my story , it began when im playing competitive our score is 14-7 were really losing but suddenly my friend said allahu akbar and after he said that our team said allahu akbar too and then after that we always win the round so the score is 16-14 10/10 would play again",2
"you have spent approximately $1,677.36 usd in the game after this card set was released. case opening. gg",10
"so, where do i start? first of all its the most developed valve game ive ever seen in terms of community. along with great competitive servers there are casual ones for people who like the gam, but dont have time for a match or just want fun. then theres the ol modded servers like surf and bhop, etc. finally this is all i have to say actual tactical army skins= thumbs down. crazy as  looking skins that have a damn dragon on them and is orange=thumbs up. good night/morning/evening.",1
"great game, it looks far more better than any other counter-strike game.",6
"one of the best e-sport games of the decade. a must have in ones library.",8
"this game is awesome online works great and i love competative mode you should play it if you like a good fps",5
"learned russian very fast ! this is a good textbook!",1
"a seriously addictive tactical shooter that relives the good old days of cs:s with advanced graphics, maps, guns, and skins.",1
"this is the best strategy game ive ever played! i recommend this for everyone that likes fps games! (better than cod, kids)",5
"just awesome. i played the game when it came out i have to be honest, the game was really bad. but then with the continuous developement by valve the game started to get something interesting. i come from 1.6 and i hated this game, now i love it. recommend it 5/5.",4
"this is one game that you must have in your library!",2
"i find it kind of weird, but i love shotting people...",2
"very good game, good fps, lots of variety in weapons and how to customise, i would like to see weapon attachments and zooming in for all weapons, i like the game modes and that way that game is made to be medium to fast pace",4
"its a fun game. playing competitive is really fun, but theres plenty of other stuff if thats not your cup of tea. they also have workshop support, so you can play maps with custom rule sets and different layouts. id recommend this game to anyone. its not too expensive, and is boundless fun. 9/10",2
">see a guy >shoot him >miss every shot >he turns around >kills me in one shot >exit cs:go 10/10",2
"this is one of best games ive ever had the pleasure to play. the maps and the weapons are simply stunning and the gamemodes are awfully addictive. the newly improved cs is very impressing, the layout for menus are simple, sweat and easy to navigate. my favourite part of the game has to be competitive as you can rank up depending on how well you play, the higher your rank, the better players you play against. valve made this game fair and fun for all age groups. i fairly do suggest you buy this game as well as a few skins to impress your friends and the general public.",1
"fun sometimes in a short period but the ranking system sucks. get matched up with new/crappy players who doesnt know english or cant play any good = never get a rank up, and they keep teamkilling you /flashing/hurting you/blaming you even if they dont listen to the team and makes the team loose, then you kick them but when you kick them you get a 7 day ban...great job valve. at higher ranks you often meet aimhackers/wallhackers...takes some time before they get ban and if you leave game you cant the get a 30min ban/7 day ban or longer. would not recommend this game to anyone unless you are good or have around 10-200 friends who is playing it regularly. never ever open any type of case/capsule you will get a 5 cent skin.",3
"i highly recommend this game. if you liked cs and/or css, youll love cs go like crazy. :) and if you didnt like the old games, youll love this one anyway. its the most exciting and well made counter strike game so far. with incredible graphics and awesome maps, this game is, in my opinion, the best multiplayer game ever.",1
"recommended this game to my friend at school. he bought it. 1 week later, first rank silver 2, now its been almost 2 years and over 1,600 hours and silver elite. i played with him often and when i did, i deranked. he had a knife worth around 78 got scammed on it. now back to ak47 cartel stattrak. 10/10 would either play mm with russians",4
"great game, fun gun play, great competitive matchmaking, awesome skins and much more. you need to get your hands on this game.",6
"counter-strike always be my number 1 because its my childhood game when i was kid im always play counter and counter and counter just have 1 bad thing in go desert eagle .. the old counter strikes 1.6 or 1.5 you can get desert for round and easly get kills with desert every round but in here desert is really need carefull shoots because its so much recoil .. but still counter-strike is my number 1 !!",10
"i like it :d its a counter strike game whats not to expect?",6
"this game is for everyone, great for meeting new people and calling people hackers because they kill you xd. if you buy this game you will get hours of endless fun with friends and other people.",2

"this game has ruined my life. its fun with the competitive mode you kinda feel like youre in a tournament. and the deathmatch mode is a good warmup. this game has weapon skins like tf2 but the hats are weapon skins. all-in-all the game is amazing compared to the older games 10.5/10",4
"nice game... skins, key, cases, ranks... i have 500h and i can say is a nice game ( with his hitbox errors and 128 tick )",5
"i have played counter-strike when it first came out for the pc and have played it through the most current version of today(2013). i am glad to say without a doubt that it has not lost any aspect that has made this one of my favorite shooters by far to play and has not lost any of its multiplayer value. i hope to continue to see this growth and look forward to seeing new titles in the future.",1
"its a good game. its much harder to pick up than any other shooter because of its mechanics. this isnt really a bad thing, as youll get used to it eventually and it makes it even more fun to get kills (especially headshots) because of its difficulty. the community in this game isnt really the best, as most of the players playing in competetive are people who wont cooperate and russians. this makes it really heard to communicate with your team you might have been matched with in the competetive gamemode. so having somebody you know to play competetive with is much better and easier as teamwork is necessary for winning this game. other than that i must say that most weapons here are very well balanced because of how the money system works. if i would have the option to change one thing in this game it would be to make competetive (or just generally all valve servers) 128 tick, as it would make the game more based on how well you play and less on whos the most lucky in a gunfight.",9
"superb game.!! tests your skills for concentration power and reaction time!!! the added skins and tasks make it that much more competitive to fight hard to earn it!!!! hats off to the developers of cs:go as well as contributors who helped increase the variety of skins and maps!!! keep it up!!",4

"csgo was suprising people like no way theres an new counter strike!!! l wanted to have it soo bad the graphichs are amazing the new throwables and the new weapons! but now to the downside...valve has maked this game with crates and stuff and since that l didnt play it too much then from an fps shooter to an skill simulator but without that this would be favorable.",1
"this is an excellent fps for anyone who enjoys serious gaming. however, the random bans could be fixed, considering i had not even played a game and got a random 6 hour ban",3
"you shoot many dude, beware of brazil. also good to collect shiny gun for virtual dosh",4
"much better than cross fire. definitely recommend :x",2
"this game is very fun and addictive. it also supports my gambling addiction by dropping cases which cost ing 2.50 dollars to open, only to get a gun that is worth 50 cents. 7/10 is my finnal score overall i would reccomend if you can handle not waisting away 30 dollars on the community market. the game would of been better without items.",3
"i just run around with a auto in warm up and kill everyone. 10/10",4
"single player campaign is too short and multiplayer is too hard.",7

"be patient and lord gaben will drop you some cool stuff! thx gaben!",3
"counter strike global offensive is a beautiful addition to the counter strike series it being the forth one to be made i believe valve have done a wonderful job but this isnt why im giving this game 10/10 its because you can also kill chickens for points in deathmatch 10/10 :d by far my favourite game in the series",7
"this game ing sucks, all p2w. if you want a game that is free and doesnt cost anything play something like dota 2 or skyrim.",1
"seriously, this game is for the trollers! 2 feuteses were buggin us and then we get kicked for some . we only liek did some stuffs to them but that dont matter here now., be less !",2
"game is either too easy against bots or to hard against internet. the matchmaking is a lie...so is the cake...sob...",2
"really good and funny game. the best thing is the rank system. skins. skins. ez skins ez life",3
"after cs:s valve did a great job with cs:go but you need a good pc to play this game on 30fps+ i recommend.",2
"better that game and incredible teamplay game!!! go go go! must have! :d",8
"dont play that game... :c not good for your wallet. :d",10
"amazing game i would recommend it to anyone who loves shooters + molotovs bounce off walls amazing logic its like they are made out of rubber ;p",2
"dont play it without 2 bags of dorritos, 2 bottles of mtn dew. while retaking bombsites be faster than sanic.",3
"i recommend this game to anyone that is willing to start really bad and rarely ever get kills because eventually you will do very good if you watch videos on call outs certain smoke spots flash spots and common spots to aim for if you dont mind playing a lot of csgo then this game is for you",6
"one of the greatest pc games ivbe played in a while totally worth $15.00 and though it might be a really tough game to play its still very fun i recommend this game to all pc gamers.",1

"a good game, but still needs some work done on anti-cheating",7

"definately a bang for your buck. although waitout until the game comes on sale again. be patient, its not going anywhere.",3
"this game is ing fun, only downside most of the people play this game, have never played a cs game before and they run around like a bunch of chickens witouth heads, but the gunplay the tickrate is amazing, one of the best fps games i have ever played. 10/10",1
"you will play and get better, then you will get annoyed at all who arent good... then you will buy keys to get skins and lose lots of money. overall you will have fun. cs:go 2014",3

"you will play this game all day long, but you will never be good! you will break your keyboard, mouse and headset in rage, but you will bever be good! your fingers will bleed, but still you will never be good you will lose your job, fail your exams and your family will leave you, but still it will all be in vain you will never be good! but after 1932819hours you will finally get to silver 2 and you will be proud!",2
"theres only 3 things players are called, noobs, hackers, and dumbasses. and everyone i mean everyone, is called noob hackers and dumbasses",2
"i played this game like 80 hours i think, and my perspective on this game was... hmm, ok, it is the old engine of cs, and all the mechanics are almost the same, except that the shooting part its much more harder then the cs 1.6, for example. the visuals in their base line are pretty much the same, but you know they look much more gooder then the old ones. the community varies from guy to guy, i mean, you should expect everything, and when i say everything, its everything, some weird folks down there, but you know, they have their role, making you laugh sometimes. another aspect that i liked was the menu, every knid of menu, pretty clever the buy menu, it looks awesome, the start menu, it is very good structured and it left me a very good perspective on it. so, i must say that this game it is not a waste of money, you should buy it.",2
"i have played counter-strike in all its incarnations, on and off, since it was first released 15 years ago. no other first person shooter has ever been as enjoyable for me to play. i enjoy the perfect balance between strategy and reflexes, unlike other first person shooters which i feel go too far in one direction or the other. i cannot recommend this game highly enough, if you are a fan of the fps genre of computer games, or a fan of good computer games in general.",1
"basically, if you are silver i but own a stattrak knife, you are a pro.",4
"it was fun about an year ago, now its just a piece of  ! its all about the ing skins! a game full of hackers, noobs, crying kinds, smurfs, and guys playing just to ruin their teammates game ! gj valve rip csgo 2012-2015... ps. my first negative review and its for my favoirite game!",8
"been playing the counter strike series by valve for about 10 years now, pretty great series imo. definitely better than call of doodoo, halo and battlefield 10/10 would buy.",6
"before i played counter strike global offensive i was a source player, and i didnt really like it i just played it cuz thats only what my friend plays, then csgo came i didnt wanna buy it. but then it was on sale and i tought to my self i could atleast try it i did. i regret that i didnt buy it earlier, this game is amazing. the only bad thing about it is those damn trolls... the first thing they do when i join a competetive match is kicking me leaving me with a 7 day cooldown, i really hope more people reported these kind of people so we can get rid of them, anyway, one of the best games i ever played you should buy it, its so amazing",4
"its a pretty fun game. you just have to learn how to play it first. you cant play it like cod or bf and just run n gun most of the time since you only have 1 life in most gamemodes. most fun youll every have in this game is playing competetive with some friends and even when you suck you have fun doing it. also micro transactions make the gaming world go round.",3
"great game so far! the community on the australian servers are edgy 12-16 year olds though, make sure you have voice chat disabled in public games to fully enjoy cs:go. i would also like to thank bobbybana for giving me this game.",1
"first the good review: - its cs 10/10 - the weapons sistem is nothing like the others cs, you can gain the skin weapons by playing or opening boxes or buying them on the market, and thats very cool. now the bad review, and this one makes me so angry: - the competitive: 1 - the team, if can find those noob teams that kill their own partners or just be afk the whole game! 2 - the competitve cooldown, now this one its just annoying and overwhelming stupid, because you get kicked by leaving the game and thats fine but imagine that your net goes down or our pc was turn off because of some lightning, you will get that same kick and you cant to nothing about it and thats makes me so angry because you get 7 days of penalty because you net was down and thats not fair. hope that this will help someone!",3
"playing this game requires teamwork endurance and skill. my friends and i play it. then i died to someguy named pansysandponies and i punched my computer 10/10 best game ever",3
"cooldown simulator 2015 spends 2 weeks trying to rank up team runs into molotov, 7 day ban comes back from ban, finally ranks up first game as new rank, instantly kicked for not being russian by premade russians 7 day cooldown for being kicked too many times instant derank 11/10 would smash keyboard again",3
"as a former big time call of duty player/streamer i found this game very easy. the players that occupy this game dont even come close to the skill level required to frag a game like cod at a competitive level. if youve played cod at a semi-competitive level, i would highly recommend this game. youll get easy frags and there are plenty of lulz to be had from the butthurt kids thatll rage at you over the in-game voip.",3
"join a game, 3 kills with awp in a row and suddenly youre a hacker. love it",5
"you will find this game very hard after you play games like battlefield and/or call of duty. if you are a competitive player this game is right for you. this game requires you to to communicate with your team in order for your team to win the round.",1
"buy the p250 on pistol round, buy ak47 or m4a1-s second round, buy awp 3rd round -dies- then repeat this process.",3
"counter strike global offensive has a perfect mix of casual and competetive gaming. if you are just starting out on the game you can play modes such as deathmatch, demolition and arms race before jumping in to competetive. competetive is the perfect way to prove yourself as a good player as you will be placed in to games based on your competetive rank which is good for new-comers to the game. i personally enjoy the competetive aspect of the game over casual although i have noticed a few faults with in the matchmaking system. sometimes somebody who is a low level gold (such as myself) you are sometimes placed in to a game with the top level golds or sometimes even master guardians. this could be because the mgs are playing with their lower leveled friends or it may be the system trying to test your level for promotion. i would give this game a 8/10 and recommed it to anybody who hasnt tried it.",8
"this game is awesome, playing online with friends and stuff... its cool!! but sometimes there is cheaters too.. i hate that",8
"cs:go is a fun, competive game for competing aganist players and settling scores, but it seems like cs:go is going to become the new tf2. why must i say that? well, because theyre adding tradable weapons, crates, keys, and trading in general. soon, just like tf2, cs:go shall be free to play, then everything just becomes really overrated. but overall, fun game to play.",1
"highly reccomend this: good gore good community fun competitive matches 10/10",3
"gets awped through seven foot concrete wall insta headshot 10/10 would do it again",1
"a great game, ive got it cheap (3,49). its worth every cent!",1
"a must if you love fps games! been playing this one since i was a kid and i was surprised to see new weapons added to the game. nice work valve!",1
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",2
"i was against cs for a long time till my friends made me play it. this game needs hundreds (more like thousands) of hours to manster, but an awesome choise if you are bored of the 10 year olds in cod. except the da**n cheaters and lagg sometimes it is a great buy, recommended :)",9
"great fps game. provides in depth, realistic strategies finishing off to be a superb game [the nigerians:5/5]",6
"awesome game, excellent online experience! the most addictive part of the game is the weapon skin trading. thanks to this you make many new friends and have a lot of fun! global gaming is certainly not missing, there are people all around the world playing cs:go! only downside of this game is the unfair ranking system.",4
"best fps game ive ever played really fun to play whit friends",5
"if you have played other counter-strike games, you know what youre in for. this is yet another great cs game, with several new features, including the amazing automatic match maker.",1
"so use the nova its better than most guns at most ranges i have factory new graphite stattrak named justins love pump one thousand souls taken and counting so join me wont you? and bring your nova!",4
"its as addicting as heck, has a learning curve for you to keep playing, and skins everywhere. only problem is that my irl friends arent playing it now. hopefully this review helps.",1

"great game you should get it fun to play get cool weapons good graphics great fun competative",2
"things that you learn when playing counter-strike:global offensive 1. russian (mostly  blyat) 2. how to get mad as . 3. how to hate the game. 4. but then you go back to it cuz its ing addicting. 5. and then russians kick you and you get a 7 day ban. 6. how to shoot things. 8/8  game - ign",3
"i played this game, i was shot in the face not even a minute in and then my killer said lol u screb i r smurfin get gud we are goin to win we won that game later on and i went k:11 a:4 d:2 11/10 would get shot in face again",1

"it is a good game until you start playing competetive mode when you have to go out somewhere when you end the game session it gives you a cooldown this can be a 1 hour or even 7 days this means you cant play competetive mode untill then it is a really bad idea for counter strike so i wouldnt recomend on competetive however the online games are pretty good",1
"love this game! :) i have been playing counter strike since cs 1.6 and i absolutely love this one :)",2
"i very like this game. very good game every one should try it better then all cs",6

"awesome game! but be aware: i wasted so much money on those cool weaponskin, you could probably heal cancer with that.",5
"super fun, worth $15, on sale often, highly recommend this game. counter-strike: global offensive is one of many counter-strike games. it is an awesome first person shooter!",1
"still one of the most competitive games out there, if you dont have this already, youre missing out",6
"i reccomend this game but.......i get bullied in this game....a lot...",2
"this en game. dont buy you will never get any thing good. all the noobs will get . this game doesnt even make sense. my team has like nerf guns and the other team has like explosive ap rounds that go through en battle ships. ill play this game when there is an update saying that both teams will get guns that have bullets and both teams will have armor not plastic armor kevlar. but gabe will never do this cuz this game is so bad",5
"this is a very good game, also it is very community friendly; if you want a good game you should get this. (hope you enjoy) -panda",3
"this game is only fun in competitive. but you can get banned very easily. >:(",5
"i really do reccomend it its really fun to play with friends ,but the only thing i dont like is that you can get banned from comp for 7 days thats a bit to much like 2 days should be fair but other then that it really fun even if you play by yourself i had fun playing it when i first got it and none of my friends had it but then they got it and it started to get better and better so yes i do reccomend this game have fun if you do buy it just dont  around on comp cuase you can get banned from it. so 8/10",7

"personally, counter strike is one of the most outstanding fps (first-person shooter) franchise to be established. they deliver so many things that has increased the fans over the years. it is also welcoming to new players all around. to that, i recommend the game, with a sick gameplay and awesome content.",4
"15/10 virtual knives cost more than the actual thing #byecreditcard",3
"this game is super fun. i find it very theraputic when im angry because it allows me to take out my aggression by shooting people. the ai on the bots are not very solid. the stage layout can be a maze and sometimes the bots will take a back way and get lost and leave the rest of the group to die.. or win. i havent played online yet (trying to better my skills before i try playing with the pros ;3 ). but, i can say that playing with the bots are a lot of fun and i enjoy the game a bunch. perhaps, one of my favorite games i play on steam.",1
"so if you dont have this by now... i guess get it? skins. thats all ima say.",7
"pretty cool game but it can get a bit boring after a while, adding more gamemodes would be nice",6
"really great game! though i expected there would be a lot of guns/weapons to be unlocked, but eitherway its a great game :)",1
"would recommend if you mind seeing all the terrorists as arabs (except for one or two maps).",2
"cool and awesome game, but needs more possibilities!",4
"worth your time and improves your aiming skills if you tryhard in competitive",8
"great game. this game is my current addiction. it can be frustrating at times with hit and miss hit registration. 5v5 competitive play is very nice and one of the best parts of the game.",10
"its yop season and errbody getting caught with no coats",3
"been a cs fan since 2002. gotta say this game really feels like its a better version of the old one thats for sure. gotta love deathmatch mode, instant action and plenty of skill involved. oh and btw,  off you awp-noobs! >:3",1

"this steam game so far for me is really fun. even though i only have 100 hours logged into the game, i still have many things to learn and find from a variety of people! making new friends and dominating other players brings me much joy from playing this game. if youre looking for a game that will last you more than 24 hours, i may suggest you this game. just a warning from me, if you get addicted to games easily, youll find it hard to get away from this one. enjoy playing!",4
"very nice game but community should be better, less hackers aswell please.",7
"cs:go is different to most fps games ive played. its got 2 teams, both have an objective, and the teams have weapons that balance out according to the objective. most of the core competitive maps balance out the weapons and objectives even more, and theyre also aesthetically pleasing. cs:go should appeal to all skill levels, with its competitive ranking system youre almost guarenteed to find a balanced game with people your skill level when you play in matchmaking. overall, id probably give cs:go a 9.5/10, it could use some more balancing between the m4a4 and m4a1, but other than that its perfect for an fps of this day and age.",5
"pros: whoever is better than you is a hacker. whoever than you is worse is a noob. if you want to learn russian play cs:go, . every game has a 10 or younger player who is either worse or better then you. cons: you occasionally find someone normal. called noob/hacker every game 420/69",2
"started from the bottom. now all i can see in my inventory are weapon skins...weapon skins everywhere!",3
"its a mixture of cs1.6 and css, good fun and worth the buy!",5
"freakin excellent fps game. recommended for ppl who like to shoot.",1
"a truly outstanding game by valve, which everyone has heard of. the temple and the progenitor of all shooters. game of childhood. does one need to say more? the remake was more than successful. all his hopes, he fully justified. graphics and the gameplay has changed significantly. new weapons and maps, nice paint nostalgic memories. if youre a fan of the series cs, feel free to take this game. constantly updated workshop stirs interest. the game is still alive. the last of the legendary family 9 chickens out of 10",4
"a much improved counterstrike game ! enjoy playing ! go go go.. go.. ! ! new weapons added ! maps look differnt and improved graphics !",5
"love this game. i play cs since v 1.3 and i love it !!! the only ing thing is that sometimes it goes sooo bs !",6
"its a brilliant and challenging game thati reccomend to everyone but if you like scope on you rifles and smgs then you wont be to happy since this game features only scopes on 6 guns",3

"you know who can drive..................................................... me",1
"this is exactly what needed, it plays and feels like cs 1.6 except with a highly updated graphics engine. the game is visually stunning and gameplay is unmatched by any other first person shooter. many modes of gameplay to suit the players, whether they be casual or for the highly competetive, and a state-of-the-art matchmaking system that hooks players up with matches based on skill level almost instanteously. the previous iteration cs source was a dissapointment to many cs fans as if offered ridiculiously large hit boxes and extremely low recoil.",8

"great addition to the counter strike series. lets hope they implement source2 into csgo, without making us buy cs2 for the new engine! regardless, well done valve. <3 with cs:go, esports as a whole is getting its well-deserved rapid growth because of the new fundamentals/mechanics/ease of access available in cs:go. bravo!",4
"when i was kid i started play with cs 1.3, then keep playing cs:s comes out. cs:s was not so good, so i stick with 1.6. now, i really love cs:go, its more fun than casual 5v5 scrim, its more social, its more realistic. more than game, its very competitive-like.so totally worth it. and of course we love custom skins, community maps + steam workshop is perfect 10/10 if you like fps genre, must have it!",6
"game is really fun with 4 other friends. tactical and the skill cap is very high. it is a good break game from too much dota :d",4
"counter strike: global offensive (otherwise known as cs:go) is the newest game in the counter strike series. since ive already done a review of counter strike: source, im just going to talk about the many gameplay changes that go introduces to the series. firstly, the guns all have more kick to them, making run-n-gun players hugely greivanced. the guns all feel authentic and sound amazing, but i personally dont enjoy using the snipers and i cant stand the heavy weapons (i.e. miniguns). the weight of each gun has been pretty drastically increased, leaving slower and more methodical gameplay in its path. if you remember cs:s, there a probably 2 things you noticed: 1. there were very few shotguns, and 2. there were only two grenade types. well, in go, there are now 5 types of shotgun, and 4 different types of grenades! i personally believe is the best game in the counter strike series, and its methodical gameplay makes for a difficult experience, for both newcomers, and seasoned veterans.",1
"counter strike has come a long way since it was a half-life mod in the late 90s and is still just as fun as the first day i played it. if youre looking to purchase an fps that will outlast any cod or battlefield game youve ever owned stop here. weve been playing on the same core maps since the beginning and we still come back for more. theres no other fps experience like it. valves best title in my opinion.",4
"i have played a lot of call of duty (until bops 2) and battlefield fps shooters, but this one takes the cake. with all of the issues with bf4 at launch, i wanted to try cs as ive heard a lot of positive buzz about it. wow...the map designs are great, no netcode or lag issues (that ive seen), people are helpful in the game (as a newb i need a lot of advice), and the graphics are really good. i would definitely recommend this game - especially when you can get it on sale. its a lot of fun and very challenging.",2
"i recommend this game me and my friends play it everyday its a good use my time left over before i sleep xd",8
"learn to hate russians and polskies for a very cheap price!",2
"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",7
"counter strike:global offence is honestly the best fps ive ever played. a must buy! :)",2
"amazing game, pretty awesome graphics wise, would recommend doing competitive with friends though.",1
"this is a sweet game, however, if you happen to join the server that im playing you will have a miserable experience, as i will pwn you.",2
"counter strike : global offensive is definitely worth the buy, competitive mode offers the kind of competitive play that you look for in tournaments and the hit box feels more realistic than other fps. there are also the community made maps and servers that also do make the game a lot more fun.",4
"fantastic game for beginners and pros alike, well worth buying.",1
"this is a game of progrssion and you wont get anywere if you just start it and then get annoyed that your losing. but with some time and effort it becomes a really enjoyable game.",3
"amazing game, lots of fun. but i dont like the 64 tick on most servers tho.",2
"counter-strike: global offensive is probably my favorite game right now becuase of the possibilities in-game. you have all the weapons in the game to start of with, but there is a lot of skins to make them look better. there is a huge amount of skins you can collect from cases, marketing and betting. you can also get nice drops from missions. the game is almost all about statrategy and chemistry between players. there is also different roles. the most played gamemode is probably competetive. after 10 matches won, you will receive a rank that will organize who you are gonna play with. the ranking system is based on the elo system. there is also deathmatch, arms race and casual. the cs:go community is huge and i could easily give this game a 10/10 becuase of that.",6
"i love this game so much because it reminds me of halo and call of duty and thats the best part about it. my rate for this game is 10",3
"truly an fps, tactical and close combat game that is too addictive.",2
"finaly a hacker free cs with competitive quickplay. two thumbs up!",3
"#1 tactical fps of all time. is what you are told about this game, and within a hour of playing it, youll say the same. epic.",6
"not much t be said! best competative fps game ever. cs has always been",5
"go into counterstrike matchmaking game immediately get made fun of for being trans top frag and carry bad teammates laugh as they are still hating on me and i am the only reason we are winning start killing in console team kicks me team loses game that they were up 13-3 i would say cs is the greatest game ever but that is an understatement just remember one thing your first good game means nothing what means something is when you can do consistently well and also remember time in cs means a lot whether its for practicing aim or just gaining game sense the more time you have in cs the better off you are if you start off not being able to get a kill deathmatch and improve aim and then just play matchmaking much more than a normal human being and bam you are going to be golden ^_^",7
"its not like the old days of cs 1.6, but global offensive does everything source did... just better. fantastic menu, fun gameplay, skins, competive etc. - my faith in counter strike has been won back.",1
"a++. product arrived as described. would recommend to friends.",3
"a must have game, very addictive and have shame if you havent got this game",2
"if you like shooting snd game this is game for you <3 love this game",1
"after tens of hours of playing this game. i can conclude that its another classic counterstirke. beautiful game, takes skill to play (bye bye cod  boys). every kill is satifying and teamates help you. just great. what a classic 9/10",1
"very good game.dont get boring after 40h of playing",6
"best game ever! the game play is magnificent but the community could be better with out the scammers!!!!!",3
"counter strike: global offensive is basically a very big update to counter strike: source. featuring much better graphics, gameplay, maps, etc. i really enjoy playing this game whether i win or lose matches. cs:go, in my opinion, is a much better alternative to call of duty. but, i was definitely not expecting valve to give cs:go the tf2 treatment, with the skins and items. today, you have knives going for about $200+, and thats just an outragous price for a virtual item. to see people are actually buying items and making money off of this game (and losing more) is just, wow. im personally not a fan of this, but i guess, it seemed to of worked out for valve in the long run. every time i see someone with an extremely expensive knife/skin, it kills me a little on the inside. cs:go is still a very fun game nonetheless, and would suggest it to anyone fond of strategic fps games. just, try not to spend too much money on these kind of games. sometimes, you dont even realize how much money youre spending on it.",2
"great game! awesome graphics/great connection/ and awesome guns i love it worth the price!",2
"call of duty... too unrealistic & quick paced? battlefield 4, too hard not to get killed? arma 3... too tactical and difficult for noobs? blackshot... love that game? than you will love this! this arena shooter is mixed with a tactical feeling and that teamwork and skillz are the only thing to win the game! dont worry though... skillz devolop over time.",1
"this game plays true to life just as 1.6 did. i greatly appreciate this version going back to the fundamentals that the game was meant to have. absolutely recommend this game to anyone who is up for a challenge!",6
"the cooldown system is complete rubbish and is dumb. i cant kill team mates peacefully and it sucks.  this game!",2

"i was once a man of cod, then it became a joke. i then drifted toward battlefield for a more realistic experience but only found nothing but a disapointment. these amazing franchizes ruined by the simple desire for money. and then i found countersrike, it was simple, easy to pick up, has a great community and overall just fun to play. it does something that games today have long forgotten, have fun. its the most fun ive had in gaming in a very long time, and has amazing replayablity. honestly it is the best 15$ i have ever spent in my entire life. an amazing underrated game, try it!",4
"made $10 in betting, lost it all in betting. 10/10 would bet again",3
"if you have played any other games of the series, then you wont have a problem liking cs:go. the game is great. its not better than css or 1.6 but its still a counter-strike game and super fun! also if you are a competitive person, then thats the way to go.",6
"cool game, love the fast paced gameplay! really enjoy to play this with my friends",1
"pros: no russians cons: little blue people who like to ruin your game because they suck complete .",3
"greast game love how valve gets the community involved.",2
"i havent played cs since 1.4? when steam first became mandatory to play, which i boycotted back then. anyway i bought this on summer sale last year 2013 and only recently started playing. i really like it and definately recommend this, especially when its on sale. its pretty much the same old cs but with enhanced graphics and new maps. also there are new playmodes which are nice. playing with bots to train is also very easy and perhaps even recommended to get used to the weapons and maps. the only bad thing i would have to say, is like on every team based game; your team makes a huge difference. if you happen to be against better team, you just lose. not that loosing is bad mind you. i see a lot of players quitting when they realize the team has no chance, trying to keep up a good kill/death -ratio perhaps? all in all, a very good legendary game that you should definately try.",2
"an amazing game. that pretty well sums it up. this game was thought of incredibly well, balancing everything to make the experience as equal and fair as can be. this game is not for those who like have a casual easygoing time. you need to have a tactical mind, you have to think things through by the second, to work out the best and most efficient way to manage the different situations you are in. you have to have a constant skill, without losing your nerves during tough situations. this game is for those who can take it. if you can, get it. it will be the best $15 you have ever spent. to prove, i have 150 hours, and adding on this game, and i feel like i will be able to go for ages yet.",1
"takes old fashioned counter-strike to another level, simply so amazing.",2
"probably the best modern shooter on the market atm. requires both skill and brain and i highly recommend it to all the people who like 1st person shooters.",3
"counter-strike: global offensive, if you like getting smurfed by nerds who cant stay at their own rank, hacked by kids who cant get good, and a ranking system though up by a  monkey then this game is for you.",3
"this game is awesome, if you loved the older game then you are in for a treat ! the skin system is great, opening certain types of cases helps the competetive scene and because of that we can have awesome tournaments like ems katowice :d also, the ranking system is pretty good, altough it does have some flaws. overall, i recommend this game for any fps lover!",6
"counter strike global offensive is a team-based multiplayer shooter by valve. and it is amazing. this is now my first counter-strike game and it makes the series look good. with great graphics, gamemodes, and everything, this is a good experience meant for you to play alone or with friends. and with friends is where the game shines. customize your experience with workshop mods to play with new maps, weapons, and everything. counter-strike global offensive is officially awesome.",1

"this game is the best game ever made! valve very good job becouse 90 % of this game is made by community and that is awesome! i love this game like every other counter-strike but this one has somehing more and thats what i love on this game :)",4
"most comments sound like 10 yr olds typed them, csgo has turned into something that counterstrike should never have become. with all this rubbish i got this and i purchased that etc.. if you want good old cs fun like it used to be then play cs:source or 1.6 i like go when it first came out and really though it would be the next cs, now its just nothing short of money grabbing c*ap here waiting for a new and proper cs game in the future!",1
"this game is all around good. i love the combat systems and the knifing. and when you pull the trigger on the gun and it goes pop pop. but i wish it was more cod like.",2
"awesome game. not the same community as 1.6 but definitely as competitive as all cs versions. rate for competitive gamers.",4
"favorite current fps but not all time. all of the game modes that the game offers are fun if you enjoy the game and often made updates to the game are satisfying (operation packs). aside from cheaters and griefers, who youll come across surely, matchmaking is my favorite along side with casual. community servers offer a lot of fun maps and game modes as well such as: zombie; de_surf; de_rats; etc. the game offers a bonus mini-game which is called unboxing a case. if you choose to play it you will often be left with disappointment and questions raised by your family such as where has all the money gone?. some say the ecstasy you recieve from winning some of the rarest items in the game is worth the tears you cry after opening some of these cases. legend says that by selling the most valuable item recieved from the unboxing a case game youll have enough money to buy ever game on steam. 10/10, would open more.",4
"great teamwork great gameplay and great weapon skins. what more could you possibly want?",3
"this game is so hard-core! most of the guns dont have aim down sites, there is on regenerating health, there are no perks or kill streaks; everything is based on skill and skill alone. play it and you will be amazed! :d",1
"ready? *clicks ready* 10 people accept round #1 one guy leaves before the round starts round #2 we are leading either way round#3 now we have two bots, i thought they confermed they were ready ttt round#4 we loose round #5 close win round #6 guy wants a kick but doesnt want to surrender even though 2/3 wanted to surrender, round #7 we kick the guy, hes so freaking dumb he gets a day ban well kk round #8 it just started we are loosing, alright time to try to clutch.... or no.. that one guy on my team kicks me.. now the game is basically saying you have a cooldown for too many kicks wot that was like my first kick well alright -restarts cs- what!! 7 days? really valve....  cooldown sys good game 7/10",2

"counter-strike: global offensive the game that killed my life in one way or a nother. its a very good tactical shooter. it is senserely a good game by valve +community +chill game +teamwork +workshop (community made maps,guns,stickers) -can feel a bit laggy for time too time (network) -hackers (they fastly ban hackers but it can bee a problem. but they have fixed the comp system when playig whit a hacker or againts a hacker( it erases the match if you lose but noting if you manage to winn agients a hacker) -the persons that play competetive and are not ready yet soo this is a very good game but needs work in some plases but its totaly whort the mony. disclaimer this is not cod/bf this is a realy hard game too some extent you need to learn every thing again this is a realy good game and i will give it a 10/10 as of my experiense but a 9/10 if u count the networck problems (and no its not on my side) valve you have done it again",8

"i recommend this game if youre a fan of the fps-genre. some of my pros : + nice weapon updates compared to earlier games + great visual experiences + a lot of players with a rich competitive scene + skins for your weapons make the gaming experience even richer. + easy to learn, hard to master :) some of my cons : - youll get flamed at a lot if youre bad (as i am) and in competitive games youll get votekicked all the time cause of it. - if youre experiencing lags youll have a bad time since this game is all about reaction and reactiontime. - i miss the cz and source gamelobby. - sometimes it feels like youre a noob just because you dont own that many skins as others. even though skins doesnt equal skill it still feels like this hehe. i still recommend this game as it is a fast-paced fps title which keeps on evolving with every new title. pardon me, im off to play some arms race. cya on the battlefield.",1

"its a good game. its much harder to pick up than any other shooter because of its mechanics. this isnt really a bad thing, as youll get used to it eventually and it makes it even more fun to get kills (especially headshots) because of its difficulty. the community in this game isnt really the best, as most of the players playing in competetive are people who wont cooperate and russians. this makes it really heard to communicate with your team you might have been matched with in the competetive gamemode. so having somebody you know to play competetive with is much better and easier as teamwork is necessary for winning this game. other than that i must say that most weapons here are very well balanced because of how the money system works. if i would have the option to change one thing in this game it would be to make competetive (or just generally all valve servers) 128 tick, as it would make the game more based on how well you play and less on whos the most lucky in a gunfight.",9

"what amazes me about this game is the special ambience the player lives while playing the game consciously. its not just a random fps game thats about shooting the adversaries randomly, as it requires subliminal reactions and reflexes. the simplicity of the game makes the gamer focus more on the precision of his shots and actions than on the graphics (although the graphics are acceptable) and on the rest of the petty details. blatantly, the game was thoughtfully developed by the brave developers, who are still working on the game till nowadays, and are still considering the complaints of players and working on improving the gameplay to satisfy everybody. this game is a great successful accomplishment to the developers of valve. *proto tips the hat* overall: fascinating game.",6

"this game will consume your life for the next few 40 years -legal gambling simulator -paying lots of money for skins -skins that are worth more than your meal today what you will experience: -playing your first games on casual cs_office -learning about competitive -playing competitive -learn ropes of the game -get yelled at for being bad -yell at someone for being bad -get better at the game -rank up to a better rank that isnt silver -still playing with people that play like silvers -playing with smurfs (not the blue midgets, the people who are higher ranks and buy another account to rek u) -play 6 good games in a row and not rank up -lose 1 game and derank -smash your keyboard and play another game -come back to csgo rinse, wash, repeat 10/10 life waster",4
"spent more money on skins then the actual game 10/10 gaben take my money",2
"easy to learn, hard to master. great game whether youre a casual plebian like me, or an fps veteran. the skins are a bonus: you can pretty much recoup the cost of the game if youve been playing for a while.",1
"good game, but when i selected arms race, you run on your feet, a bit unrealistic. 9.5/10",8
"have you ever wanted to be a car, kid? well now you still cant but you can cry yourself to sleep over the rounds you dropped, the friends you let down, and the relationships that you destroyed on cs:go. also, this game came in first at the iowa state fair of 1945 for its help in the manhattan project at trinity. this game has a half-life to that similar to that of carbon-14, and is now being used for carbon dating techniques based on your win/loss ratio on vertigo. whenever a bomb is thrown off of the side of the map, the carbon-14 deposits plummet by the iq of the closest spider to the dalai lama.",5
"counter strike is one of the most brutal, unrelentfull and difficult games to master. the 2013 patches has made the game incridible satisfying to get good at, and it offers a feeling of mastery no other game could offer. with its sharp learning curve and punishing defeats, its hard to get into, but worth it.",6
"crap someone buy this for me really though, i dont have it anymore. it is fun though, shoot guns and be competitive. get some cool gear and better guns, probably not pay to win. another classic by valve! 8/10 note: may ruin your life edit: someone did buy it for me! thanks bread!",2
"probably the best counter-strike at the moment. it just keeps getting more features : competitive mode, matchmaking, skins for guns to raise funds for cs league, video and highlights from all your past matches, watch live games, better hostages mode, gun game mode includes. however, they just keep adding stuff without fixing all the issues and bugs from past updates. this games is unplayable for some people over the internet but great in lan. the gun skins update brought lower fps to the game, going down by 80 to 120 fps.",7

"mljay welcome to the space jam clutch 420 blaze it",1
"good alternative to cs:s and cs 1.6. i used to play cs 1.3 i wish i could play that game again. cs:go is worth buying.",1
"its surely the best cs so far, if you can overlook the fact that competitive matchmaking ranks mean nearly nothing, as well as if you can deal with being kicked and consequentially put in matchmaking cooldown by a team of four people. you can also invest few thousands of dollars to buy fancy weapons. a good game in the end, but only if you play it with friends.",5
"pros - good graphics - good gameplay - chickenzzz - requires skill ( not like cod (children online daycare) ) - you can learn russian launguage cons - rank system is the worst - i hear this russians 8/10 is gud",3

"i highly suggest this game if you enjoy countering the strikes or various similar actvities.",4
"i just love this game, i got it a short while ago and i absoluteely cannot stop playing it ever! this is the game for people who are tacticle and love a challenge, anyone can play, but always be prepared to lose. the game is heavily balanced *cough*awp*cough* and very fun to play. 10/10 would play again!",1

"i think evrbody should have this game its fabulous",1
"this is a great competative first person shooter. it is based completely on personal skill because of the fact that there is no ads. so movement affects you recoil, which forces you to learn the recoil for a specific gun. also, the community servers are really good and fun.",4
"game is good, fun, etc. rank system doesnt work. call of duty havent rank system and is more balanced than counter- strike! smurfers everywhere.",3
"best game ever, good community, good physics, everything is good about csgo. love the recoil in the game which is pretty hard to control but overall is one of the best online games. 10/10 would play again !!",5

"very good fps for the more hardcore gamer, not as noobfriendlt as most other shooters!",5
"this game should really be taken off of steam, the game is filled to the brim with smurfs and hackers. i have tried getting into it with friends on three different time and each time i get more dissapointed. the ammount of players never changes. the only reason they still have it as one of the top selling games is because of all the people buying for alternate accounts and its just sad that they have to do that please dont give valve money for this trainwreck they get enough from all the smurfs and hackers buying it for their alternate accounts.",4

"great game love it sooo fun grachics are amazeingg pretty easy to run on a 600$ computer or even a normal pc can run this or even a laptop a normal one love this ggame the way its made tons of free maps tons of free updates and cool game skins to pay for that look very cool i love this game best game i ever played but the rank system is kind of bad because of teams and the match makeing bans are bs but still its an great game i recommend to any kind of fps gamer",6
"i would recommend older counter strikes rather than this game even if i give this game a 9.5/10, i would rather play some css than this. with upgraded grapichs and now that you can have items skins on your weapons , this game became like tf2 good game with horribly community and overhyped/overpriced items like ak-47 vulcan wich is like 50$ fun to play with friends but i gotta say that this game is pretty fast made i mean its one of those: quick! we need to make some money but how?... how bout a sequel to counter strike to make money on! oh and make it like tf2 with keys and crates all dat crap! okay i was a little hard against csgo but i can still see taht valve added some love this game. and do not get me started on the knifes... 9.5 awp out of 10 awp!",2

"very fun to play, very nicley balanced and very good graphics despite the old age",2

"pew pew kill terrorist n stuffs......or be the terrorist. ets gud.",4
"i played this in 1.6, it still has the same old feel to it, with a few new tricks. my only complaint is the 14 yr olds with a mic. if that needs explination, your probably a 14 yr old.",2
"*just gets unbanned after 7 days* *joins game* *four russians kick you* another 7 days of being banned.",3
"this game is amazing i have started a team too its better than call of duty and battle field and its really competitive so get your hands on a copy and play with me add me on skype xveano i also do frag movies on this game its so funnnn",4
"cs:go offers a competitive matchmaking feature - unlike cs:s and cs. this feature also includes a ranking system which i think makes it even more exciting and its a great way to easily find a match without having to use irc, etc. in addition theyve added molotov and decoy grenades, which i think is great even though i usually just go with the same old 2 flash, 1 nade, 1 smoke. through recent updates, they added weapon skins and stickers. it basically means that you get to play with dolls as a guy. i think its decent and it doesnt affect the gameplay in any way. if you were a fan of cs or cs:s, youll probably like this game. you just gotta get used to it. ive seen many people complain about it at first but they all ended up loving it anyway. so, basically, what im saying is; if you liked the previous counter-strike games, you should definitely try this out, too. i recommend it.",7
"makes you feel awful about yourself for the first week, 10/10 would recommend",1
"love the game. started out with playing soruce now this. wish they had zombies mode like in source but meh its good!",3
"as a long time counter strike player, i can safely say this game has some serious flaws and is far from simply being 1.6 with better graphics.. but it is incredibly fun just like every other version of cs.",6
"this game will take your life and all your money. great game.",4
"absolutely amazing game of ups and downs, the thing im really reviewing is the classic competetive gamemode. this game mode is absolutely superb, although it causes me to be very angry sometimes, it also causes great self gratification when i win or even get a kill, it is a wonderful game and spend quite a lot of my time on it.",6

"an excelent game for the price given. worth its weight in gold.(if you could weigh code that is)",5
"i recommend this game. all the remastered weapons have a nice feel to them without being carbon copies of weapons in the previous titles. i recommend playing with friends for best experience. the competetive mode also adds great amount of fun gameplay, as long as your teams is communicating. thats why i recommend playing with friends. 10/10 would definently recommend.",1

"* chickens now can walk ! a real counter strike revolution. grab it while you can lads.",5
"cs:go is the perfect child of 1.6 but 1000 times better engine and graphics. the different game modes are awsome! demolition: small maps and quick games couldt be excetuted better. competetive: filled with idiots downing your rank quickly , the only way to get a better rank is to play with atleast 4 friends and try to take care of the one tard that doesnt lissen or speak. casual: good ol cs 1.6 in a new body deathmatch: long rounds with respawn on the normal maps. you get to buy your own kit and try out or play with different tactics all and all its an awsome game 100% woth the money! 9.5/10 - a new must have on steam",4
"community is full of s that are exceptionally competitive and most likely played the game non-stop since release. i dont really want to go back to this if the community thinks that having a life outside of counter strike is like announcing the holocaust was justified.",1

"excellent game.. spent over 100hrs on the game. what more do i have to say.",4
"this is a great game and if you like the situation of terrorists vs police then you will love this game. this multiplayer game has many maps to choose from and has mode you can play on. plus it has a variaty of weapons that you can get to kill your enemy. i highly reccomend it.",1
"easily the best multiplayer shooter that ive ever played. its a ridiculously addictive timesink thats fun to play alone or with friends. hell, it even pays for itself with all the drops!",2
"cs go is a cheap imitation of source...for a rehatch of a classic it is boring bland and lacks everything..its good in a way for call of duty players with the aim and hit system..when you kill someone in cs go it doesnt feel like it,source makes you earn your kills and is satisfying every kill...cs go couldve been amazing but i personally think its waaaaay under the mark of first person shooters brought out around the same time,id rather play black ops 2 than cs go and thats saying something!!!!!!!! css all the way...rightmate!",1

"the best counter strike in the series! everything looks great, all the guns feel good, and plenty of varied game modes!",1
"dont even buy this, its not worth it. the game itself can be fun, but theres one major problem that gets in the way: the ing community. do i even have to describe how idiotic most of these s i play with are at times? random kicking, check. kids on their periods, check. those who cant even play the ing game, check. the game can be fun, but when youre getting long-as-hell cooldowns just because some random asshats decide to kick you, how can you enjoy it? i dont even know how most of the people on my friends list are capable of describing this as fun, with a community as awful as this. i suggest you get cs:s coupled with garrys mod instead. at least youre playing with people you can tolerate.",1

"this is a great game, theres not many bad things that i can say... the game is great, and runs very good, few bugs/glitches, its really only the community that is bad, smurfs, hackers, etc. 3/4 times i get matched with either a smurf, or just s who ruin the game for everyone else, you know, those people that throw, feed, and just try to piss off their own team. (im not saying the entire community is toxic, but ive seen quite a few) if we could kick people and give them a ban at the same time, i think it would fix alot of problems. of course, there are great matches with amazing teams that are friendly, and work together. overall, the game is amazing, and would defiently recommend it, but you should play with some friends.",7
"im a cod player, and i was very sceptic to this game. but now i found even more fun playing csgo than any other game i have ever played ;) i recommend this game to everyone +1",4
"this game is just awesome, but it needs a lot of skill, though, but thanks to the ranking system you are going to play against people on your skill level. i recommend playing cs:go with friends. 10 out of 10!",5

"on word i will say is  awesome  buy it now !!!",5
"i have had this game for about a year now (i think), and i highly reccomend it. if you enjoy fps games, then there is something in this for you. sure, its the hardest fps i have ever played, and it has players who arent afraid to kick you if you suck (try non competitive first), but its still an amazingly fun game even if you are a person who is only good in rare flashes (if at all) like me.",2

"i love this game although its to addicting! ... im joking its an awsome game and not to laggy (fps+).",4
"brings back the classic counter strike while elevating it to the new age of gaming and also one of the only games that inspire genuine emotion in team play. if you play long enough you will care whether or not your team wins, and if your team doesnt win you will be sure to have a good laugh from the crazy players of counter strike go.",1

"i highly recommend the game counter-strike: global offensive to anyone looking for a shooter whether they be a casual player, a pro player, or even just looking for a game to collect skins in. the game offers up a few structured game modes (such as gun game and competitive) but thats just the tip of the iceberg. cs:go also, like its predecessors, boasts a community server browser which opens the game up to a world of game modes whether it be playing as a prisoner in jail or surfing on walls. the game has great mechanics which really give you the opportunity to explore your inner shooter.",4

"knife trading simulator 2k15 but is still the best game i have ever played",5
"cs was and will always be the best fp online shooting game ever ! love you valve <3 <3 <3 !!!",1
"in my opinion counter strike:global offensive is one of the most competetive team based shooters, its ofcourse not 100% competetive since there are more gamemodes than one, although there are many game modes i still concider the competetive gamemode to be the best, i strongly recommend this game but only if you have someone to play with, i find the game really boring without friends.",1
"a much-refined first person shooter which recieves frequent balancing updates. while easier to get into than other competitive games (such as dota 2), the community can still be harsh if you underperform in the competitive mode (which comes with a decent, but not-yet-perfect ranking system). it features a few game modes appealing to all skill levels, and custom made privately run servers as well as officially run valve servers. all in all, i have very much enjoyed my time playing the game, and definitely got my moneys worth preordering it. as an added bonus, it features a very active community market, where you can sell and buy weapon skins and stickers. if you play your cards right, you can easily make back the money you spent on this game (especially if you buy it during a sale) in steam wallet funds.",4
"a fps that has evolved from a simple free mod, to a top notch competitive contender.",1
"a good fps, with competitive mode, casual, dm etc. really fun to play with friends collect skins you like for weapons. bet on tournaments",2

"awsome game! love the competitive! cs is always a classic!",3
"when you get the time or have the money i highly recommend you buy this game. if you like to game and havent bought a counter strike game you really havent played most games. this game is casual and competitive so it suits every type of fps player, and like every valve game you can have custom servers if you dont want to play deathmatch, hostage mission or demolition. from the 300 some hours ive played on this game id say it was worth the money. -droid 1-",9

"basically right this game is sick, what it is right there people u know that shoot eachother and everytime u play it u feel stiff as oat and idk if thats me getting hard or wheather im a bloody scarecrow in game know what a mean, but anyways there some good dlc like for 4p and 8p and i like this cause it encourages developers to make u pay for every littie thing thats in the game like if u want to hide behind the crate enter your bank details and you just got cover. anyways i rate this game on a level",2
"counter strike: global offensive is basically a very big update to counter strike: source. featuring much better graphics, gameplay, maps, etc. i really enjoy playing this game whether i win or lose matches. cs:go, in my opinion, is a much better alternative to call of duty. but, i was definitely not expecting valve to give cs:go the tf2 treatment, with the skins and items. today, you have knives going for about $200+, and thats just an outragous price for a virtual item. to see people are actually buying items and making money off of this game (and losing more) is just, wow. im personally not a fan of this, but i guess, it seemed to of worked out for valve in the long run. every time i see someone with an extremely expensive knife/skin, it kills me a little on the inside. cs:go is still a very fun game nonetheless, and would suggest it to anyone fond of strategic fps games. just, try not to spend too much money on these kind of games. sometimes, you dont even realize how much money youre spending on it.",2
"sometimes the world gives you lemons, and sometimes it gives you cs go for $3.75.. if you can get this on sale, get it. worst cs ever, 10/10.",3
"a great multiplayer game. very fun and very addictive",1
"can i say that im infected with this game... skins, ninjas all in the best quality that cs ever saw... love this game..",3
"still, one of the finest fps pc games out there. this newest edition builds on the legacy of what is cs and includes a whole lot more. you can still play the usual competitive games but it can organise these for you instead of searching #irc for days or trying to plan a match via a game league. it also has some fun game types such as deathmatch, demolition and much more. with the option to purchase operation bravo to play a few more maps and those that are still in beta testing its simply superb. valve also kindly provide some little holiday add ons to remind you what time of year it is when playing the game! of course it does not come without its draw backs. bullet reg isnt the best, there are still quite a few cheaters in game and you get the usual kiddie cs player who wants to whinge all game and grief but with a decent rest of the team these can simply be voted out. going for 2.99 in the 2013 holiday sale you would be an absolute fool not to buy it!",2
"i havent played cs since about 2007. i didnt enjoy css as i felt it wasnt the 1.6 upgrade i was looking for. however csgo feels alot more like cs 1.6 with updated graphics. i like all the other features like match making, badges and weapon skins :d",3
"best game evry tiem. cant life without it. buy this game, 6/6",1
"counter-strike has always held a special place in my heart, so it may be hard to speak without bias. that being said, if you are looking for a competative first person shooter, this is your game. it is no call of duty where blood distorts your view, its no battlefield with explosions all around you, it is a highly refined competative first person shooter, the phrase easy to learn, hard to master could not apply anymore to this game, the controls are simple, the maps are easy to learn, but the tacticts, teamwork, recoil compensation, and economy are something that may take you years to master. the game has a huge competative scene with multiple tournaments with prize rewards in the hundreds of thousands every year. the difficulty of the game, and the rewarding feel of getting an ak-47 headshot are something that never go away, highly recommend 10/10.",8
"very fun classic game, just dont expect to aim down sights in most guns. :]",1
"yes. of course, this is the best game if i ever experience! but! some motherfuc#ers fuc# us when we play match. please do not play match if you buy now. practice with bot, and if you think you can win when you fight with a expert bot, play at the community server or casual mode. if not, youll get dam# silvers! if you get silvers rank group, teammates are troll: 20% of the whole matches which you play. and meet smurfs or meet hacker: 10% of the whole matches which you play. so, please follow my review whose wanna buy csgo or have a plan to buy csgo. and this game also offer skin system. but!! dont purchase skin as you can! if you dont wanna wasted money, please do not purchase skin never!",5
"some one buy this game its super epic its good for meh buy for meh nnaw!",1

"i like the ak-47. ok ok good game. people will die in head shot. shot in head. shot. head. boom said the little bomb. splat.",5
"though i cannot say this is the best counter-strike game because i havent played the first 2 cs games, this is still a great game. i love the add on of skins and the updated maps are great. this will easily be the largest cs game in history. i just cant wait to see what big update will happen next. the only thing right now that i dont like is that this game doesnt run as well as other source games. still a fantastic game.",6
"i put a lot of time into this game and i got pretty decent at it, but it got to a point where victories were no longer satisfying and losses were usually the results of really salty teammates or smurfing/scripting enemies. i have over 300 hours and i paid $15 for the game, so i no doubt got my moneys worth, but half of it wasnt even enjoyable. it really comes down to what kind of matches you get put in, but i think youll find yourself getting annoyed with the game more than enjoying it past a certain point.",2
"this is a hardcore game, one of the best, but. it is not for the casual gamer. it will destroy you if you are a casual. the only game worse in that regard is unreal tournament. on a positive note, it is one of the best games ever made. period. you will not regret purchase, i will promise you that.",8

"this is the first fps to actually captivate me and keep me coming back, unlike cod this game actually requires strategies and skill opposed to the random spraying that normally happens in cod. csgo is filled with actually nice people who instead of calling you a noob try to encourage learning. this game has captivated me for the past month and a half and i hope it captivates me until the next counter strike comes out. +1.",3

"game that i would highly recomend. ive played bits and pieces of cs before but i picked up the complete pack and have been hooked on csgo since. it plays smoothly and its fun to play with friends. i love just looking in sheer awe of getting a cross map headshot with a deagle or winning against an awp with just a p2000. highly recomended",2
"always been a counter-strike fan, played them all and this is my favorite one by so far and this brought me back to the series after a long break. absolutely love the competetive matchmaking to find players to almost equal skill level as you and the feature to party up with your friends and play a game (casual or competetive) with them. and the new game modes are also fun and the fact that you can search official cs servers and the community made ones. the game is good, but they need to buff the shotties a little bit (except the mag-7) cause im tired of getting 80-98 damage point blank (espacially with the nova)! shotties are made to kill with one shot or medium damage with fast followup shots. :c (okay rant part is over) summary: i love this game alrdy even tho only 70 hours in the bank, but it has its problems like every game out there. if you like fps games and/or counter-strike give this game a try and be brave and try out the competetive matchmaking too! :3",5

"one of my all-time favorite games, and my favorite fps to date. very basic ideas, but the gameplay stays fun, even though there are only 5 gamemodes, its still one of my favorites. the weapon skins within the game also add to the overall enjoyment. these are used to trade and can earn you some extra steam wallet cash. overall, a very fun and somewhat competitive game that is great to play with friends. overall rating: 9.25/10",2

"this game is fun, it requires a lot of teamwork to be successful. the shooty bits are quite enjoyable although if youre used to more modern games then youll find it might take a while to adjust to the movement penalty, recoil, aim punch, and armor mechanics. in my opinion its worth learning these things, the game is really enjoyable.",1

"dying so many times but i still love this game, it really depends on my teammates. love to play this game :)",1
"simply a awesome game.... it gives you that classic fps feel made by valve (the guys from steam). so the game involves everything steam has to offer. good examples would be the voice over ip, the integrated market system and etc. and with market system, i mean that you can actually earn money by the items you earn through the game :) the cons however would be the same as every other arena/competitive shooter.... although i must say, that the beta system in place called overwatch. somewhat involves the community in countering some of the cons.",4

"cs:go is blast to play. as a former 1.6 player, go gets most of the elements that made both 1.6 and source so successful while still bringing counter-strike forward into the present day. although i wish there was more focus on releasing more community maps for permanent competitive play as well as bridging the gap between valve sanctioned map releases and their competitive counterparts, it seems like the development team is moving the right direction. they do a good job of listening to the communitys needs and updates are released weekly.",3
"this game is definately worth the price! i would advise you to watch out how much you spend in game, though. several people i know have spent more than $200.00 on gun skins. it is really fun to play competively and casually! i would recommend it to any fps fan!",2

"counterstrike really struck gold since its launch in 2012. not only the game on its own is nice looking and plays very well, the workshop offers a place for the community to put their own designed skins for the guns. this is probably the reason why valve also makes allot of money off of this game. it is pretty cheap at around 5-7 dollars/euros, but the selling of skins on the market, even though they only get a couple of cents for each,really gets in the money. not to mention the cases; these are boxes filled with a variety of gun skins ranging from ordinary (blue) to extremely rare (red), if you get really lucky and strike a knife you are instantly guaranteed around 50+ dollars (at the moment). ofcourse it is very prestigious to own a knife so most people like to show it around. lastly, recently a tournament in germany attracted the attention of over 400,000 people on twitch at once! this is huge, making cs:go one of the best shooters of this moment.",3
"this game on the other hand is purely awesome. its different in many ways, it takes a while before you get used to the aiming system though. compared to other fps(first person shooter) games. but when you do. ohgod, the game is amazingly fun and they even got this mode (competitive ~ ranked) you can play. its 10 games then you get your rank and youll be playing against players at your own level. so i strongly recommend this game if you are looking for a new fps game. the only bad thing about this game as ive noticed so far is that it eats away some of my money, but there i am at fault myself.. but i enjoy having new weapon skins so a man gotta do what a man gotta do yknow. other than that the game itself is flawless! my opinion ~ rate: 10/10",4
"fun and competitive game touching on the 1st person shooter aspects that we know and love.",3
"ive spent more money on skins than i have the game.",4
"this is one of the most solid strategic shooters i have ever played, i love this game the hacker count is high but its one game and theyre gone. you need to listen to your team, silent team = silent game. you need to play smart, run and gun = splattered brains this game is not for all the fps loving gamers but this is defenitley a good title and should stay that way for a long time to come. hope you found this helpful thank you please leave feedback.",2
"great game! if you love/like the legacy cs games, youll thoroughly enjoy cs:go. the improvements made from cs:s to cs:go are outstanding and the 5v5 competitive mode makes the experience even better. the customization with the skins are a great idea and added to continously.",3

"i stopped playing cs back in 1.6 times. cs:go is the first counter strike i was interested in since a very long time. and wow, im impressed.",1
"other than the fact that im a total noob at this game, and that the community sucks, its fun. 10/10 would buy",1
"really meshes 1.6 and source groups together, mods are even better imo. great buy.",2
"well what to say.bombs and terrosts.vlad the impaler approves",1
"so something about the game : servers buggy(the most 64 ticket servers) usually connection errors server crashing buggy hitboxes(the most buggy hitboxes in 64 ticket servers) buggy game( sometimes happened to me i was stucked in my teammate and i couldnt move of course when the game started or i fell under texture and ye, these problems i have usually in competitive matches, only one solution - type into console kill) usually laggy servers( before year it was ok, actually the servers are",3
"in 2002, i played a few games of cs 1.6, which has started and since been remembered as the best fps ive ever played. (other than perfect dark, golden eye etc, thats a different topic.) then cs:s came along, which i will proudly say today is the best fps on steam currently. to counter what others say about it, yeah it has flaws. what game doesnt? anyways, cs:go used to be a highly despised game when it came out, and like every game it had issues. i think that most, if not some or all major issues with the game have been ruled out already. despite a slightly growwing community of hackers in higher ranks, (a problem that all and i mean all games will have,) which i am not sure can ever be fixxed once it appears. (kind of like arma 2.) i recommend this game not because of a biased opinion, but because it is the only fps that i can play and actually enjoy it. sometimes you get matched with people with a lower rank, or dont know the map, but hey, youre that guy sometimes as well. 90/100, that deagle update.",2
"if i had a choice of getting my  cut off or never be playing this game again, id choose getting my  cut off.",8
"i like counter strike, but what i dont like is the community, the community has put me off this game and its a complete shame as well. i would play the  out of this game but i cant without being shouted at for being the last guy standing against a team of 6 people alone most of the time.",1
"this game is amazing and addictive then you play matchmaking and come across the endless russian twits, hackers, high rank smurfs who play at mid level ranks to win easy games for fun, did i mention hackers? serious though, overwatch is a joke and this game is overun by hackers in a broken ranking system game. if you buy this game, enjoy it but dont ever play matchmaking or youll break something in rage as you get wallhacked with an awp from across the map.",4
"great game that makes me remember why i played earlier versions of counter strike so much.",2
"its a good game. takes a lot of skill, not just your average run and gun shooter game. has a nice competitive system, although matchmaking can get upsetting at times. at the early stages, valve never really cared about the hackers, until a later date. id say 95% of cheats are no longer working, so the game is pretty safe, for now. 10/10 id play it alot.",8
"this game suck big time baning system is a ing pease of  kicked one person and got 7 days ban",7
"the game has the best balance of tact, strategy, teamwork, and skill of any realistic fps ive played ever. worth every penny i paid, but actually it was gifted to me... so that phrase doesnt work. its still awesome, and you should definitely buy it if you enjoy computer fps games. after playing almost 300 hours the game still holds up as my favorite fps ever. the teamwork element and individual skill/game sense gains even more importance as you progress through the ranks. although im still one of the lower ranks (gold nova 2) i still enjoy the game a lot with friends and random matchmaking lobbies. and by the way, ninja defusing is the best thing ever. ninja is love, ninja is life.",4
"an amazing game, extremely competitive, some crazy looking weapons that you can get and a great interface. deffo worth the cheap price!",4
"the game has a learning curve, but its loads of fun. crisp controls and gameplay.",1
"played so well, isis tried recruiting me. 11/10 got me a job",6
"this game is really awesome i would really recommaend it",1
"the only competetive shooter worth playing on the pc",1
"are we rushin in or are we goin sneaky-peaky like?",1
"i obviously like this game.. been playing since i was a little kid and still play it. most likely i will still play later on if i have the time.",6
"in a world where first person shooter games are produced by giant video game coorporations to leech you of your money, one game rises above the rest in terms of skill and gameplay. this is counter strike",10
"luckily this game is out on mac and windows platform . this is good because due to the other games which are only supported for windows and linux . your $14.99 worth of money will be worth buying this game and also there is a counter-strike complete pack available and it includes +includes 4 items: counter-strike, counter-strike: condition zero, counter-strike: source, counter-strike: global offensive but the platform is still mac and windows available only . sorry to those who have a linux computer/laptop",2
"favorite counter strike hands down. competitive modes, awesome graphics, weapon skins, and amazing new maps make it perfect.",2
"this is probably the best shooter ever made. cs:go has anything that was in the previous versions of cs, plus it adds awesome skins and item drops like crates. if youre lucky enough you can get rare items dropped, which you then can sell on the market. that being said, you not only have an awesome shooter with millions of maps, plenty game mods and brilliant matchmaking. in cs:go you also have a cash-cow. go idling, milk the cow, if youre lucky youll get an awp skin. or a knife model. in that case, you can quit your job and lay back.",2
"i dont remember why i stopped playing counter-strike1.6 but im immediately back at home in cs:go. competitive games in perfect scenario: - driven by tactics - team cooperation - positioning - timing - even individual heroics that can change the round. competitive games in bad scenario: - if you are unlucky you will get a group of screaming flamers. - this is a great way to lose all confidence you had in yourself and the confidence in your team. - after all the screaming they decide to surrender. if you can handle both scenarios this game is for you :) fyi.. if you are new in cs most of the players will show no signs of mercy (deal with it). 10/10",3
"this game is awesome to play, but no competitive, its full of russians who have boosted accounts and they speak only in russian.",5
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",1
"awesome game , good for fps (first person shooter) gamer and also have awesome skins for all weapons. really recommend this game for fps lover , try it :d 10/10",7
"best fps in steam so far...currently most played fps worldwide. nice graphic, stunning performance, and doesnt require any high-end pc to play .... last but the most important : nice ping (tested from indonesia)",10
