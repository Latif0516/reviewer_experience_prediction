"ofc!!! why not kill some black terrorist thats so yummii",2
"counter strike: global offensive stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety. valve has not only updated the shooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries. this is counter-strike, whatever the format you choose to play it on, and there isnt a higher recommendation than that.",1

"pretty good version of cs, def better than source! recommend highly!",4
"in this game you play as john counterstrike a white man who has had his freedom soiled by brown people. being on a angry rampage against allah you shot the brown people. the game has great characters which a portayed accuratly like the angry russains charactrs are spot on. the story fluxuates as john counterstrike loses matches and wins. this story was so emotionaly ahead of its time i curled up and cried for three weeks after john counterstrikes wife gold nova 3 was lost and he got stuck with gold nova 2. 10/10 would curl up to cry for three weeks again.",2
"this game has a p90 in it. i swear i feel like i am getting owned by little cod kids everytime they spray my head from 1000000000000000000 inches away. other than that its good to go. 9/10",3

"i am the 1% that plays this game casually im ready for the hate because apparently this makes you a bad person these days lol its still fun, though",1
"honestly some of the most fun ive had in an fps. although it comes with its faults and is not fully balanced quite yet, it is still an incredible game that only becomes more fun as you play more and more.",2
"counter-strike: global offensive (cs: go) will expand upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 12 years ago. cs: go features new maps, characters, and weapons and delivers updated versions of the classic cs content (de_dust, etc.).",2
"this game is very good, not much more to say its a classic.",1
"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",4
"ive played like 80 hours this week... lord help me.",2
"this game is good in many ways as long as you have a good computer and play with the right people, because sometimes, or most of the time, when you play with someone that is really good and competitive or play with the wrong people, things can get rough and unique, yet harsh, vocabularies from their mouth would hurt people verbally.",1
"coming from 1.6 and css, this game is far the best one produced by valve. im glad valve are giving out regular updates and actualy supporting the esports scene. word of warning with match making, there can be times where you are playing against people who are cheating to either grief or boost other players. overall a good fps game, best on the market atm for muliplay base.",3
"u like call of battlefield: halo edition? well 2 bad 4 u scrub u cant run and shoot a! u think ur usain bolt? m8 suck it up, sit down, an use dat bolt properly. u think u can spray? a u think ur jackson pollok? lol ul be scrubbin that spray off the walls of dust 2, cos u miss so much!!!1 /end meme",2
"good game that is fun to play strategically with friends. however, do not, and i repeat.. do not buy any cases/keys expecting to get a knife skin. all you will gain is misery and regret. you will find yourself addicted to opening cases and you will often find yourself saying, just one more case. im bound to get a knife eventually. you wont get a knife unless youre super lucky or youre gabens nephew or something. gg caseopenings... gg",2
"point and shoot many blood spatters not many kills",4

"10/10, get killed by a dude with an awp that was jumping and 360 noscoped wallbanged me through 3 walls.",3
"very fun game, with a lot of teamwork required. skill cap is very high and is fun to play casual or competetive. =d best first person shooter on steam for sure!",4
"good game with many strengths and weaknesses. (based on my own opinion) either you dont play it after buying it, or you will end up playing it for a ton of hours.",4
"if youre not already playing it religiously, you should. cs:go is the best damn game available on the pc right now. i know, its sad that nothing can compete with counter-strike for over 12 years now, but thats the way it is. you dont want to be some kind of a scrub whos bad at competitive online games, right? theyll call you a n00b and a scrub and make fun of you if you dont get good at this game. so stop wasting your time playing casual garbage and pick up this game right now.",5
"not a bad game once you get used to it.. and can be quite fun with friends",1
"game plays great on 128 tick. hit or miss with matchmaking 66, but still pretty damn good for a free service.",5
"never expected this game to help me learn russian polish and french. gr8 game my friend  blyat",3
"amazing game.. crazy graphics compared to 1.6 must play value for money =)",1
"reason #1 why so much people dont get past silver 5: russians. valve please, give them their own server and ban them from being able to matchmake with the rest of europe since they dont speak a international language and dont know  about team tactics.",2
"hard if you have never played a counter strike game but still alot of fun",2
"i love this game but ... i hate hackers and cheaters and this game is full of these sh*t",3
"good game, sharp learning curve, competitive aspect is probably one of the best alongside lol, dota. casuals tend to be somewhat cancer with low rank players who mic spam and flame. however most people arent cancerous. nice community. every 3-4 games you will run into a hacker in competitive, and in the higher ranks of eagle + every 1-2 games you might have a hacker. sometimes you will run into toxic players, flaming you for small things, mute them and go on with life. many players in competitive games are toxic you dont have to deal with that person for an hour so mute him. tl;dr good game, good community except some toxic people, fun and competitive.",2
"amazing game. unfortunately too many morons playing mm",3
"best pc fps currently being updated. has a great community. just an all around great game.",2
"every case i open is either a galil or a bizon. 10/10",2

"stat trak redline is love, stat trak redline is life",2
"this game is truly a must own for any of you fps junkies out there. if you havent played counter-strike before- dont worry! this game is beginner friendly and the ui and menus are easy to navigate. joining a match is effortless and the game just never gets boring. fantastic!",2
"this is an amazing 1st person shooter. it is incredibly fun and addictive to play offline or online with friends.",1
"the best frist person shooter, buy the game if you like fps.",1
"beast, i have played over 6 months, started at silver one, now im dmg working at eagle. its fun to play with friends. i pray you will like it as much as i do. amen.",4
"9/10 would buy great game for most people (and yes me)",3
"csgo in many words -smurfs -hackers -overwatch (people getting banned for nothing), [ my freind got accused of hacking at silver 2 and his score is to low to get accused of hacking] -get stuck at the same rank forever (dmg) -need better servers -need better hit reg -offends the rest of the series -matach making cooldowns to long -match making (finding people), [ i was in a game with super low ranks while i was dmg] -yet somewhat addictive",3
"this game needs no introduction... started back in 1999 as mod, and now here we are. i brought this game on lauched date, and hooked up for hours. all the originals maps from cs:1.6 are got new add ons, some extra passages and a beautiful whole new look. steam workshop: its really awesome with user created maps and custom textures for guns. main plus point of cs:go is its graphics is improved compared to cs 1.6, though not quite as upto mark with cod or bf series. if you are a true fps gamer, you must buy this game and kill few hours of your life.",1
"great fps game, can be played using lower rig pc and still get high frames. big learning curve for those who never played counter-strike before",2
"wasted 2$ on a key and uncrated. 10/10 would play again",4
"very fun to play when you get used to the mechanics! its a bit difficult at the beginning but still very fun :d",5
"smurfing and surfing. damage taken from cave mite - 99 in 5 hits 3 b? lets go b. awp b? lets go b. welcome to silver mm strats. we will now rush lower with poopoo bizawns since were all from the team teetawn.",3
"great fun to play with the mates and compete with them. with different match making ranks its alot more fun not like call of duty when you play with pros and sometimes the people can be ok unless you bring out the auto sniper",1
"a good game to play.. many modes that player can play like deathmatch, arm race, casual, etc..",2
"in a world where no matter where you point your gun, your still going to miss",2
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",1
"nothing is as good as cs 1.6 but this definitely beats cs:source",3
"need more skin drops tho. and more quality in case openings lel",2
"counter strike gloabal offensive is one of the best multiplayer games till date..(y).a must play.. the game is not story driven..we chose between the cts and the terrorists..and complete objectives according to the chosen side..we can play the game offline with bots or multiplayer with friends...the graphics are awesome...the only thing that cs 1.6 lacked!!..",1
"eventually you just cant resist opening them damn cases,",1
"such an awesome game, mostly fun if played with friends.",1
"nothing like call of duty! if you like a great competive game then this is for you!",1
"it is a really cool game, and i play it a often as i can, it is just such a shame that the game is full of cheaters.",3
"boom click headshot all day every day. thats how you instant win.",5
"got reported for hacking because i had 60 kills and 40 deaths 420/21 would get reported again.",1
"*open case want m4 asiimov* *sees stattrak asiimov* *gaben blesses you with a stattrak pp bizon*",2
"this is a great game that takes a lot more skill than other fps games.",2
"full on spray at point blank = you die and only give them 95 damage in 3 hits getting the drop on the enemy and getting a headshot = they do a 180 and headshot you immediately and you only give them 95 damage in 3 hits taking a pot shot half way across the map while running away = your first kill what.",2
"some guy was talking about how he had all kinds of cancers and he wanted donations. he was a funny sarcastic guy. i tried to friend him. he didnt accept. 10/10",1
"csgo has been the epitomy of a developer supported title and should set a precedent for many games in the future. valve has done an incredible job of not only listening to the community, but implementing good ideas on a respectable time table (an update was made less than 48 hours after a user suggestion with his improvement implemented in that update for example). csgo is a fun and addictive game with a high skill-ceiling, competitive community, crowd funded tournaments, and an addictive weapon skin system, that again - can be fueled and improved by the community. this is a must have title for the competitive minded gamer. the only negative that comes to mind regarding counter strike global offensive is the amount of cheaters at higher levels in competitive matchmaking. although valve has introducted both vac and overwatch, there is still little being done at the current moment, but im hopeful for a fix to be introduced soon.",2
"i ing hate this game. no other game has provided me with the upmost anger and irritation than this piece of . alas i keep coming back for more due to some sick, masochistic spell this game casts over all who dare venture into its depths.",1
"best action + aim game ever! but hackers made this game ! too much hacker! cant even have a single match without hackers! valve please fix this",3
"spend 400$ on a fake knife so you can go around being useless and just inspecting it all game. 10/10",1
"10/10 best game 2014 even though it came out ages ago but yh would buy eu 2014 gg wp",2
"fix the hacks and its best game ever , make a new discount :p",3
"makes you hate every other country around yours with people who speak another language and turns you into a racist muddafukka. 20/10 would buy twice for a better world.",4
"one of the best games on steam, perfect fps, graphics and pretty nuch everything!",1
"i used to play swat 4 for 7 years and i struggled a lot to find a replacement for it, until i finally tried this game and i completly fell in love with it since the first day! what can i say more... if youre a person that likes to be challenged day by day, this game is clearly for you!",2
"this is my really good review for corner-strike: global offensive content i once watched this corner for so long, i swear i saw it vibrate now i gotta buy a new skin for my corner, because wallpapers arent free and i am an upstanding citizen god bless the corner-terrorists",1
"actually takes skill so i should stay the hell away.",1
"this game is easily my favorite game right now. the amount of teamwork needed to do well is really astounding, and its really fun. id recommend this game to anyone.",4
"favourite game of recent, played 400 hours and still is not getting old great game!",3
"for everyone that has bought this game and is playing it constantly learn to in aim, goddammit man.",4
"came into a game and got killed 10/10 would do again",1
"the latest installment of the best multiplayer fps ever.",1
"this game made me lose all of my friends, my mom kicked me out of the house, and now im sleeping outside a starbucks joint with  wifi in a tent. but it was all worth it, i finally got a purple weapon 10/10",1
"perhaps one of the highest skill cap fps games on the market today, the counter-strike series is still going strong. ive always loved counter-strike and this doesnt disappoint.",1
"awesome! fun to get new skins fun to unlock crates and absolutley jaw dropping gameplay!",1
"literally the worst fps ive ever played pretty much cod but slower and harder to kill things 0/10 uninstalled",1
"first time : 0 kill 25 deaths 20/10 best rage simulator ever",2
"one of the best fps ever! nice graphics, strategy, skill and a harsh community!",1
"great game! awesome graphics/great connection/ and awesome guns i love it worth the price!",1
"pretty good game, really nice fps and the best thing since 1.6!",1
"extremely fun game. very addictive and the matchmaking is quite cool. dont enjoy the ranking system tomuch and ive saw the fairshare of hackers in matchmaking. what happend to good old css scrims etc.. but apart from that alot of great people to meet and is fun to play! :)",2
"rage simulator is possibly one of the best games i have ever played no doubt about it. its just that great go on rip your hair out go get the game now!",1
"would i recommend this game to anyone? uhhhh duh i say its a mistake to even think about not getting this game. it takes fps titles to a whole other level with its own built in competetive system known as matchmaking which makes sure you are being put with other players within your skill level so that your match is not too easy or difficult. so yeah... i recommend it.",1
"fantastic buy, i myself though this would be boring as its a pc shooter but i was proven wrong! easy to play with a mouse and keyboard, isnt a game that demands a high end pc which is awesome! games are really easy to get into and even if you cant be bothered to play online then try the offline bots its a hell of alot of fun! loads of gorgeous maps to download for free! and loads of different skins and guns to download! basically what im saying is its a must buy! although i have only player for 4 hours, i can sommenly say i will be playing again very very soon! so what you waiting for?!? try it :) +happy gaming+",1
"terrorism is now rising on the global scale and now is time to go on the offensive and stike back.",1
"good game , nice graphics and the gameplay its excellent but the hackers since the game was like 2 euros i see hackers everywhere on competitive ,bleah, i hope that valve will ing fix this . for now i dont recomand the game",2
"horrible game. i joined a game of arms race but everyone was still running around on their legs. ruined an otherwise great game for me. 3/10 for the pretty pictures.",1
"i really love this game :d new era for counter strike",3
"worst game ever 0/10 would not recommend. played it for 5 minutes, never tried it again.",5
"its a good game. its much harder to pick up than any other shooter because of its mechanics. this isnt really a bad thing, as youll get used to it eventually and it makes it even more fun to get kills (especially headshots) because of its difficulty. the community in this game isnt really the best, as most of the players playing in competetive are people who wont cooperate and russians. this makes it really heard to communicate with your team you might have been matched with in the competetive gamemode. so having somebody you know to play competetive with is much better and easier as teamwork is necessary for winning this game. other than that i must say that most weapons here are very well balanced because of how the money system works. if i would have the option to change one thing in this game it would be to make competetive (or just generally all valve servers) 128 tick, as it would make the game more based on how well you play and less on whos the most lucky in a gunfight.",5
"if russia has to do a census, they just have to play some matchmaking.",3
"this game is awesome.counter strike 1.6 has gone old now.cs go has much scope and we will be seeing many tournaments specially being organised on this game.i will advise to all my frnds to spend that 600-700 rupees for this game as it is worth it if u have a good moderate config cpu.you should be able to get 80-100 stable fps in this game as it runs on this fps really smoothly.now coming to the in game graphics and models.they are awesome ..valve has put much thought into it.even it has a new drop system and various gun skins that you can get by playing.it also features a special ranking system which i think is not really good.it is similar to the ranking used in chess games.it gives us a rank on the basis of our win/loose ratio in competive/clan matchmaking.it also finds a server for us when we need it in accordance to our maximum acceptible ping.thats it i have about the game. ^^^thanks for reading this review^^^ regards :- deepak king singh",5
"i think it is a really good game if you are into fps and competition",1
"ing start playing some error  come up okay i start sliding around like ice skating then i get a 24 hour cooldown for no reason i wait the cooldown play comp start play plus its a money waster put in 10$ worth of keys unbox and get 5c wepons in return  you gaben you do nothing to help with these ing errors!",2
"best game ever ...condition is and 1.6 were great ...csgo is not far behind .... much better then source :-)",3
"such a good fps, especially when you play competitive.",1
"very good fps. you need a lot of teamwork to win a game. game is not too expensive and its absolutely worth its price since you can make it up by selling in game items.",2
"fantastic game for beginners and pros alike, well worth buying.",1
"everything is good in this game. seriously, buy it.",2
"pretty good game. mic problems on mac still not resolved!!",3
"counter-strike: go doesnt fail to please me. its a great competitive game with new guns, new modes, better graphics, and a gy community, thats pretty much the only downside... but cs:go is a very well made competitive game. but if you are me, you would prefer css over this game. but both are spectacular games. thank you once again, valve :)",1
"i have played this game a ton, everyday 8 hours. this game has a huge skill gap, but once you fill some of it in by learning the maps, map awareness, aiming for the head, and everything else. this game is very addicting also, and almost never gets old!",2
"reasons to buy it: 1.really good graphics. 2.good design. 3.doesnt reqire that good gpu. 4.you can get steam wallet money from it. :)",3
"when my mom asks me what im doing today, i simply say cs go. its not a game, its a lifestyle. 10/10, 5 stars",1
"this is one of the only shooters with proper rules and strategy",1
"awesome game where i found bunch of friends around the world",1
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",1
"10/10 would learn russian to understand sound 5/5 graphics 420/420 would meth with some blaze good game, if only walter was here... !",2
"this is a good game but some players are so stupid...",1
"its like a point and click adventure but the adventure is a bullet going through someones head. 10/10 ign",2
"its a game about being yelled at by your teammates for not killing all five enemies when youre the only one left and the bomb is going to explode in 5 seconds. 10/10.",2
"everything is ok but only some little bugs and sometimes i try to start cs:go like now it starts and give me a black screen and close automaticly...",2
"definitely much more better than css, and certainly not worse than classic 1.6. p.s. haters gonna hate. yep",1
"best multiplayer game i ever played. good job valve.",2
"great game where you can trade, unlock camos, and play with your friends on competitive mode. over all great game!",2
"amazing game! really enjoy the concept and the matchmaking. the counter strike series has been truly quite amazing keep it up!",3
"its counter strike, what else is there to say? :)",1
"counter-strike: global offensive is what a fps should be. this has to be the best skill-based fps on the market. the guns feel powerful and rewarding, and the addition of camos is great. the only problem with the game is the difficulty. the game is played competively, and a good amount of the players on it have been playing counter-strike since the beginning are godlike. so the game has a bit of a learing curve in the respect that it takes practice to be able to compete against some of the other players. but once you are to that point, this game is extremely rewarding. getting a kill in this game is so much more satisfying than any other fps ive played, mainly because getting kills arent easy. all in all, counter-strike: global offensive is a must have for any fps fan due to the rewarding gunplay, great map design, and large community as soon as you overcome the learning curve.",3
"you spend more money on weapon skins than the game itself to impress people you hate. chickens explode if you knife them 9/11",3
"competitive, enjoyable, but above all else, ing frusterating. join in and rank up while having a blast with all your buds. that is, if you win of course :d",4
"who doesnt like shooting stuff especially other people.",2
"rage simulator 101. with the occasional aimbots/triggerbots and wallhacks. also with cosmetic market transactions that cost more than real life things. 10/10 valve. will buy this again.",4
"bs-new update can suckmahdeek, always lagg, takes forever to find a match in competetive",2
"great game! high skill cap and based around competitive play. 10/10",4
"a solid platformer that brings donkey kong and friends back into modern gaming but i wish they put the crocodiles in somewhere",1
"this is all about accuracy, strategy and teamwork. you are good with those, you are the master of fps. totally worth the fun!",3
"the best fps out there fun, full of action. boom headsshot!!!",1
"great gane i love it even when their are alot of hackers in my games :|",2
"one of my favorite games of all times! this is fun going solo in a team deathmatch, doing a team in competitive, even just going against bots is fun! its hard to get used to, but super fun when you learn how to play!",3
"this is such a tactical and an amazing game! i really recommend you guys and gals to get this :3",2
"fun game, very entertaining, i like it better than css. i truly love this game.",1
"great fps game that takes a lot of skill to master but the reward is fantastic. killing another player is so satisfying because you know you have to work for every kill. highly recommended.",1
"power? money? terrorists? money? power? plain-old death? if you like any of these buy this addictive game for the power-hungry! can you control the map and kill the last of those stupid french poeple?",1
"game is very enjoyable, fast paced, but very hard to learn all up amazing game",2
"ive put over 500$ into this game, it has given me sleepless nights, suicidal thoughts, and has made me blurt horrible profanity towards the other players. has nearly ruined my like but you know what who cares ive got 11,000 dollars screw it im getting a knife even if i go insane. !0/10 5 stars fully recommend this game.",4
"very great game, but i dont like the people in it. their kinda mean and things,when you see a 12 years old they all start callin him bad words, wich is like really annoying but overall best game ever, really should buy it if you dont have it.",2
"honestly i like it better than source, but thats my opinion :p",2
"another solid installement in counter strike serie. takes whats best from 1.6 and source and makes a solid foundation for esports scene for years to come. a must buy.",1
"i like this game. i would suggest you play it too.",2
"this game is timewasting,moneywasting and is possibly the worst fps i have ever played. i had huge hype for this but as soon as i got my knife the game just got to simple i decided to start on competitive and i must say it was enjoyable and suprisingly really easy.... 4/10 nice up.",2
"i love this game! it nice graphics and good sound. true, there are a few drawbacks that are worth noting: -1. this shooting, she used to be better and more responsive, why? can not explain, you just feel it. -2. matchmaking system. you play or weak opponents, or with very strong players of his level is very difficult to meet. -3. not my favorite mp5. instead, some scrap (mp7) which does not want to play. im sure that statistically this is not the most popular weapon. and please take a look and appreciate my work in the workshop! i hope very much for your support!",4
"dust2 all day, every day. rushing long, smoking mid.",2
"if youve ever been a fan of shooters, this is one you dont want to pass up. cheap, easy to learn, simple to jump into a match. a classic come back to life!",1
"a counter-strike game that doesnt require hardcore skill to play it like 1.6 did, and that makes it more fun and more friendly for new players. graphics are very good, its easier to seperate ct from tt and radar is made much more helpful. this game makes you to come back to it again and again. even if you got bored from it, after few days you can play it like first you started it. there is a great value in it, so thumbs up!",2
"you will die plenty of times. but you will get hooked.",1
"good game i like the gun games with the guns and the guns change and you get other guns",2
"bought game played game got killed by a russian kicked the russian got banned 5/5 would play again if werent banned for 7 days.",4
"spent a lot of time playing this recently. competitive matchmaking lets you play challenging matches that are generally fairly even, and the multiple casual modes let you play fun games with friends.",2
"guranteed you will be stuck in silver ranks forever i made it out of silver... somehow",2
"counter-strike: global offensive is game that plei erry day u kno",3
"great game, playing with friends makes the gameplay experience even better, and like most shooter games, takes some time and tweaking controls to get it just right",1
"this game is fun to play, and takes alot of skill to master and therefore consumes alot of time. csgo is cheaper than alot of fps games (cod & battlefield) and in my opinion i get alot more out of this game.",2

"there arent enough words to accurately describe the greatness of this game. a must, must-have for any pc-gamer. a lot/10",1
"game is good, i like the game. game is good to play. its good game",3
"this is by far the most popular competetive fps, which is around for many years, counting from the release of original cs. the graphics in this game are amazing, but you will play on low to get the most frames for serious play, casual players are also very catered and will have fun in this game after a week of learning how to shoot because this game is totally different from others and has recoil and spread mechanics like you would encounter in real life. the sound is not as good as in previous games, meaning it will be harder to detect footsteps position, but it is still enjoyable. the matchmaking is the biggest and only downfall in this game, a lot of times (30%) you will get faced against too hard or too easy opponents. overall 9/10, buy this game, i would not be sorry even if it was 60 usd like other games around, i would rather spend it on cs:go than stupid cod games.",1
"i have many feeling for this game, i love it but yet hate it. i will start off with the hates, one of the main things about this game are the prices of in-game items. such as keys for example. i personally think that these keys are way too much. really? $2.50 a piece? that crazy, now the cases, those are different story. cases are pretty decently even with price wise. 10 cents to around 50 cents at the max. but keys, its like paying for a gallon of a gas a key. now for the good side of what i think of this game. i love this first person shooter/ competive/team work game. its action packed, gets your heart pumping, and is alot of fun. but one thing i do wish valve does in the future is that they decrease the price of their items. its insane, my rating: 9/10",4
"fantastic game to play with friends. gets pretty, intense, but very fun. love the skins and gameplay, but there arent a lot of gun variety. some guns are used more often and are way more overpowered than other guns. other than that, i would definitely reccomend this game.",2

"awesome game if no ones torrenting porn on your wifi. 11/10",2
"so you think it gets more realistic with time, but no, not here. exactly the same as the first counter strike where your opponents bunny hop, and intrude so unrealistically that this game really isnt a far cry from half-life deathmatch: source.",1
"never played counter strike before and i love this game. its a very fun game and the graphics are pretty nice too.",2
"good game to play in between call of duty releases. a good warm up to get to the real game.",1

"this game is nothing like team fortress 2 it takes skill hard-work. i recommend this game to those that love challenges and the bigger rewards at the end. if i were to not play or enjoy team fortress 2 or quit it i will definitely go this game. 8.5/10",3
"great fps game propably one of the best i know of, this is much better than css.",2

"great game, nice community depending on the game, loving competitive! overall a great addition to the cs series!",1
"hard game for beginners but eventually its fun. this is the first fps game ive played that demands careful shots thanks to recoil than bullet spamming enemies once theyre in your crosshair. the bullet penetration adds the real-world flavour and theres even a warmup round for shooting just about anywhere even that filthy hostage if youre on terrorist side. 10/10 would recommend for challenge-seeking/competitive gamers mostly but not so for the easy-going casual fps gamers who prefer continuous bullet spam.",1
"awesome weapon skins and maps. many new features. maps are remade and enhanced. enjoyed playing this a lot",1

"css was my favourite been playing since the first counter strike. this game is awesome i use to play the beta and put in like 300+ hours. then i stopped playing for a while because all my stats got reset. this game is deffinatly worth getting even for $15. most valve games are great!. 8/10 great graphics , way better than css and the sounds are improved heaps.",2
"its a good game, i play it a lot but im still pretty bad at it",4

"do not buy this game , i am putting this in the reccomended section because steam odesnt show the bad comments. you will get banned from steam for no reason for playing this game and it will all be a big waiste of time. i am not able to trade any items or play with friends because they banned me for no reason. if you are reading this just dont even play any steam games, after paying for a game i bought with my own money i am unable to even play because i am banned from the game.i am currently working on a plan to sue steam for alot more than they will be able to afford if i dont get my account back.",1
"good game but! if you dont have a knife you suck :(",1
"this game has its positive points and negative points. its one of the best competitive games on the pc in my oppinion though. it feels great when you play, its made on quite an old engine, so a lot of pcs can run it. i could even run it with my old laptop on a smooth 60+ fps. matchmaking requires a lot of skill, which is why they added skill groups to the game just to prevent you matching with/against people whore not equally skilled as youre. i like a lot about the mm system but theres still a lot to improve. as a lot of the cs:go players know if theyve been playing for a long time, theres a lot of cheaters and smurfs in both lower skillgroups as in global elite (highest skillgroup in the game). this makes people rage and quit matchmaking and search for alternatives like faceit, esea, cevo etc.. i wish cs:go/valve made their vac system as good as the one on esea, thisll make the game more enjoyable. overall, i really do like this game and its definetly a game i would recommend.",2
"best game i have played in ages this is a must buy to a must play",1
"no dont get me wrong this is a nice game, ill admit im not the most avid csgo player but im learning. the problem however is based on the community as a result of all the skins and knifes in the game. the second you buy this game you will get pestered with the bots that want to steal from you, it basically comes down to if their profile is private them block them and or report them. the community of this game is pretty toxic as well which i dont like, i feel as if this game has been ruined by the silly actions of people. dont fall into the skins rubbish its a massive cash grab.",1
"cs:go (counter - strike global offensive) its a very good game ! this has what every man wants fascinated action, teamwork, accuracy and more skill. the best communities containing server for this game are indungi ,freakz,astramania,gladiators etc. i recommend this game! ;) tzutzix ! ;)",2
"this is an outstanding game to play with friends for a fun time. there is also the everlasting addiction to skins in game, as well as your opportunity to play csgo competitively.",3
"there is call of duty, which has homophobic 12 year olds that rage at you at your lack of skill then there is cs:go, which has homophobic 20 year olds that rage at you for your lack of skill and weapon skins",1

"this game is really fun i have fun with the gun and play yes",3
"oiya you got to understand this is a skill shooter where people strive to get better not a run and gun explosion thing its about knowing what to do and being tactical about it. 10/10 just for those clutch situations and hack acquisations",2
"counter strike global offensive is a... lets face it, if you dont know what this is you need to climb out from under that rock. cs:go (as its often abbreviated to) is rewarding to those with skill, and punishing to the casual gamer when played in competitive mode. to get the best of out this game you need to invest time and effort to learn the maps and the spray patterns of the guns. watching players with high levels of skill is like watching a football match on tv. even if you dont like the game you appreciate people who have skill at this game because you can clearly see when a player knows their stuff and when they dont. this game is more of a sport hence its overwhelming appearances in esports tournaments like esl and dreamhack etc. overall if you are looking for a bit of fun for an hour or so, stay away from this game! to get the best from this, you need the practice regularly and get a team of people to play with, then... its brilliant.",2

"great game!!! slaughter is the best medicine! ha haha hahahahaha!!!",1
"this game is a quality first person shooter where you have to either plant the bomb (if you are playing on the terroist team) or defuse the bomb and stop the terroists (if you are plaing for counter terroist team) it is extreamly good value for money!! there are some curent bugs valve need fix but im sure they will be delt with soon. warning you may get addicted to buying things called crates in this game hope this hellped - -------------------------------------------------- magic malcom",2

"major overhall of css graphical updates and way more weapons, i dont know anyone who wouldnt want to play this game, works on the even worst pcs like mine",1
"this is way better than 1.6 or source. both 1.6 and source are full of hackers, this one has too, but less. go also adds molotovs and decoys which is pretty cool. this version also has much better graphics and improved maps, which keeps me playing even more, because graphics do matter. gameplay stays faithful to the original 1.6, which is really great because theres lots of 1.6 players that moved on to this version. it also runs great on old hardware. rating: 9/10 if there were less hackers, it would be 10.

"one of the best games i have played. this is one of the first games i have played on my pc, ever since i joined steam. there are so many things to do to pass time in the game, such as surfing. competitive is one my favorite things about the game, it allows for team communication and co-ordination. also, opening cases have been the death of me, i have opened at least 50 of cases and nothing good, but that wontt stop me from opening them and getting the infamous butterfly knife. this game helped me get better at pc games as i was a cod player on console. this game will never get old, and ill never stop playing it. on the other hand, it does have problems in the community such as smurfs and hackers, but hopefully, they will try and remove this to keep the game fair. furthermore, this is the most played game i have on my library. i would definitely recommend this to anyone whether they are good at fps or starting on pc games. this game gets 10/10 on my book.",2

"keeps the classic feel of counter-strike while bringing in the new generation of graphics. great game. some changes are good such as new guns, balancing of certain maps and matchmaking system. no bad changes seen besides the small learning curve to relearn some maps changes, and a few new guns.",3

"this game is complete . but you will learn to love it <3",1
"love this game very competitive and fun. only bad thing would be most of the time the community is very hatefull.",2
"a great addictive, competitive shooter that we all know and love... the thing is, when you buy this game, with it comes originality, you can customize your weapons to the max. but the thing that separates cs:go from cod, bf4,3..., and other, is the core mechanics of the strategic gameplay it-self. but lately they lost their mojo for this game and did some odd things to it. but it pulls through, and stays a terific game... all-around, an awesome strategic fps.! :d",3
"if this game were a food, it would give you diabetes. 7 days/10, would cooldown again, thumbs up if youre playing in 2015, like if real life brought you here.",1
"one of the best multiplayer experiences on pc. ive tried the likes of battlefield 3 and had painful experience online, but cs:go works every single time. mines a 2 mbps connection which goes down to 512 kbps at times and there never is a lag... i was a big fan of the original cs 1.6 and never thought there could be anything simpler and / or better than that, i am glad i was wrong! super like!!!!",1
"lovely game, or so it was. the game was excellent with amazing an unique game styles compared to cod or bf. it was an addicting game until the smurfs, hackers and griefers/trolls came about. now csgo is a cluster of 1 team filled with idiots and that 1 try hard guy on the team while the other is a full-on hacker/smurf. sure is it fun to have a smurf on your team but the other team wont. what point is there to the game if someone else plays for you? overall the game is unique and fun but the s who smurf, hack or troll pushes this game down.",2

"spent $10 for the game, shelled out $250 for skins. 10/10 would bang.",2
"a very well balanced successor to cs:s with a graphics overhaul.",2
"cs go... where to start... this game has a lot of great and a lot of bad stuff. i will not deny any of the problems cs go has... for example the tick rates and bad community. but the game has a lot of good stuff aswell and tries somewhat to keep the old cs running. i would rather play cs:s tho but cs go has better popularity and competative match making. this game is like 50/50 when it comes to skill and luck. if you keep your crosshair on someones head from a long distance and just one taps theres a 50/50 that you hit or miss because the game did not register the shot. 128 tick might make this like 80/20 or 90/10 that you will hit but still  when you compare to the older versions of cs history. i think this game is worth it tho. you can play this game for days without end and still have lots of fun if you play with your friends. i recommend you to get a team of some sort and play your way up in ranks.. best way.",3

"it used to be my favorite game! but now you can just try try and try very hard. but you will keep loosing and more and more people are using hacks. vac does not detect them as they are sophisticated programs. whats the point. unless this is addressed along with a huge list of other bugs.. its just you trying your best to no avail. go ahead and keep tyring but hackers are wining. this applies to the match making and competetive play more than it does to casual. but you have hackers in casual as well. so sadly this negative review.. changed from a previous positive one. :(",5

"a lot of people play csgo hard, and attempt to perfect the angles and tricks for each map. the game tends to be very repetitive in the competitive scene. the skill cap is very high, and could take years to reach the top level of gameplay.",1

"as a former 1.6 player, moving to cs:go was rather hard. the gameplay is changed, surprisingly not for the worst. at first i was disgusted by the game. slowly, i started liking it more and more. the only problem is with the player models, as they are hard to spot in some places on the map. overall, a refreshing experience and the best thing that ever happened was introducing the competitive matchmaking.",2

"the first fps game i really play for hours on end. the classic feel of counter-strike 1.6 is flowing through the game, but it looks very modern and up to date. it would be false compare if it was up againts titles like call of duty or battelfield, because it isnt the same playstyle. a perfect game with an active community, lots of updates and seasonal extras. 10/10 (what were you expecting? its counter-strike)",1
"great game but has a verry immature community some times you luck out with good groups. and for all the people haveing downloading issues that sooo many people have one of the best ways to solve this is opt out of steam betas uninstall steam make sure to back up your games in the common follder delete all cs:go data install steam resart your computer then install steam restart your computer once again and install sc:go works some times not every time and can be a pain but it seemed to prevent the corupt downloads also downloading during off hours is best",1

"i bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. after exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, i realized their population was growing too large. the chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. i knew what had to be done. i bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called peta. i listened to in the arms of an angel in my microsoft professional deluxe gaming chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, i decided to take matters into my own hands. i loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. i cried harder that night than i have ever before",1
"this game was a 4/10 untill i discovered the chickens.. i gave it 6/10 because i like the chickens.. i played on inferno and i met more chickens, now i rate it 8/10",1
"super fun to play, but as a third person shooter it fails to derive from the standard formula of its genre.",1
"and yet another game that valve ruined with micro-transactions. boxes, skins, this  shouldnt be for sale. when did we ever pay for mods? for any game out there, look at skyrim: hundreds of thousands of mods were created for it, nobody is asking you to pay them money to use their mods or skins. this is disgusting money grabbing tactic that valve, is getting fat off. the more money and time you spend, the more addicted you become. because now, that you have invested in to this game, you cant stop. as a psychology student i can tell you, this is a very, very ruthless and dirty trick to play on someone. and they are using it to collect money from millions of users...this is unspeakable.",1
"death is a great teacher. failure in counter-strike: global offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldnt have done, and how you could have done better. counter-strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. growth is an important factor in global offensive, especially if youre coming into counter-strike fresh or after a sabbatical. this is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. if youre a call of duty player, youre going to need to change your play style to succeed here. counter-strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what its always done best. global offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.",2

"the best game i have ever played. takes skill which is why cod players dont recomend it. the skin system is very nice but very expensive. and the ranking system isnt too hot either but it is very fun and me and my friends enjoy it",3
"its a very nive game but there are too much hackers.",2
"counter strike: global offensive (otherwise known as cs:go) is the newest game in the counter strike series. since ive already done a review of counter strike: source, im just going to talk about the many gameplay changes that go introduces to the series. firstly, the guns all have more kick to them, making run-n-gun players hugely greivanced. the guns all feel authentic and sound amazing, but i personally dont enjoy using the snipers and i cant stand the heavy weapons (i.e. miniguns). the weight of each gun has been pretty drastically increased, leaving slower and more methodical gameplay in its path. if you remember cs:s, there a probably 2 things you noticed: 1. there were very few shotguns, and 2. there were only two grenade types. well, in go, there are now 5 types of shotgun, and 4 different types of grenades! i personally believe is the best game in the counter strike series, and its methodical gameplay makes for a difficult experience, for both newcomers, and seasoned veterans.",1
"great game, competitive, fun, frustrating, challenging, addictive.",1
"no other shooter can shake a stick at the one and only classic cs experience, not cod, not bf. a game, where you not only need a fast hand and good eyes, but solid strategy as well.",1
"counter-knife: global trade is the best knife-collecting sim out there i r8 8/8 m8 its gr8",2
"always a reliable game to tend to any kind of gamer. with casual and competitive options, youll feel right at home.",1
"according to my point of view the best functioning und balanced online-competitive fps-shooter with a creative community, that always is integrating their content into the game. thats what makes cs:go so special, it is developing all the time. recommendable without any concerns!",4
"the revival the counter-strike series needed. great game, and thankfully now focussed around growing the competive community.",4
"a great game if you like playing competively and with friends also with the ability to have different kinds of weapons and collectable skins for trading.as a owner of all the the counter-strikes this is hands down my favorite one.",1
"cs:go is a fast paced action game with many modes, many skins, many knives, and alot of competitive players trying to go for the top of the hill. back when i was involved in the beta, there were few players that i knew, but alot of great enhancments from 1.6 and source. it did take a while to get used to the new engine, but as i progressed into the game, i got used to the new hitboxes. the arms deal update - this update introduced new ways to customize your weapons with different items from either map packs, collections, or tournament events. trying to get the rarest can sometimes get easy or rare, cheap or expensive. knives are hard to get, but also are some of the covert rifles. why do i enjoy this game? i am able to play with many other players of similar skill and more of the updates are helping making this game alot better with the reddit community having a voice.",2
"awesome game, excellent online experience! the most addictive part of the game is the weapon skin trading. thanks to this you make many new friends and have a lot of fun! global gaming is certainly not missing, there are people all around the world playing cs:go! only downside of this game is the unfair ranking system.",2
"i like this game but tbh im just making this review for the badge xd",3
"csgo is the best frist person shooter you do or will play. resons for that it isnt to much, what i mean by that is there isnt 100 diffrent wepons that are each special in there own way like in battlefield. overall this game if it were underwear you would wear this underwear for weeks then wash it then put it back on. :)",1
"great game. it is a different kind of fps and i love it. 10/10 would suck  to buy game.",1
"a straight upgrade to the now classic counter strike: source. this game gives you a wide selection of guns, weapon skins, and customizable loadouts. the graphics and ui are a ton better than cs:s, it really is an improvement. even those who havent already enjoyed cs or cs:s can jump into this game and love it. you can play by yourself or online against other players and have equally as much fun. definitely worth the low price of $14.99, i recommend it.",1
"got yelled at by a girl who was bottom fragger, 10/10.",2
"awesome game. my first cs game was ages ago on the first versions on schools computer lab, and the game has gone so far... i love that the game is all about the skills and there is no pay to win whatsoever. i play this game all the time.",3
"hard online skill based game, funny and tense; counter-strike is back with a nice community (russians), lovely!",1
"from a competitive standpoint its the best shooter on the market with a thriving community that will be around for many, many years. if you want a team-based game with tight and hard to master mechanics this is the game for you. if you want a fun fps to play deathmatch on for a few hours i would recommend the latest iteration of call of duty or battlefield.",5
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",1
"i am pretty new to pc fps, i use to play cod on xbox but after quitting xbox to play pc. i have gotten into this game alot more now. i enjoy the gameplay and how its alot more fair. there are no hacks i have come across and the only thing bad is how much some of the market items cost. seriously who the  spends 250 on a cosmetic item, who even has 250 in their steam wallet?",1

"one of the worlds best competitive fps!! growing day by day! worth to get!",1
"classic counter-strike for the modern age. taking the feel and style of 1.6 with the graphical and technical improvements of source, cs:go makes a strong case to be the best counter-strike. a well done matchmaking system makes it easy to find matches with stock rules. this is furthered by the ability to choose between casual rules for when you want to practice and ranked competetitve mode with the original rules. and, should you still want the modded community servers, its got that too. the esports community is alive and well with events like dreamhack and multiple other major tournaments with massive prize pools, drawing in the top teams from around the world. counter-strike:global offensive also introduces a weapon skin drop system for customization and seasonal passes to support mapmakers. all in all, this is the best of source and the best of 1.6 mashed together into one shiny, fluid, and amazing game. if you only are going to get one counter-strike, this is the one to get.",1
"if youre looking for a game full of hackers and complete s then look no further. cs:go is a grid 2 rip off, and no matter how you die, the killer has an aimbot. do you love making mlg callouts on call of duty: the big red one, but no one pays any attention to what you are telling them? well with cs:go, you can make these completely legit callouts such as theyre here, ohhhh rafters and everyones all time favorite and most commonly used theyre all yard. have a bunch of cs:go skins worth hundreds of dollars that you want to piss down the drain? then why not check out cs:go lounge, where pro teams go head to head, and have a percentage of winning. you can now bet on them, and constantly see items drift away. because the constant no-clippers in game werent rage inducing enough. and a final tip if you do decide to buy this train wreck of a game. use the most op weapon known to video games. the nova! thanks p.s. srsly buy dis game lmao",2
"this is one of the few shooters ive played and i find it very entertaining and exciting, with an abundance of maps and game mods to choose from. you can have a lot of fun if you can get over some mean people that you will come across. overall, i recommend it :)",3

"every time you put this game on sale more and more hackers/smurfs will be playing the game. stop. its ruining the game.",3
"cg:go is a blast to the past; a nod to the old-school days of the late 90s, and its more than welcome in my gaming livery. whilst i love cod and titanfall, theres something uniquely compelling about starting up a match of cs:go, with its deliberate and stayed pacing, and its risk vs reward gameplay mechanics, its no wonder this game has taken off for the 3rd time in its lifecycle. its popular right now for a reason, and that reason is good. a must-buy.",1

"hahahahahaha i know this dude who buys a  ton of cs:go crates...hes an idiot...that is all. maplestory",1
"counter strke global offensive is a great addition to the series, with new gameplay modes and a new variaty of weapons, as well as customization. the game is really hard, especially for new people. for others who have played the cs games, it should fell the same, but a little different. many of the guns from the old games have returned as well as dissapeared. (bring back the mp5 or have it replace the mp7). overall, counter strike global offensive recives (for me) a 8/10. score: 8/10 pros: -new guns -better graphics -new gameplay modes -customization cons: -recoil is hard to get use to",1
"best game , new source engine 2013 , new gun , new skin , and ..",1

"if you somehow havent gotten csgo on one of its many sales, i believe you should. i think everyone should atleast try this game due to simplistic easy to learn, hard to master fps curve. unline many other genres of competetive gaming, you can see yourself and others become better players by just playing the game casually (no disrespect to the other competetive genres). by playing csgo youre almost guranteed to get better by just having fun! you dont even have to play competetivley either, just grab a few friends and hop into a gun game or casual playlist and mess around.",1
"i thought this would be like call of duty. then i played it. its way  better.",1

"counter strike: global offensive -graphics are great. light and shadow are realistic. -weapon models are pretty cool! -nice game interface. -a lot more than i can say. recommend this game! ps. sorry about my grammar if its wrong.",1
"its a pretty fun game. you just have to learn how to play it first. you cant play it like cod or bf and just run n gun most of the time since you only have 1 life in most gamemodes. most fun youll every have in this game is playing competetive with some friends and even when you suck you have fun doing it. also micro transactions make the gaming world go round.",2
"counter-strike:global offense also known as cs:go (not counter-strike sus source) is a gg good game 8.9/10 in my opinion i like the tactical and thinking/teamwork aspect tht sets it apart from average shotters like cod :c but there is barely any aiming down the sights in this game guns are restricted to hip fire except for sniper rifles and the aug assault rifle class for both teams. the game is sterotypically a type of mlg thing so you have to get good of decent in some sort of way shape or form with this game, and it is rewarding. gg good game (   )",1
"learnt russian quicker than i ever could on rosetta stone. 10/10",3
"i love this game to a certain extent that i really cannot comprehend at the moment. it is a really good source if you want to practice team communication and assertiveness. i wish there werent as many hackers though, but i have encountered very little in the time that i have played. i would definetly buy and play the hell out of this game.",1
"this game is awesome. get it now or the terrorists will blow up your mum. 9/10",2
"this is, in my opinion, the best game i have ever played. for $15, you get more value than you could possibly imagine. besides being one of the most popular e-sports around, cs:go is absolutely a great casual game as well. i love every bit of this game.",3
"excelent game overall must buy if your tired of playing consoles",1
"shoot ak ak boolet go above head, all boolet get killed cause of enemy boolet leave csgo burn computer regret the fact you got 30 min ban buy new computer get csgo start game play game redo over",3
"this game...is by far my most favorite shooter i have ever played. the competitive scene is intense, the casual play is fun, and the community is filled with great people. i have dedicated 200+ hours into this game and i have loved (almost) every minute of it. definately a must have for any steam account",3
"i had to sell my parents for money to buy more skins, but overall its pretty good.",5
"better have a 5-man premade or you will get ed by smurfs, hackers, scrublords, or gaben himself. dont even try opening cases unless your opening 100$ worth at one time, gaben makes money that way. but the biggest thing of csgo is *drum roll* a smurf on your team!",2
"this is one of the best tactical fpss out there! it stays true to the previous counter strike titles, while giving it a breath of fresh air with renewed graphics, new guns, new maps, and a skill based rank/matchmaking system.",2
"good shooting game, if you can ignore the sudden deadly lags happens unexpectably during the game :d",1
"one of the best games and recommend this in sale and in normal price.",2

"its like the matrix the enemy can use slow motion to dodge all your bullets, but you cant matchmaking/10",2
"good game, kill people i like. game is 2 good 4 me, many hackers",1
"counter strike global offensive is a game like no other. it requires you to think smart, work together with your team, and for you to pay attention to your surrounding. this game is especially awesome with the skins you get for weapons, in which you can sell them in the market. other than the competitive cooldown, the assorted weapons, teamwork, and maps will make you want to play for a very, very long time. 9/10 stars and i would recommend this to a friend.",2
"you shoot people, sometimes they die, sometimes you die. 10/10 also: best country hate simulator.",3
"very good game would recommend to anyone intrested in fps, great replay value",3
"this is one of the best fps ever , it isnt like call of duty or battlefield or halo or anyother fps ; it redefines the franchise that is probably the god of fps . it not only features the fast-paced and skill-based casual game mode but it introduces new modes like arms race , demolitions and team deathmatch ( which is quite popular in most fps games ) . i certainly recommend this to any fps fan out there ( unless you hate the classics ) . the balance in all guns is amazing , most fps games like cod and battlefield dont have a balance in the guns and so a guy who is a level or two above you has an advantage over you as he has the better gun . in cs go you dont need level or stuff , just a bit of skill and you are good to join the combat .",1
"game systems and the graphics are great but a little bit silly bots. overall, i love this game. :)",3
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",1
"after playing this game iv acquired some weapon skill that will help me to survive when russia invades our country. be afraid putin, because im ready for you and your army !",4
"at first play, compared to cs: source, i didnt like it. after about an hour of playing competitive i had fallen in love with counter-strike all over again. receiving items in game, skins for guns etc was brilliant. if you liked counter-strike, purchase this game now. now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! add me, add me so we can play.",3

"this is one of the games i play the most and il tell you why its an amazing game it requires you alot of practice if you want to become good but its a fun game unless if your in a game with russians/hackers but that dosent always happen you can have a good time with your friends i do not recommend you to uncreate weapon skins it will lose you alot of money but do it for fun if you think your lucky i wasnt but i recommend you buy the skins of the market, my favorite part of this game is shooting pepole its really enjoyable probobly for alot of pepole to make somebody mad by killing them alot i do like the competitive scene of this game mostly. there are other gamemodes but i dont play them i play deathmatch only to warmup before my competitive i do play faceit witch removes hackers thats probobly the most fun i can have in this game.",3
"awesome game, its got a good community and great gameplay definatly worth the buy for anyone who loves a challenging fps with a great emphasis on teamwork.",3
"ahem, allow me to begin this review with a bang. *bang* that is one thing you will hear a lot in counter-strike, mainly because youre blowing your own brains out in real life because of randomers on matchmaking calling you a noob team and saying wtf noob. but ive talked about one of the bad things, lets talk about a good thing, the guns go badaboom, pow pow, bim bam ding. overall, id say this game was 5/5 codpiece laces and id highly recommend calling your team mates codpieces for comedic effect.",2

"please dont buy this game if you want a happy life free of suicidal thoughts.",2
"this game is very good. and you will enjoy every second you play if you dont discover the csgo market. buy and selling knives cuns and anything with a big price tag will get you spending all your money on it.",2
"played cs for years already and still not tired of the gameplay, best allday game !",1
"cs:go, love the fact i spent $1,000 of my life time dollars on this game. i hate you gaben. we had a deal, i wouldnt spend over $100 in this game. but, your skins/community is soo good my wallet begged to be broke. gg gaben. seriously, this is an amazing game better than cod atleast xd",2

"this is a great multiplayer first-person shooter game, similar to most f2p fps games, but quite a bit better. my only problem with the game is that although i am not quite an fps beginner, i am having trouble keeping up with the skilled players on multiplayer servers.",1
"just perfect game. i really like it. ive played cs 1.6 for years and this game is great sequel in cs franchise. i would definetly recommend this game.",1

"i have many feeling for this game, i love it but yet hate it. i will start off with the hates, one of the main things about this game are the prices of in-game items. such as keys for example. i personally think that these keys are way too much. really? $2.50 a piece? that crazy, now the cases, those are different story. cases are pretty decently even with price wise. 10 cents to around 50 cents at the max. but keys, its like paying for a gallon of a gas a key. now for the good side of what i think of this game. i love this first person shooter/ competive/team work game. its action packed, gets your heart pumping, and is alot of fun. but one thing i do wish valve does in the future is that they decrease the price of their items. its insane, my rating: 9/10",4
"great game. was easy to get back into after taking a long break after 1.5, and unlike a lot of games now generally a decent community too.",3
"this game is true to its original. truly skill based. highly strategical.",2
"better than cs:s, feels like 1.6. wish there were custom maps though. edit: i realized that there are custom maps and mods, awesome.",1
"maybe the best counter strike after 1.6! weapon skins, good matchmaking system and nice gameplay. this game is awesome!",1
"i have played over 2000 hours in cs:source and i rarely saw cheaters there. i encounter a cheater every day when i play cs:go, everyday! you know how ridiculous that is? oh yes, you can report players for cheating but i rarely see justice. how about fixing the cause instead of the results. people cant help cheating, because most of them suck at this game! i hate them, but i blame valve for not taking proper action. the game is too easy to hack, do something about it! this game is not worth a review if its so easy to cheat. very poor performance from valve.",1
"open 1000 cases, receive 1000 bizon skins... best game ever.",3
"yea, it is pretty good. but if it suddenly stops working and there are bugs, valve doesnt give a . praise be gabe newll.",1

"fun, competitive but can be difficult to learn without help",5
"awesome way to earn some money and awesome shooter game",4
"cs:go is the latest entry into the counter strike franchise, and a worthy one at that. guns feel and sound powerful, classic maps mixed in with the new spice things up a little, and its oh-so rewarding when you finally master that gun youve been trying so hard to get more equipped with. pick it up if youre looking for a challenging-but-rewarding multiplayer shooter.",4

"since i started to play counter strike global offensive a new world opened for me! with all the tactics i learned from this game life has become easier for me. whenever ill go running im sure to take a knife with me so i can run even faster then i usually do! i made a fake bomb and painted an a on the floor in the living room. whenever i come out of the shower i wrap my towel around my head and pretend to be a terrorist. i pick up the bomb i made and run around in my house. when i reach the living room i plant it on the a side and make some beeping sounds. sometimes my dog gets close to me when i plant and he starts to lick my rectal opening. i think this is just one of the side effects of playing this game. my family thinks im crazy and my girlfriend left me because of it. this game has become life for me and i dont know what i should do without it. thank you gaben, i accept you as my lord and saviour. gaben is love, gaben is life.",4
"its really fun u just buy a triggerbot and win cal main",1
"valve really delivered with this latest counter-strike game! its got a wonderful built in queueing for competive matches that places you with similar skilled players, a giant playerbase including mappers and community built servers with custom playermade content, and custom gun models that just drop from playing the game so you can show off all your cool looking skins to the other ~9 players trying to murder you. you can also sell ingame drops for more steam games or other skins! the quick competive queue option has made my love of counter-strike renewed and the constant updates are always fixing the issues that do arise and balance the game rather nicely. 10/10, if you like a simple, easy, reaction based shooter then youll love this game!",2

"game is somewhat of a mixture of a wet noodle and brown sauce - bland. in theory this game could work as a cooking simulator for single mothers with a lot of time on their hands however i do not think that this could be possible as this game requires a lot of decent leg movement. overall this is the best game of the year 2/10 - ign",1
"hands down better than cs:source, and on its way to be better than 1.6.",3

"really good game! cs:go is really addicting , atleast for me. i love the skins you get and if you dont like them .. just sell them! :d this game is a really skill-needed game and not like call of duty that everyone can be a pro. its fun playing ! the ranks and comp matches... i recommend you buy it so you can feel how it is to play and not look at the pictures and say its crappy!",1

"go into counterstrike matchmaking game immediately get made fun of for being trans top frag and carry bad teammates laugh as they are still hating on me and i am the only reason we are winning start killing in console team kicks me team loses game that they were up 13-3 i would say cs is the greatest game ever but that is an understatement just remember one thing your first good game means nothing what means something is when you can do consistently well and also remember time in cs means a lot whether its for practicing aim or just gaining game sense the more time you have in cs the better off you are if you start off not being able to get a kill deathmatch and improve aim and then just play matchmaking much more than a normal human being and bam you are going to be golden ^_^",4
"cant go wrong with one of the best and most competitive fps game out there!",5

"cod tetris mode! its like cod but without all the fun. some people might want to lure you in by saying cods fer fukkin kids bra, thissis so realtik, but standing still and shooting (not aiming god forbid) a pixel is surprisingly not as fun as it may sound. this is so realistic that a grenade doesnt kill you and a flashbang makes the screen go white, which is racist. if youre to poor to buy cod and you dont want to resort to prostitution, i recommend buying this 1999 mod, even though 4,99$ is a bit much for pixel hunt deluxe",1
"this game is so addicting it is not even funny. 10/10 would buy again. recomended.",1
"everytime i play this game, my guy gets ing mulched. people sit in the portopotties more than an eldery man pooping his guts out. people trade rainbow guns like its the ing black market. 10/10",2

"when gotham is ashes, who will you run to when the dragons burn down your village, when the enclave take away your democracy. there is only one thing that can stop them, an awp. but what can stop an awp? simple, a c4 bomb in the middle of the desert that blowes up a couple boxes. but what stops a c4 bomb? pff, obviously a hostage hidden in some motel, why else would the hide him there. but frontier, why? simple, yas, it is a door simulating motel of horrors that only the strongest willed may escape with the hostage back to the diner and everyone can have lunch at afterwards. so, when gotham is ashes, then you have my permission to die.",2

"first the good review: - its cs 10/10 - the weapons sistem is nothing like the others cs, you can gain the skin weapons by playing or opening boxes or buying them on the market, and thats very cool. now the bad review, and this one makes me so angry: - the competitive: 1 - the team, if can find those noob teams that kill their own partners or just be afk the whole game! 2 - the competitve cooldown, now this one its just annoying and overwhelming stupid, because you get kicked by leaving the game and thats fine but imagine that your net goes down or our pc was turn off because of some lightning, you will get that same kick and you cant to nothing about it and thats makes me so angry because you get 7 days of penalty because you net was down and thats not fair. hope that this will help someone!",2

"dont buy this game if you plan on seeing the sun again.",2
"get it when its cheap in a sale or something, its a great game but youre ed without practise. competitive can be intense but at the same time frustrating. i personally prefer tf2 good game not excellent but worth a few quid 8 out of 10",2
"great game in general, but rank system is complete . its all about wins, not kill and death ratio or skill. even the worst player can be high rank, all he needs is to play with someone good. he can have extreme negative kd but still rank up because his team won. because of this there is always a huge gap between players on each team, kind of obious when top player got 20-9 and bottom player got 6-24. and all this in a game where the team and team play is this important, also it makes it fatal to be put in a team with low skill players.",3
"best game if u a pro xd but beware of scammer,phisters and sharkers if you are trading in csgo",5
"this is my first counter strike game ive played from the franchise and honestly i dont remember having this much fun with a competitive game since this game. on the down side though the ranking system is very confusing and that the keys and skins are mostly always just on the marketplace and people have a unfair chance to get the thing they want in a case, i know its a gamble but really valve ? 25 crates to get a purple or a red is way to much. otherwise this is a great game with many different possibilitys in each match you join. i deffenitly recommend this game to anyone that wants a competitive game thats not the typical call of duty cookie cutter fps",2
"this game is true to its original. truly skill based. highly strategical.",2
"counter strike: global offensive is basically a very big update to counter strike: source. featuring much better graphics, gameplay, maps, etc. i really enjoy playing this game whether i win or lose matches. cs:go, in my opinion, is a much better alternative to call of duty. but, i was definitely not expecting valve to give cs:go the tf2 treatment, with the skins and items. today, you have knives going for about $200+, and thats just an outragous price for a virtual item. to see people are actually buying items and making money off of this game (and losing more) is just, wow. im personally not a fan of this, but i guess, it seemed to of worked out for valve in the long run. every time i see someone with an extremely expensive knife/skin, it kills me a little on the inside. cs:go is still a very fun game nonetheless, and would suggest it to anyone fond of strategic fps games. just, try not to spend too much money on these kind of games. sometimes, you dont even realize how much money youre spending on it.",1
"its extremely fun once you get used to the game and start to climb the massive learning curb. beware that mm servers are extremely bad and will often result in you wanting to quit. would buy again. 12/10",2

"pretty one of the greateful and most popular valves games ever. cs:go its a new wave of oldschool cs 1.6, and it brings many nice mechanics, graphics and usability improvements. i recommend this game for all players, who play 1.6 may years ago and who would like to discover something new :)",2
"great game, it will pay for itself by selling drops from games.",1

"this game introduced me to cs. challenging but fun. 10/10",1
"not quite the same as cs:s, but still a fun, competitive, and frustrating game.",3
"now, that i have given this game a lot of time. i can safely say that this game will be here for quite awhile. it is gaining a lot of coverage by esports and the like. it brings in a more modern piece of work for the fps genre. though there is still several problems with this game, i can see it being ported into source 2 and becoming an incredible game. right now there are multiple things that i would like to see being tweaked like 128 tick servers, hit registry, etc. i can only hope it is taking this long only because they are working at the source 2 engine and getting ready to port multiple games over. it has the potential to be the biggest thing in fps history!",2
"play this game to sell items and to get other games. long term investments with operations. 10/10 would economics again.",2
"i like the game just not my team mates also make russian only servers",2
"i kill more chickens than i do people... otherwise, its the best first person shooter ive ever played. its entirely skill-based and doesnt rely on players leveling up weapons and unlocking new things, but it focuses on a player as an individual getting better at the game. thats pretty special in todays market.",1
"this is the evolution of counter-strike. very fast-paced, and contains a big selection of old and new guns. new gun skins and new features ensure fair gameplay style and customizing your own style. cs:go is a very great game to get and i would reccommend this to anyone who love to play fps games a lot.",1
"great game never gets boring always endless things to do highly recommend",4
"theres always that one guy who keeps using these advantages i dont what i should call them, perhaps magic. mostly because magic is heresy and noone like a heretic. ~ may your framerates be cinematic and your temperatures be high praise gaben",1
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",1
"it is a nice game, my favourite i guess. the frame rate is good! but you need to have skills. if you dont have skills with shooting people. maybe this is not the game for you.",2
"counter strike s my first fps game and ts new of the game i liked t",1
"great shooter. counterstrike was always awesome. cs:go is like cs 1.6 with major graphical adjustments.",3
"this game is soo addictive!! and russian rage is so lol :)",1
"cs:go is a free,fast and fun way to learn russian!",1
"more realistic gameplay than other fps game, better graphic and gameplay than previous one...",1
"all my friends really enjoy this game and they are all good at the game, i used to join them and we would all play casual but they all got better and started to play competitive mode but i wouldnt join them because i used to only get 1 kill and 9 deaths (because im so pro.) now thats all they play, i now spend all time playing single player games because eveyone is on cs:go 10/10 would lose friends again",1
"if your not global elite dont talk to anybody, unless its your mom to buy you a karambit.",2
"cs:go is a great multiplayer online shooter. even though you cant ads that doesnt matter, also its a valve game that should be expected. ive put a lot of time into this game and i dont plan on stopping any time soon. the community only seems to grow and playing competitive is a lot of fun since you dont really ever get teammates that troll (from my experience so far). overall its the best online shooter i have ever played since cs:s.",1
"my choise of shooter - cs:go. i think, this game is a worthy continuation of the old, beloved cs 1.6. here everything is clearly traced, there appeared a large variety of weapons. it has become more than just cs.",3
"this is my favorite game of all time, from pwning new players with an auto sniper or p90, or playing the game seriously with a m4 or ak, i always have fun no matter what i do on here. love the community aswell, if you are a casual fps player i highly recommend this game.",1
"i play coutser dtrike to fight wit hmy enemies crush soles and make a person cry",1
"if youve followed the cs train from 1.6, you wont be disappointed by this title. 5 stars!",1
"this game is really rewarding based on its skill oriented gameplay, and is recommended for players seeking a challenging game to get into, or seasoned players who have not yet upgraded from previous games. i dont know what im saying okay just buy it",1
"counter-strike global offensive is an amazing game. coming from team fortress 2 and mobas such as league of legends and dota 2, i did not expect much from this game, much less for it to be the tight, well-paced, tactical shooter it is. i was wrong though. cs:go has its own perspective on the fps genre and it perfects that spin to a tee. matches not only consist of individual skill to make the shot but also team coordination as a whole to defend or blow up the map. granted, this game is quite challenging at first, but get past the learning curve and a tight, extremely satisfying tactical shooter awaits you.",1
"spent over 100$ on cases still no knife i will get one one day spent almost 400 hours on competitve 10 out of 10",2
"this is one hell of a game that everyone should play. the best about this game is not the gameplay, mechanics or the graphics, no way, the best is his comunity. in my whole life ive never seen a comunity who suported as much and with so much enthusiam gay people, eveybody seems to be openly gay and have no problem being adressed as it and even more family friendly! everybody seems to know each other and their mothers and its just great to see people being suportive to each other. if youre searching something to play with other high achivers like yourself who smoke so much grass they dont even know the day they live on, this is your game. p.d. if you believe hackers exist in this game you probably suck at it.",1
"simply great game, i love the mechanics of this particular shooter, i played a lots of shooters and i would say this was the best shooting game in my expiriance, recoment this game to anyone who loves shooters, this is the best choise for you. like counter-strike 1.6 was the best shooter (and it still is). this game also is good for playing with friends, clan wars, deathmatch, gungame mixes and other fun modes.",1
"still a great game that i play every once in a while. community is nice and the game can pretty much run on any system at the moment so if you are looking for an fps this is a great choice.",2
"very good game, enjoy playing and really recomending the game for those who havent played it!",5
"i can confirm that this game is amazing. as long as you have a good team, 128 tick server and no anger issues :) also, silvers have all the good weapons & cant use them while on the other hand higher ranks dont have  for skins & can 360 qs with a awp crossmap hs.",4
"ruined my life, free time, had personal problems 10/10 would play again",5
"counter-strike is a classic... emphasis on classic. if you remember the stiff/quick animation of the previous game then youll see that it hasnt changed much. the graphics look better and the players look better but from a first person view youll see the resemblence of the previous games, so if you liked the old one(s) youll like this one :)",1
"i only really play competitive machmaking now, the rush of being the last man on your team and trying to find the bomb to defuse is something you cant experience in any other game 10/10 would reccomend.",1
"amazing game, love the match making. could use a way to tell how close you are to ranking up or being deranked, but overall good game.",2
"if there were ever to be a world war 3, i sincerely hope the russians gets nuked, all because of this game. 10/10",2
"good alternative to cs:s and cs 1.6. i used to play cs 1.3 i wish i could play that game again. cs:go is worth buying.",1
"with the updates cs:go has become the successor to orginal counter-strike that it needs.",2
"if you are looking to get addicted to betting, and trading you cant go wrong here. very fun",1
"i wouldnt get addicted they said, i would have a life they said. 10/10 would do again.",2
"you can rekk cod-kids while they call you hacker 10/10",3
"if you have a lag stutter for ten seconds, the game dcs you and you get 0 dollars for a round or two, since ten seconds of lag can disable steam for three minutes. the bot ai will buy a glass cannon awp and then run into the enemy no matter how many or even if one person says to hold position. you cant surrender until your leaver gets the 5 minute pass and sometimes your autistic allies will try to make the game continue so that you lose rounds and derank more. it takes around 15 seconds after death to actuall be able to take control of the bot, and to top it all off the game has one of the most infamously bad hit registrations of any modern competetive fps.",1
"great game, but theres a bit of lag (i live in alabama, thats why). alot of weapons have there reasonable damage and recoil, the designs look awsome! (i may say this is a great game other than the lag, why here in alabama) so on a scale to 1/10, it will be... 9.5/10",1
"i didnt know that terrorists can speak english very well...",1
"good mmofps based game with a good competitive scene :d",2
"i am going to be totally honest, i only got this game because i thought it was the correect one for garrys mod... but it wasnt. even though i accidently got this game i highly recommend this for anyone that is into counter strike or fps (first person shooter) games.",1
"i played my first match of casual cs:go and straight away realised this is alot like garrys mod, so i tried to noclip and was shot... i then play my first competitive match and wondered why everyone had gold stars and aks so i went into paint and drew one to use as my profile picture. then finally i was walking around office slighty more experienced at the game in genral, learning grenade tactics and peaking ect, i then came to realise that i had killed quite alot of people that round and began to be called a hacker/smurf which obviously wasnt true considering i have 1 account and at the time about 5 hours game time, so thats somthing to keep in mind, note to self: (eveyone, when they rage call others hackers). and finally chickens, i knifed one, got hungry, went downstairs, made chicken sandwhich, came back upstairs, 30 minute ban. 10/10 would knife again.",2
"amazing game! barely any lag and amazing graphics! defenatly recommended :)",1
"this game is extremely fun, especially with friends. i like the competitive side of this game, there is a lot of information to learn and if you really want to be great at this game, it becomes addicting.",2
"amazing first person shooter and easy to run for people who want to get into pc gaming!",1
"great game, adds a more strategic viewpoint as compared to counter-strike: source. the graphics are excellent, the gameplay is awesome, and the skins are great. the only downside to this game is that it maintained its  community from counter-strike: source when it comes to alternate game servers. if you dont have this game, buy it. its worth the money.",1
"its different and i was really against it at first but somehow they converted me... in other words: love it! love it! love it! love it! get it! get it! get it! get it!",1
"steam is the gift that keeps on giving, and cs:go is just another jewel in volvos crown.",2
"the pinnacle of tactical first person shooters. nothing can recreate the feeling of a an actual team in videogames except for cs:go, and very hard not to recommend to everyone. even if the competitive mode doesnt interest, there are still very interesting modes to play other than it, and a lot of maps and mods to apply to it.",1
"-gets for full price- ... -game goes on a discount killing spree-",1
"its a fun game if you have five people to play with getting randoms just kinda sucks alot of the time.",5
">see a guy >shoot him >miss every shot >he turns around >kills me in one shot >exit cs:go 10/10",1
"pretty impressed at the fact that valve improved the graphics quite a lot and added a few more game modes like arms race etc. which does make it a bit cod-ish but still the simplicity of the counter-strike series was maintained. although many new maps were added, we still notice the classic maps like dust, dust2, aztec etc. its not a very fast paced fps like cod or bf yet its very enjoyable to play.",1
"a fun, addictive, and sharp game that puts you in mind straining, tense situations putting you friend against friend, brother against brother, and you against an angry 4th grader crying for the lack of respawn. if youre willing to put yourself against the unknown trigger finger in these deathmatch, bomb scenerio, and hostage situation game modes then this game is for you.",1
"since 1.6, the best competitive fps series ever. 10/10 would respawn again.",1
"this  is the worst ing game ever, it is so bad you just want to  in your own mouth. 10  / 4 bannanas",3
"cs has evolved so much over the years and to me cs:go is hands down the best one in the series a lot of you may disagree but to me the game is a mixture of 1.6 and source its also extremely fun to play , the game works kind of like tf2 when it comes to items you get different skins for guns and knifes theres tons of modes to play plus all the mods you can watch live matches and theres just a lot of content for a great price if your looking for a fun fps to play i recommend cs:go is your looking for a game to get really competitive in i suggest this, overall its an amazing game that any fan of the genre well fall in love with 8.5/10",1
"this game is will consume you. be free while you still can. run",1
"hurt myself so that people would give me money for keys. please help me",1

"awpd a nova 2 in a comp when im a silver. 10/10 for rage. definately worth buying",3
"hard and addicting, one of my favorites though. dont buy it if you dont have skill or dont want to work to get better.",2
"great game although the recoil is a mix between cs 1.6 and css",2

"more like counter-strike: watch me carry all these newbs.",1
"is a very good game very adictive there is a hudge community and lots of people are friendly all the best part is the hackers and people like that are all delt with by u u need a good computer to play and just enjoy this game",3
"epic game. really fun and a must have for only 15$ not on sale.",3
"this game is a fun thrilling fps game that has all diferrent guns and game modes i would rate this game a 8/10 this game would be a good buy",1
"just like the old days. counter-strike: global offensive introduces the classic tactical team-based gameplay presented in its predecessors, counter-strike and counter-strike: source. with stunning visuals, new weapons, exciting gamemodes, and steam workshop support, counter-strike: global offensive needs not a sequel thanks to the constant updates from valve to enhance replay value and add new content that goes on and on. a must-buy for fans of multiplayer first person shooter games.",1
"easily the best multiplayer shooter that ive ever played. its a ridiculously addictive timesink thats fun to play alone or with friends. hell, it even pays for itself with all the drops!",1
"great game overall. most parts are unrealistic, but the different camos of guns are great. the game modes are great, and it takes a long time to get good.",2
"if you are bored and looking for some quick action this is the game for you, do not hesitate in buying it. cons : 1)very hard for those who are new to pc gaming 2)weapons are very hard to get used to even for old pc gamer 3)source engine shows its getting old tech pros : 1)very fun gameplay specially when with friends  2)nice graphics style even though its no fancy tech 3)very simple 4)pure fps experience",2
"much better than css, and actually makes me want to get back into counter strike. lots of different modes which are enjoyable and a decent game to play considering the price. my rating : 81",1

"if you are someone who has in the past enjoyed playing last man standing games or game types this is your game. there is nothing as thrilling as being the last man while all your teammates silently watch you destroy the other remaining 3 enemys and win. as if the game wasnt good enough valve added rewards such as weapons and stickers. weapons and stickers can be traded or sold on the market giving you money for other things. i definitily recommed this game for people who have in the past enjoyed lms or search and destroy in cod.",1
"just when i thought that the legacy of counter strike is about to fade away and bite the dust , like a bolt from the blue comes csgo the saviour of the franchise . keep us addicted and glued forever .way to go !!! loved the transition. thanks .",2

"great teamwork great gameplay and great weapon skins. what more could you possibly want?",2
"csgo is for the people who is bored of the tiresome everyday fps it brings a learning curve for those people who want to take it step further then battlefield and cod because this game takes some serious dedication to get really good at and even though i have played more than a day im not even that good;im only in silver competitive so if i was you definitely buy this over the next cod or battlefield if you actually want a challenge.",1
"the game you waste more money on weapons than the game itself. 400$/10",3
"nice game as a community and fun but bad movement. dont need skills like cs1.6 but still the graphics is bettet than cs1.6",1

"great action game with strategic teamwork! plot destruction with your fellow terrorists or keep the terrorist scum from destroying by diffusing the bomb or preventing a plant. rescue hostages or prevent the rescue. hours of addictive fun!! would recommend this game to anyone that likes first person shooters and enjoys teamwork!",1
"hands down. cod is small poop pile compared to this.",1
"i didnt know how many people ed my mum until i encountered matchmaking",2
"a quite difficult game to start in, but once you are introduced to the skins and selling youll be hooked.",1
"elite counter-terrorists and highly trained terrorists still dont know how to aim down the sights. 10/10",1
"its a seriously addictive and fun game to play, still a few glitches here and there, as in all games, but the biggest one is the bans, seriously over zealous, so beware, like with the bullet that hits you from around a corner, youll never know you got it till it hits you. then theres nothing you can do.",3
"full of action full of fun and full of friends! every match i find action and its always fun! i really like this game because i can always get joy into this game. its full of people, i can find a match under 20 seconds. and there is a lot of maps if you buy passes, what are passes? passes give you skins from drops and cases which are worth a lot of money but they go down in a while, but you have to buy the passes for $2.50 cents. which you can earn you money back in a day or two. so now you know how fun this game really is, buy it any price!",1
"this game is the best co-op/team based shooter since 99 (since its half-life 1 days), rehashed into pure meaty-delicious graphics that even a vegetarian could appreciate and ask for seconds. this game has consumed so much time out of my life, its stopped me achieveing anything at school, destroyed a marriage, lost me mutiple jobs and made me the man i am today. in which case i highly recommend if you wish to waste years of your life and become as awesome as 90% of the player base. dont expect it to be anything like 1.6, you cant spray and pray anymore, instead you have to stand still and burst fire like a normal human being and not run around the corner like rambo on crack cocaine. much love, azzy.",1
"simply awesome with the touch of skins and stattrak.",2

"1st round : started -> yey i got a new game wowoowow !!!! finished -> almost broke my mouse !!!! 10 / 10 would do that again.",1
"having played some of the previous counter strike games i am glad to say that this one lives up to the reputation of a great shooter. with implimenting steam market items in the game it is still not a common pay to win game as the paid items in game are purly visual and not neccasery. the game is very fun to play with friends and exercising great use of good communication and teamworking skills!",1
"great game, shame the matchmaking is such a pain in the  sometimes.",1
"10/10 overall skill level is the main part it isnt cod where you spray and its completly acurate and precise. weapon skins for making money for games and also for what design you want to have on your gun from a variety of skins that keep coming in from the steam workshop. custom maps on workshop that you can download. one of the best things about the game its a esport thats very popular.",1
"cs:go is a great game for all players to play, why not support the competitive fps scene by playing this game and watching streams throughout big tournaments.",4

"one of the best games i have ever played. there are some anoyying bits here and there, like how you get cooldowns after every 2 games you win if you are unranked or if your computer shuts down and you dont get back in the 3 very very very short minutes then you get a cooldown and if that happens over and over again you can get a 7 day ban. well other than that it is a fantastic game. i have been playing it for 3 weeks and have had so much fun. competetive is the best its not like your playing call of duty and you can just play for fun. most of the time its serious because you are trying to not derank and you are trying to rankup. overall 5/5",2
"trs are red, cts are blue, i suck at this game, you will too. haha just kidding :) if you used to play cs 1.6 when younger, you will love this new one, come on and try. 10/10",1
"the amount of money ive spent on this game..... its amazing!!!!",3
"counter strike global offensive is the fourth game in the main counter-strike franchise. it is a online tactical and first-person shooter developed by valve corporation and hidden path entertainment. if you buy this game and spend time on it it will be the best experience you will ever have in a first person tactical shooter. the community is ify, but once you get in a good lobby with freinds/strangers in the competitive game mode its a load of fun.it takes a little while to get used to but once you get the hang of the shooting and aiming in this game you will fall in love with it. the graphics are good and all in all the game is well pollished. if you have a chance to buy the game do it.",1
"am really enjoying cs:go, just getting into the cs series recently. 10/10",1
"this game suck because when you hit a teammate you get a 7 day ban",2
"this game is amazing! comparing this to older css , it is a great improvement. just awesome.",1
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",1
"love it, tons of action and killing. must play if you love strategic shooting games",2
"this game is fun becuase i like shooting bullets... 10/train",5
"pretty dam good game, you have to own this game if you love fps. * dont buy this game its a waste of money you can get banned for just about anything.",2
"it is a ok game. could be better. needs to be more like 1.6 that was the best multiplayer game of all time nothing comes close to it.",1
"am a scrub and i lag but i still have fun when i dont rage but if that doesnt entice you  you then",1
"do you really need to say anything about this game.....buy it godammnit:) *ahem**ahem* steam sales",2

"cheaters, smurfs, smurfs with cheats, cheaters with smurf acc. love it!",4
"i love this game rly much!!! and this is why! :) 1. its cheap. 2. i like the feature of having skins. 3. i like the recoil in this game compared to other fps games, its more realistic. 4. i love to make custom crosshairs by the console! 5. i like the feature of making ur own skins. 6. the rankng system in online-competitive is nice. 7. many different weapons. things that has to be improved 1. graphics ( i know its source engine! )",5
"when a player loses connection to their internet and timesout, the maximum amount of ban time they should get is 24 hours. getting a week ban because of connection issues is not fair.",2
"a serously war game between terrorists and counter-terrorists. an awesome game and funny 2 play, but you should know that there are alot of pro in cs:go so you need to be good :)",2
"great game 10/10 everyone has to love the counter-strike series >better than c.o.d >everyone loves to call you a hacker >hardly no 12vies :d",1
"what am i supposed to say here? its just counter-strike. everyone knows it. go and buy it.",1
"9/10 would play against hackers again. comp is a joke. just deranked from eagle to dmg 3rd time by playing with russians which dont want to communicate and in the enemy team theres atleast 3 hackers because the game is 1 every 2 month. yes, maybe even 10/10 as soon as its on sale again.",5
"*plays deathmatch* wow er stop using this gun. play the game right ok kills him again wow er you have no skill. use the knife. stop using the auto sniper. you cant ing play this game you ing er  sucker. i bet you suck  in real life er.",1
"if youre used to cs:s it may take you a minute to get your head around all the new features in this game, but after that its a pretty solid and good game. the cosmetic weapons drops are a nice touch to individualize your weapons, and if youre not into that kind of thing there is alot of money to be made selling off your drops. the gun game if fast and fun like it should be and the casuale game is pretty good as well, but youll be playing alot against russians so dont expect much chat, unless you go to the player sponsored servers which is also an option. as for the competitive game, its either one of the most infuriating or rewarding experiences in the game, so its a bit hit and miss, and youll more than likely spend most of your time on dust ii because it doesnt seem like anyone plays anything else. all in all, its a good game with alot of new features, and if you liked the other css then its a deffinent buy, but like all other css its best with friends!",1
"i got a lucky case drop and my friends wont talk to me. 10/10",1
"c y k a simulator, thank you ing russians. cause of you i hate this game.",2

"this game.  this game.  this game. the competitive server are absolute . near everyone who plays it are 14 year old xx420blazeitxx kids who mic spam memes, racial slurs, and obscenities. the private server era of cs & cs:s is kill. its just not fun anymore.",1
"yeah.... ive been trying to get this game from some time. when i got it i realised that there were skins released in this and discovered that there are knifes and the most expensive knife can go to 500$ so i finally thought to sell my kidney and get a cool knife so that i can show off and the time is not far when my 2nd kidney will also be missing. thats why i give it 5/5 . this game is 2 gud for a kidney , its worth to sell one for knife and skins.it is so interesting that all kind of people will add you up to trade and they are quite interesting",3
"i swear im not bad at this game, its just everyone else is is a hacker...",1
"excelent game and recommended to others. great job on making the game.",4
"a pretty good game if you are low on cash, and really want to experience the real ways of russian life thanks to european matchmaking, i will never have to leave my door again to experience slavic cultures 8/10 - blyat",1
"first shooter i ever had to learn how to play. 8/10 the russians expect everyone in the team to speak russian",1
"csgo is probably one of my favorite games. it has a strong competitive sense about it that keeps you drawn in. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys playing games competitively.",4
"only possibility at the moment if ur looking for competitive fps! awesome!",4
">see a guy >shoot him >miss every shot >he turns around >kills me in one shot >exit cs:go 10/10",1
"great game to play with friends or yourself worth the money. i have never played any of the other cs but this one is a must have if you like fps 10/10 i would say!",2
"this game is an amazing fps, and is worth the 15 dollars.",3
"this game is an intense shooter with pretty nice graphics. it is very hardcore, and i suggest that you buy only if you want the thrill of the kill.",1
"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",4
"fantastic game, lots of fun, the skin section drains your money but hey :d - 1.6 was better, but this adds a lot of new features.",2
"very good, takes a lot of skill, practice, and teamwork. my kind of game!",1
"i played a counter-strike game in my life first time this week. even thought i dont play fps games on pc it is not hard to play.",4
"this game is epic, but the rank system takes a while to realise that you are pro.",2
"personaly, one of the best developed games created by valve.as you play deathmatch,casual,demolition,competetive,arms race, you earn ranks and learn how to become a cs go pro.but thats not all you can brose and take a look in the community based servers, which are sometimes recommended.(vac problems)(kinda). finnally you can buy 5 versions of counter strike for 29.99 wich is a huge amound of savings, because you get more for less. in conclusion this game supports many graphicvs cards. i mean i bought call of duty ghost and i cant even play it maybe tell the end of the month because it only supports graphic card with direct x 11. (ed till i get the money, well see if i like it more than cs go).",3
"cs go is life cs go is love dont buy this game otherwise your life will be over.",4
"insanely fun fps. recommended. crates will make you addicted.",2
"i made lots of money of this game.. helped me feed my doggies. 10/10",2
"i love this game. i spend most of my summer days playing this game. i sometimes forget to do stuff because of this game. for example, using the bathroom and eating my food. i had a bucket in my room for a duration of 7 weeks and it was changed not once during that time. but this game is really fun.",1
"this game is good. i recommend this game. meridian is an anchor please buy this game.",3
"very good game for cheating. anyway its a garbage. :)",2
"great game. try surfing with an xbox controller :p",2
"best game for improving all-round gaming skill on the market.",3
"at first, i was like: counter-strike is some old dead franchise destroyed by other fps like battlefield and planetside. at second thought, this game has his own style of gameplay, aiming system, recoil and feeling of acheivement as you progress in ranks. my first game was a mix between randomness and disapointment. after a few days and games, that have been a total catastrophic disaster, i gave up on this game. then, some friends of mine started teaching me the maps, the aiming and recoil system, and the only thing that you need to know in this game: aim for the ing head. great game, lost plenty of hours that i couldve used to study and get good grades in school, but who needs grades when you have counter-strike. 10/10 would fail my semester again.",3
"i learned fluent russian in 2 weeks thanks to this game.",2
"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",4
"whenever i get one shotted in the head by a camper with an ak-47, i break down and cry. when i accidentally fall in the water on certain maps, i feel like smashing my lava lamp. whenever i get a kill i feel like i deserve a pat on the back by every team mate that is 60 kills ahead of me. basically the community makes me feel like the worst player in the world. love it, 10/10.",2
"dis game is really fun if u would liek to get yelled at by frostgod cause he get r3kt by low elo noobs and throws it mik acros the rum and yells for more pepsi",1
"i dont know if i should hate this or make more people hate this. its really not superior in any aspect except for its decent graphics and competitive mode. im still recommending this though since i have accidentally wasted a lot of time on it.",2
"fun game. in game buying system is nice, so its all about how you do that match as opposed to a leveling system",1
"make sure you dont need to ever eat dinner while playing competetive, my first cooldown for leaving was 24 hours :3",1
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",1
"this game is basically life, counter-strike is one of the best games i have every played.",2
"best game inthaworld to learn: russian, french, italian, sweden, finish, spain and other east european words of familyinsulting, deathwishes and many more. if you add 5 players to your friendlist, there is atleast one child (max. 10 years old) and if ure nice to him you can watch him grow up, learning more languages like you do, become best friends, maybe meet one day, even if you life in other countrys, talk about differ... do i rly talk about cs:go, the game and the community? what tha  gaben, your brain is so hard... buy it, love it, hate it, i dont care, there are enough  and less non in this game, u wont make the difference.",1
"i would recommed this to all pc gamers who enjoy a fun fps. like tf2 and hats cs:go has skins which range from badass to crappy .this game runs smoothly on my notebook and on my gaming pc so the are no pc problems or requirements.",1
"this game, throughout all history is the best mulitplayer game for 1st person shooters. simple, amazing and just pure awesome. i love this game.",1
"okej...i like this game and its fun even for a noob that gets killed all the time and havent played much fps at all...but then again i still like it and hope to become better....only one thing that is wrong. why so serious ? getting kicked out couse you aint good enough...for those who do so...its a game !!! but if you can over see that...really fun game and f-them who are the kickers...",1
"i believe that cs:s has a better modding community however, my personal preference is with go all the way it is alot of fun and a great update to a fantastic series",1
"unplayable with all the hackers and they do nothing about people who cheat. (people with vac bans still play and cheat). yet they continuously put the game on sale to encourage the unlucky cheaters who got banned to get their mom to buy them a new account.",2
"just dare to do it, caman lads, you cannot understand the feeling of a huvudskott",2
"just picked it up in the winter sale and it is a very good game.",1

"if this game was a potato, it would be a good potato.",3
"30 min cooldown - got kicked too much for playing like  2 hour cooldown - got kicked for doing  1 day cooldown - internet shutdown in my neighbhorhood 7 day cooldown - played like /had to walk dog. volvo why u do this? too much cooldown",2
"this game has tooken my wallet away. i have spent over $200 in case keys, no money in return. buy keys, buy the game. 11/10",3

"y u no able to get kills with the shooty gun, im pointing that crosshair right at u?????? 10/10",1
"be a good player get called hack, be a bad player and kill yourself. 10/10 i am broke.",2
"this game is very fun and addictive. it also supports my gambling addiction by dropping cases which cost ing 2.50 dollars to open, only to get a gun that is worth 50 cents. 7/10 is my finnal score overall i would reccomend if you can handle not waisting away 30 dollars on the community market. the game would of been better without items.",2
"call of dutys sucsessful uncle that told you that a buisness major was going to take you places. yet no one can smooth talk you into buying over 30 skins and feel pro like good old uncle cs:go",1
"really great game. tactics are key. cod players f off.",4
"you either die at a or live long enough to rotate to b and then die due to no reg 101/101 would rage again",2
"its cs, what more to add than the raw awesomeness?",2
"the best game in this series. cant wait for linux version, so i can stop dual boot to this (sh)indows os",2
"nice game....remind me of my old skool memory playing cs at cc with friend while not going to school",4
"this is a good game. nice players and has realistic concepts implamented to make it a more fun experience. new skins, map and custom player made maps make the game so much fun!",2
"great game, classic shooter. really strays from the modern millitary shooters we have today. the community has a large ammount of veteran players that are often rude but the game has to go down in history as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time due to its attention to detail. where the bullet lands is an important role in this game and just because you get the jump on someone does not mean youre coming out alive.",3
"you better f*cking buy this game right now or youll never be a real gamer! cuz this is the best game of all time!",2
"so use the nova its better than most guns at most ranges i have factory new graphite stattrak named justins love pump one thousand souls taken and counting so join me wont you? and bring your nova!",2
"when the classic returns! a good game, to play with friends, and have fun. with graphics from cs source, and physics from cs 1.6 ,",1
"im just going to make this simple i played this game back when it was 1.5 i played 1.6 source then this for a little bit. but all in all the upgrades are fun the skins are addicting to collect. game all around has been improved if your a old school try this new school version out it will suck at first you will just keep dieing but all in all kicks  give it a go you will have that old competitve feeling back. random drops at the end of the game also :d..........",3
"although this game has its problems, it is an amazing game. i have spent so much time in the game and i do not regret anything, it is a little hard and confusing to get into at first, but once you get into it it is well worth the time. i would definately recommend.",1
"i love this game it is a first person shooter and its really fun you get camos and competein competitive games and loads more its on sale now so if you want his game i eould get it now!!!!!!",1
"we need 128 tick servers for the matchmaking ques!",2
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",1
"pros: -ridculously fun fps -ridiculously cheap ($3.74 on sale) -one time purchase, no addons (not counting gun skins) -unforgiving realism makes it very challenging -insane replay value cons: -learning curve is extremely steep -game becomes literally infested with hackers during sales -a lot more foreign players than u.s. players (not an issue to foreign players, of course) -unforgiving realism makes it very challenging -community isnt particularly the best one out there, but its decent verdict: between this, call of duty, battlefield, and any other fps out there (well, minus tf2), id go with this. writing this review is kind of hard because being victorious in a 1v5 situation is something that cannot be described, only experienced. counter-strike as a franchise used to be one of the biggest out there, and hopefully it regains its turf someday.",1
"this is one of those games that require studying the weapons and characteristics to be successful. it has a big learning curve but once you get it, you have a lot of fun playing it. its fantastic even though a couple things like graphics are a little out of date. if i could choose one this for them to work on in the next game it would be improving the textures and with that comes better optimization. in my mind it is a 8/10 on the multiplayer scale.",2
"one of the best games i have ever seen. worth all the money.",2
"i highly recommend the game counter-strike: global offensive to anyone looking for a shooter whether they be a casual player, a pro player, or even just looking for a game to collect skins in. the game offers up a few structured game modes (such as gun game and competitive) but thats just the tip of the iceberg. cs:go also, like its predecessors, boasts a community server browser which opens the game up to a world of game modes whether it be playing as a prisoner in jail or surfing on walls. the game has great mechanics which really give you the opportunity to explore your inner shooter. an additional feature is the skin store, where you can purchase or sell gun camos for real life money. ive personally made about 20 bucks from all the buying and selling ive done, but if you arent looking to pay then it has no real effect on the game. for the amount this game costs youd be crazy not to give it a shot and even meet some friendly players among the counter-strike community. 9.5/10",1
"got teabagged by a teammate and got killed by a chicken and next round by a wall... 10/10",1
"why you reading this when you could be playing cs go go play it now or else 110/100",2
"first of all all know counter strike is the most popular game online for all the time and this counter strike: global offensive is superb with more realistic guns and maps .. jst loved the game very very addictive game! <3 :)",1
"count-strike: global offensive is a great modern revamp of the old counter-strike series, this game is amazing and its worth every penny and will go great along any other counter-strike game.",1
"cs:go is the successor to the popular css title. with the requirement of extreme precision, witts, and money conservation, this game will be known for years to come. this game is not only for the competitive or hardcore gamer... cs:go has casual lobbies where i myself have made alot of friends as i learned the game. the friendly nature of players offers a benefit to both casual and competitve players allowing great communication and cooperation. on top of the games stellar mechanics and community, cs:go offers a huge variety of in-game purchases for skins and maps that never require real money purchases, ever. you recieve drops as rounds end that can be traded with other players for their skins, or sold on the market for steam wallet funds. a game i can play for hours on end with personalization that i can buy with money i earned within the game is something that truly makes this title stand out 10 out of frickin 10 i recommend fully that you play this game good job, valve",2
"this game is fantastic, ive played about 48 hours and i just love it. its nearly impossible to get kills when you first start, this is because its such an addicting game, people play it for ages. i love it as a player who has never played any other counter strike. if you have not played any counter strike, i am tellingyou to buy this bloody great game! if u have played counter strike, then i cant say to u cause you would be more experienced than me",3
"i played since cs 1.5 and this game is a huge improvement. better graphics better sound, better hostage system, better weapon balance and finally a good hitbox. and some new game modes that are fun too.",2
"counter-strike: global offensive is the best game to buy on steam atm. it has everything that you would want from a game: no pay2win! ofcourse you can buy things but those things give no advantages. like skins. the awp asiimov doesnt give you +100% rate of fire or something, its only for a decoration. cs:go is right now my second most played game on steam. this game is super fun but it does have some problems, like the 64 tick servers! 64 tick servers are mostly valve servers. sometimes you hit the dude 30 times and only does about 19 dmg. not spraying. thats why you should play on community servers like altpug, faceit or something. not esea. but if you want to pay for a company to mine bitcoins with your graphics card go ahead! have fun! otherwise the game is perfect. 10/10 recommend buying on a sale. not for the full price ;d if you buy it on a sale then buy some keys and crates and try to get a knife. :d i also reccomend watching warowls videos on how to improve. helped me a lot!",4
"absouletly one of the best fps games out there! there are some flaws with this game, like servers crashing and staying down for like 1-2 days, and of course, your usual hackers...... but other than that, this game is amazing! id recommend this to any one interested in realistic, fun, and competitive fps games. p.s. if you rage easily, i dont think you should play this game....",4
"great game. its unbalanced, full of hackers and the developer doesnt want to listen to customers, but its still a great game. its unlimited hours of fun.",3
"iz loove playing this gamez with my friends because it brings me so much happieness to watch them play ing horribly and being scrubs getting wrecked by the shitest teams going but yeah i still play with matty chibati prawn boi slim and some  with boggley eyes why you ask hmmmmmm i dont ing know.",3
"brilliant game, a lot of fun. keeps you entertained with the various game modes and the different guns always creates something you can get better at.",1

"i adore the game as its features are different.nicer job valve! :d",2
"i just wasted $3.52 on useless skins that dont improve your skills or weapons at all. i love this game.",1
"cs: go stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longevity and variety. valve has not only updated the shooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries. this is counter-strike, whatever the format you choose to play it on, and there isnt a higher recommendation than that.",2
"counter-strike has always held a special place in my heart, so it may be hard to speak without bias. that being said, if you are looking for a competative first person shooter, this is your game. it is no call of duty where blood distorts your view, its no battlefield with explosions all around you, it is a highly refined competative first person shooter, the phrase easy to learn, hard to master could not apply anymore to this game, the controls are simple, the maps are easy to learn, but the tacticts, teamwork, recoil compensation, and economy are something that may take you years to master. the game has a huge competative scene with multiple tournaments with prize rewards in the hundreds of thousands every year. the difficulty of the game, and the rewarding feel of getting an ak-47 headshot are something that never go away, highly recommend 10/10.",4
"i would highly recommend this game, at first its really hard but stick at it",1
"absolutely frustrating aiming mechanics . gg will play again for reasons i dont understand.",1
"its a great game with a super high skill cap. a million times better and more rewarding than any cod or bf game. the only downside is that the pinion servers suck . fix em gaben pls.",1
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",1
"this is not cs anymore, it is more like call of duty... so newbs can hop in more quickly.",2
"is a nice game and i enjoyed it, have nice graphics and i recommend to other peoples.",2
"cool stuff,improved my recoil control. no doubt the graphics are flawless. good work.. regards, halcon~",3
"awesome! :d also a good way of making money in steam ;)",3
"great game, although i would like to see a russian filter adapted. russians, russians everywhere.",5
"i love this game, but watch out because it is a very bad game when it comes to spending money on the game after you already own it to buy the skins you want!",2
"new cs after 12 years? doesnt get better than this.",1
"this is way better than 1.6 or source. both 1.6 and source are full of hackers, this one has too, but less. go also adds molotovs and decoys which is pretty cool. this version also has much better graphics and improved maps, which keeps me playing even more, because graphics do matter. gameplay stays faithful to the original 1.6, which is really great because theres lots of 1.6 players that moved on to this version. it also runs great on old hardware. rating: 9/10 if there were less hackers, it would be 10. (and yes, the awp is still 1-shot kill. .)",1
"to be good, you need to have the best skins. you need to have a knife and a ak47 vulcan and 2 asiimovs to actually play the game, thats the only way you are going to be good.",1
"i had so much fun playing this game with my friends if you got tired of first person shooters like cod, battlefield etc, this is a very good break from that gameplay.",1
"its so much fun to suck at this game. buy it now.",1
"a great game to play with friends, some games can be great but others can be spoilt by cvheaters and smurf accounts. all in all a good game to get into. the create opening system is good as well even though it is quite expensive it makews it more fun and enjoyable.",3
"bought the game for $3.74. made $650. 10/10 would buy again.",1
"theres no killstreaks and no sprinting? wtf this game is trash 0/10 get cod ghosts if you wanna play a real fps",1
"tried a 360 noscope, didnt work even after a million tries. 10/10 best game.",2
"this is the ultimate competitive fps. well other then that you will learn atleast 10 other languages, new and inovative curse words. you will need anger management, a lot of free time and money. you will feel rewarded for every kill and every victory but you will face rage and frustration when a loss happens. *note: you may become racist.*",3
"counter-strike: global offensive is just as fun as the previous iterations of counter-strike while including realistic settings and modern matchmaking tools.",2
"best shots of all time. i shoot and shotot so many hs and bnow they say me i am hax??? dis is not nice",2
"even tho the game is great, we need to definatly have a better cheat detect system",3
"best fps game on steam for sure, alot of hours killed during playing it. not that bad community, some players can be toxic and flame ofc but you just have to deal with that ^^ worth buying it, this will stay as top rated and most played game for a long long time :) ratings: 8.5/10",2
"when you kill chickens, they turn into a dust cloud of feathers and dust. 1337/10",1
"what do i expect from a cs? lots of fun and tactical gameplay. since cs.go grants these, its as good as any cs before. its ofc a change from cs:s to cs:go because they made recoil changes and so on, but come on, its time for change as gold ol obama would say, so get up, train hard or die tryin. good luck!",1
"cs go is a fedorable game the only problem i have with it is that there is not enough fedoras actually there is none which is a disgrace us gentlemen deserve to atleast have fedoras in the game but over all i would give this game 9fedoras/10",1

"if you have 100 spare mouses, and a few extra keyboards laying around, and in some cases monitors. this is the game for you! this game is full of 14 year olds that dont know how to shoot you anywhere but right between your eyes, and do it in 1/10th of a second. this game will make you rage, it will make you qq, and yes, it will even make you commit murder to a poor defenceless mouse. ( you monster) despite that, the game is fun because of its challenging gameplay. when you get a kill you feel good. when you get 3 kills you feel great. when you get mvp you feel proud. this is a game best played in doses. play for 1 hour, leave, comeback. change servers if you get pwnt. chances are the next one ( will be even worse ) not as bad. plus, unlike cod, this game lacks (mostly) 8 year old swear to be cool uber l33t s.",1
"awesome game that you could earn money from and its lovly <3",1
"better than payday, but not as satisfying as rainbow six (for you tactical ops fans like me). still, a fun and more realistic team based shooter than most.",1
"i recommend counter-strike: global offensive its good action game and also need good reaction so this game is pretty sweet. and i wanna say thanks to valve and other cs:go game makers for this game. and i recommend this game how i said and there can be a lot of fun and also this game is awesome and yeah.",1
"what to write as a review for this game... well, i started playing cs:go just a few days ago with my bf and so far i have been called: fing idiot, r3tard and they even unsuccessfuly tried to kick me out of the server lol i never knew that only macho guys with tiny d!cks played this game >.< they all seem to think they are pros, even though, they know, for a fact, theyre playing with/against noobs who are trying to learn and improve. oh and did i mention they sure as hell cant play with girls?! what a bunch of cavemen m0rons. so yeah, i hope you find this helpful.",1
"destroys friendships and youll get screamed at every 2 minutes. like dota with guns.",2
"amazing game very addictive, go for it you will have a lot of fun!",3
"its a little hard to understand the game at first but as you play it longer and longer it gets easy",1
"great game for what its worth. i have made alot of friends through this game over the past 10 years. highly recommend!",4
"i recommend this game only on certain parameters. if youre looking for a story, theres none i could find. theres pratically an economy on this game as in people will spend outrageous amounts of actual money on such as gun skins. it has....interesting shooting mechanics to say the least, not your standard shooter, but thats what makes it funner. like shooting people in the face(ak only)? this is probably the game for you and probably already in your library somewhere.",1
"very very very fun game, definitely worth the price.",2
"very fun and competitive would be one of my favorite games. 1 game could be your best ever and the next could be your wrost.",2
"10/10  1.6, go to hell source, go is the king now!",1
"an incredibly fun fps that is well worth the price. however, keep in mind that this fps is completely different from other shooters like cod or battlefield. if youre going to treat cs:go like such, youre going to have a bad time. imo, cs:go has a much higher learning curve compared to these fpses ive mentioned and youre probably going suck when you first start. however, once you pass this learning curve, getting kills will be much more satisfying in this game compared to getting kills in cod/bf. 10 chickens/10 would recommend.",1
"very good game, the game is very balanced and fun to play with friends except reblg ledaren and russian people since they dont speak much english.",4
"after playing over 190 hours of this game i suppose id better give a review for it. the gameplay of this game is extraordinary - the whole game is, like all counter-strike games, completely multi-player, meaning that the valve team can spend 100% of their time working on the game and making it run fine, instead of faffing around with a single-player campaign 5% of players will bother to play past the first level. the community, however... its terrible. but if you just realise that this is a $15us game, dont really take any offense to the little kids, theyre everywhere (but more so on call of duty). to summarize, this games excellent, buy it. now.",2
"this game is quite challenging a bit,but the weapons skin are all beast. definitely recommended. but raging is sometimes possible of happening if you lose too much,or die. overall 10/10",1
"amazing game. i love the chickens and how there feathers fly after you have stabbed them. the chickens (pure evil) must all be killed. ign 8/8 love the chickens m8 this game even runs on my computer that has an integrated graphics card.",1
"game is good, fun, etc. rank system doesnt work. call of duty havent rank system and is more balanced than counter- strike! smurfers everywhere.",2
"chasing chieves today....played counter strike >10 years ...best tactical shooter. gabe is a troll though...keys cost way too much and my thirst for skins has put me out hundreds of well spend dollars on keys :)",1
"game that breaks all the time. if you want to waste all you time trying to fix this , then good luck, your more likely to find a cure for cancer, ebola and aids at the same time then fixing this piece of trash.  valve",4
"counter-strike: global offensive (cs:go) would have to be one of my favorite games on steam or out of all valve games! i love all the counter-strike games but when i played this i fell in love at first sight! such nice gameplay the weapons are beautiful! i love collecting, i love to open up crates and cross my fingers for a good random gun! the game i was really impressed with! the teamwork and stratergy of the game is great as well! the graphics are nice not to bad.... i score this game 11/10",1
"getting called a smurf when you win and a noob when you lose... 10/10",1
"have you ever felt excited and frustrated at the same time or laughed and then felt like punching the closest wall to you? well if not this is the game for you! counter strike global offensive has a continuously growing player base and incredible content that updates monthly. it is similar to the other cs games so i wont dive into all that but in short its a must if you like a well balanced competitive shooter.",5
"ive spent too much time playing this game and im going to spend more in the future -- its decent game lol",4
"best fps ive played to date. i couldnt really complain this game requires all skill and cheaters are pretty much for the most part are non-existent. lacks some features that modern day shooters have but honestly the gameplay literally just beats any shooter ive ever played so i cant complain. if you are looking for a game that is based on strict skill than this game is for you. but be warned, its not for everyone. personally, ive had a few friends try the game but they rely on over-powered weapons and even cheats to play the game. also if you decide to pick up this game you will learn fluent russian in about a week. im not kidding. 5/5 : best shooter ive ever played to date.",2
"goes on a rampage mass case unboxing gets $0.1 skins, friend unboxes 5 cases and gets a knife on his third one :( rage simulator 10/10 gaben",1
"i just wish this game had a story line its always like why are we here? why are we fighting these terrorist? why are they blowing up these tcrates?",3
"its an amazing competitive game with friendly players, as you get higher up the ranking the people get a bit more serious, but there still great to talk to. the only critisizme is the cool down system, where if you leave a competitive match you will recieve a 30 min, 24 hour or a 7 day ban, sometimes this is justified, but other times, for instance when you get timed out, and connot rejoin, and then recieve a 7 day ban. this has happned to me 4 times, all there fault. all in all a fantastic game though.",3
">see a guy >shoot him >miss every shot >he turns around >kills me in one shot >exit cs:go 10/10",1
"it is a really good team playing fps. if you have 1,99 euro hurry to buy it. great game",3
"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",4
"this game is lots of fun. its not your typical run and gun cod clone, however. cs:go requires tactics, teamwork and lots of skill. i would recommend this game to anybody who likes to play first person shooters. its worth every cent of the $15 price tag.",1
"awesome game but very less servers in my counter like only 3 or 4 which remain full all the time but this game is good",1
"its a good game up until theres any sort of sale. then you have to avoid it like the plague because thats when all the smurfs and hackers come out to play. i feel like this is the sort of game that just shouldnt be on sale. but overall the community is very competative and overall decent.",2
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",1
"this game is so much fun its always being updated making it better, and the skins! there just great.",3
"a strategically team-based first person shooter. requires teamwork and fun to play",1
"i cant believe i havent reviewed this game earlier. counter strike: global offensive is one of the best if not the best tactical fps in the world. as i am writing this review, they are hosting a tournament for it.(dreamhack(go nip!)) whats to like about cs:go: well other than being a noob when you first start and getting yelled at in competitive lots!!! as soon as you start you are given an easy menu to navigate, an amazing setup for your inventory, and tons of stuff you can learn about cs:gos past in the side bar. now when first starting i would highly not recommend playing competitive. id say go with a few rounds of casual to get at least the feel of it and then try your skills at competitive. competitive is not a place to mess around in, says 1237 other people playing competitive. other than that yeah! go buy yourself a bundle of cs:go!",2
"dont get me wrong counter strike is the best. but when you are better than your rank and you ge teams that are jokes and you cant level up it makes you want to quit the game because every chance you get to level some jerk messes it up. i quit for this reason.",2
"i love this game its one of the most fun games i play atm",2
"besides being incredibley addicting, cs:go also packs weapon skins, and stickers to customize your weapons, cs:go is casual fun, except most players take it to seriously, if youre looking for a fps shooter to play, this one definintly conquers other games like cod, linear, but fun.",2
"fun game for sure, but the matchmaking system is heavily flawed with their anti-cheat being extremely weak. if you happen to play thru esea though it is much better. i feel this game will be significantly upgraded when the new source engine comes out (providing they update the game with it). overall though id say 8/10.",3
"i really like this game it gets really addicting once you play it.",2
"this is the most cool game! i love counter-strike and i like cs:go too! i recommend this game!",3
"probably the best fps out there, basically anyone can play it on any computer, its cheap and competitive is amazing :d. really suggest getting it!",3
"good game if you.. want to play for a long time rekt people rank up opponents get too hard get another copy rekt more people repeat..",1
"i got a one week ban because the host was downloading gilf porn on his grandmas dial up internet. 10/10 would play again!",1
"for those who havent played this, an amazing quote for u if you havent played cs go yet, your a dog with no life. - me",1
"very difficult to play at times but hey probably one of the most fun ive had playing a game on here in a long time  opening cases i always get that ass tec-9 issac wheres my ing knife",1
"wasted months of my life on this game. 10/10 would do again.",5
"its really nice fps, if you was plaing cs 1.6 you must try it.",1
"great game! its a typical cs game but with better graphics. it has many mods, zombie one is my faviroit :d, and the other mods you find other cs games like deathmatch and so on. this game is propably the best game you can buy for this prise. defenitly deserves the moeny you pay for it.",5
"cs:go is a big improvememnt from cs:s. its way more fun than cs:s and looks way better.",1

"this game made me yell at my friends. 10/10 would video game",4
"another valve-going-to-be-classic, very demanding skill-wise, potentially addictive , but also a blast and (occasionally ) rewarding. there are some issues with the server capacity because of the rapidly growing community, the valve anticheat-system (vac) is not on par with current skill enhancing programs and skins became more or less the main reason for many players to not abandon global offensive. if you like tactic-shooters and especially other cs-titles, the only thing in your way of enjoying this game is being prejudiced....(or fukd up servers volvo pls). [x/10] [insert] [funny] [ign]",2
"it is an improved counter-strike over source, but there are a large number of problems. getting kicked out of competitive or leaving in the middle of the round can result in a time-out, accuracy problems, hardware problems and more. however it is still counter-strike from deep within, and i like playing it. it just needs to be a little bit reworked.",3
"very extremely fun and addicting fps . you will never get bored playing csgo. great maps / guns to choice from. you will always meet great and annoying people ingame . like i said very addicting",1
"if you wantings to spend all your money on virtual guns this is the gem for you",1
"skill based game. dont hack and feel free to join :d",2
"the best online shooters saga history returns with an addictive great game and renovated with multiple modes and game options. the graphic draws attention especially on maps and are quite varied, recognize old maps with amazing quality graphics. the game is constantly updated with maps, passes, community contributions ... etc, extending the life of brutal game. highly recommended if you like shooters.",3
"crashes every 20 mins crash simulator highly recommended++",1
"if you are a cod fan boy i dont recommend buying this!",1
"we must embrace the pain and burn it as fuel for our journey.",3
"if youre a fan of call of duty, buy the new ones at release, fanboy over it, then you should go out to gamestop and trade in every single one of those games and pick up a quality fps. this one. plus killing a chicken in deathmatch gets you +1 point. 10/10",2
"very fun game, i would see myself playing this alot with my friends; feels like what cod should have been with the added laughs from deaths and the fun and cool looking level design. i would definitely recommend. 8/10 very good.",1

"some german guy was screaming that i was a  some russian dude was screaming in russian overall it was fun",1
"10/10 - the original crack at its best. just watch out for that counter-strike depression, its the worst.",1
"very good game! just a tip: never play with random team in ranked game.",2
"theres an old saying i heard somewhere that said if someone calls you a cheater in an online game when youre actually not cheating, you win the game. i won at this game. 5/5. balls of steel required.",2
"not your typical hack and slash game uncomparable to the call of duty franchise. without team work theres is a fine margin for success. a player must be constantly aware of his enviroment, understanding the locations of surrounding vantage points and flank routes. one must also have the ability to listen for footsteps and with that information you can deduce an enemies location.global offensive also offers a wide variety of weapon skins allowing you to customize your weapons for a more pleasurable experience.so far i have yet to meet a hacker and cs:go remains suspensful and exciting at every turn of the corner. ps: whatever you do, dont peak an awp",4
"freakin excellent fps game. recommended for ppl who like to shoot.",1
"a very fun and addicting tactical shooter. the fact that it includes gun skins which you can find, trade and make money on makes it even more enjoyable.",1
"this game is better than counter strike 1.6 and much better than cs:source. it is very addicting with the match making part of the game.",5
"seriously nice game with an epic graphical touch to the original version. plus the drop and mm is very cool. would recommend to anyone with a good enough gpu :d",3
"one day while playing comp. internet crashes for 1 second and comes back and cant connect back to the server 7 day ban. 7 days later plays a game with full russian team gets kicked 7 day ban. great 7 day wait simulator.",1

"best competitive fps-game at this moment, must buy.",1
"men in spendex in a tight spot with tight weapons.. what more to say?",1
"this game is pretty fun to get into. at first it takes a lot of learning, starting with maps and guns then to callouts and team tactics. the learning curve does tend to be harsh but if you hop into competitive and get a league, you should be able to play enjoyably. this game is also a great game to play with friends!",2
"this game has taught me a lot of things. i will sum them up: 1. you can shoot with guns. 2. if you run and shoot your bullets fly everywhere. 3. if you run and die your body falls. 4. throwing grenades often leads into your team getting damage. 5. silvers rage a lot. 6. you can shoot. i hope this was helpfull for everyone.",1

"bull  . ive had to reinstall so many times because of  steam programmers. so pathetic",2

"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",4
"so much better than cs 1.6. it gives you a chance to play with people that are on the same level with you and it is only a bonus that you dont have to look for new servers!",2
"so fun, especially in custom servers like minigames or jailbreak. great new game modes compared to old counter strike games. not so long ago, they implemented a skins update where people (and valve) make a profit from all the skins they sell and trade with each other. its a great way to show yourself to others through skins. (and to show that you can afford some or to brag :p)",3

"csgo is the best fps game for me . csgo>battlefield>cod>etc. csgo for lyf :)",1
"i really do have a love hate relationship with this game. withthe right people it can be amazing fun. gameplay is great and easy to pickup but will take some time to master. i recoomend this to anyone interested in a tactical fps.",2

"its like trying to steal a baby cub from a mother bear wearing a meat suit",5
"its pretty worth it. i thought cod4 or bf4 would take my time but theres something about the competitive atmosphere in ranked in csgo thats worth coming back to all the time especially with friends. anyway get the game join us!",4

"awesome game. really like the idea of it and cool skins.",2
"got the game and free russian swear words lessons. update: i can speak fluent russian. 11/10 would buy again.",2
"the best competive fps on the pc at the moment. a high skill ceiling may turn off some people, but for those who are determined to push on, prepare for an insanely satisfying multiplayer shooter. if you think you were good at call of duty, youre in for a challenge, because this isnt anything like it. if youre new to counter strike, expect to sink in around 200+ hours before you actually get decent at this game.",2

"cs go is like mcdonalds commercial im loving it >:)",2
"very nice competitive game but you should watch some youtube vids of it before playing",2
"pretty damn good job valve! as a fanatic 1.6 player, i think cs:go its a well made update to this classic. i mean, the phisics and graphics did changed a lot but they did it tastefully and right. im very pleased with the competitive matchmaking system, i think it was about time we cut out the intermediary (see playzeek/gathernetwor/etc.). all in all, i think cs:go will keep me in front of my monitor at least as much as 1.6 did.",1
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",1

"this game is the next level of shooters, when i first started playing this game i had no idea what type of fun i was getting into. the game provides team communication which is the most important feature in this. if youre bad at shooters, this game helps you get better. it will teach you how to aim, when to shoot, and how to be a team player. without this game i would be a really bad sniper, and team leader. this is a must have game.",1
"been playing the counter strike series by valve for about 10 years now, pretty great series imo. definitely better than call of doodoo, halo and battlefield 10/10 would buy.",3

"awesome ! i love it ! <3 but this rank-up system is terrible....",3
"from cs 1.5 to cs:go,great game with friends,no glitches,or  like that,has hackers but so far i played against 1.",3
"its a good follow up to the classic counter-strike 1.6. game feels good and have been improved together with the professional teams. the only downside is that you cannot choose region or language and some problems occur as follows. russians mostly are matched up with english speaking players, and they have overall bad english or no english at all. the valve servers currently run at 64tickrates/second wich makes the competitive match making abit luck based sometimes. cdkeys are very cheap in russia and this is a problem when many players abuse it to cheat with a n account. skins on weapons and knifes are really good and brings some trading into it wich makes the community flourish around this aspect aswell.",3
"this game has tooken my wallet away. i have spent over $200 in case keys, no money in return. buy keys, buy the game. 11/10",3
"im so mad right now because i was put on to a cooldown for kicking a guy who was afk and would have been kicked in the first place, but that being said, the game is great to play with friends or just to cool down after a stressful day 10/10",1
"its cs.its my childhood memories.de_vertigo,de_dust and de_inferno.. i just hope they bring back the classic vip maps from cs 1.4 :(",1
"this game is so great it will have you spending hundreds of dollars on it. the skins are flawless and will over charge you for simple shapes. you want a knife? you need to spend thousands to get one! you want a ak vulcan? good luck scraping the hundreds of dollars together to get one! they are that good.",3
"okay... so maybe itll take you a couple months to leave silver. okay... so maybe the community is quite toxic thanks to people whos nationality starts with r and uses letters normal humans dont understand. but this game is a great game to relax in the casual gameplay modes, show off your camoes or try to trade them up on the lounge or play with your friends or the inhuman russians in competitive. personally, this game has taught me teamwork, greatly improved my reactions, how to think under pressure and how to work as a team. and obviously how to deal with satanists. as a gamer who has never owned a cod game, i dont really have the right to compare them, but from what i know, cs:go requires skill (and or luck) whereas cod requires a console and no friends. would r8 8/8",2
"really great game that is a lot of fun. i normally hate fps games such as cod and battlefield, but the tactcal aspect of this game keeps bringing me back. the only issue is that there is the occasional troll on a team, but usually not a problem. 9/10",2
"everything that counter-strike source offered but even better especially with the recent arms deal update which allows you to collect skins for your guns.",3
"in my opinion, this game is still very young and undeveloped and all the hate against russians is stupid. i mean im not one to talk here i hate them sometimes aswell. i realised something when i was playing one day, the game has gone trough a lot of changes and that it was slowly turning into a moba like game, where rank is more importand than having fun. how valve changed cs for me made me yonder and ponder from the time when i was playing cs 1.6 or css. back then there where no rankings nor matchmaking and the servers where flooded with ads. i really hate how people neglect the times when people were fun to play with. now people only care about how big your rank is, and how expensive your skins are. where are the good old times? to me this game is a mess because of the ranking system and i mustnt recommend it for players from cs 1.6 or css. sure there are different mods, but people mostly play competitive and try to force their rank down your throat.",2
"no enought lens flare, quite alot of drug use which is good for children~~~ at least 7 cabbages smoked and bonged recomend although you cant enject kemamin in your eye un realistic []",3

"although i picked up this game with a bit of reluctance, im proud to say that i am sufficiently surprised by how detailed and fun this game can be. the competitive mode is like an addiction almost.",3
"great game, so fun, so addicting. i found it boring at first but then when you start playing competitive it gets really fun",2
"elegantaro remember polish is not the same as russia",3
"while the multiplayer isnt very fun, the campaign entitled competitive provides an enchanting story with such great dialogue as fk u u  hacker and can sum1 buy me p90 pls. the story brings an intense buildup as the counter terrorists search for campers and accuse the enemies of hacking upon death. you will cry as a player disconnects due to rage over an online game, and you will laugh at the expense of others. 10/10 game would play again.",1
"tryst is a pretty huge  for putting pine cones up his  to prove his love for cs:go",2
"a very well done game. i have spent a while playing this game and like it much more than other popular first person shooters (e.g call of duty). the players are normally very helpful, polite, and mature. be warned, start playing and you might not be able to stop. 10/10 would play again.",3
"this game has survived for this long and here is the reason why. its a simple game that requires tremendous skill and knowledge of the map and the people that you are playing with. its great for all types of gamers casual and competitive and i personally give it 2 thumbs way up and would recommend to anyone looking for a phenomenal fps game to play! keep up the good work counter strike!",2

"okey i did not play 1.6 or source (i did play source but only surf and jail so i dont feel like it counts). so my skill level wasnt that high when i entered the game, and i did not like it at the begining because the steep learning curve, but after i got my first rank (silverelitemaster) i was hooked, i stopt playing my main game at the time (leauge of legends).over the course of 6 months ive been playing csgo for non stop and for good reasons.the game is purely skill based and thats what i liked about it. you could go 1v3 and still win the round if you had the skill. and ill be honest when csgo came out (2012) i did not like the game at all because it felt like something was missing, they didnt have the classic colt with silencer or the usp. luckly they added the colt with silencer (m4a1-s) and the usp along with match making. and i do belive this was the reason csgo became so huge. and this is why i love valve they listen to the community, they even add skins which are community made on the workshop.",3
"the only bad thing about it is that everyone else is better than you. and that those people are likely to be  about it. and theyll most probably be using an awp (a one shot sniper pretty much anywhere in the body). but other than that its cool.",1

"by looking at the amount of positive and negative reviews you can come to several conclusions. 1. (and most obvious one) this game is pretty good. 2. a lot of people play it. 3. you will be addicted to the game, after playing several hours! why? because this game may not be the fastest paced game, may not have the best graphics, may cause you to be jealous of others, because they have paints on their guns (also called skins) in the value of more hundred euros, it may even cause you to sabotage your pc by raging, but the satysfaction shooting others while using teamwork, finesse and map knowledge and killing them is so satisfying, like in no other game!",2

"ladies and gentlemen, the newest addition to the series that is the father of all fps games. this game has been updated in lots of fun ways such as custom skins, weapon drops. developers also made the arms race (gun game) mode official and added a built in competitive mode. even with all these knew things the game still plays out just as well as its predecessors. 10/10 definitetly a must buy.",1

"if you like games due to their competitive focus, cs:go is great for this. ive been a devout halo 3 player since 2008, and loved the competitive focus. its one of the very few games that kept my interest for many years. cs:go will probably do the same.",5

"it may lack some of the community nicest, beloved maps (assault, anyone?), and little features of past games, but global offensive delivers on the promise of a faithful, polished, and better looking counter-strike for whoever wants it. even if the community doesnt meet the golden standard of 1.6 and source, cs:go will remain a multiplayer classic for those willing to put in the time to learn the maps and weapons.",1

"though i cannot say this is the best counter-strike game because i havent played the first 2 cs games, this is still a great game. i love the add on of skins and the updated maps are great. this will easily be the largest cs game in history. i just cant wait to see what big update will happen next. the only thing right now that i dont like is that this game doesnt run as well as other source games. still a fantastic game.",3

"fun game, cheap especially when on sale. regular item drops. only problem is players starting out will have a little trouble in the main online play as the majority of players are very experienced. other than that, really fun to play on your own or with friends.",1
"i really like this game. but i hate all the cheaters.",4
"fantastic game overall. it has a relatively easy learning curve even for a gamer who doesnt play first person shooters or rpgs. love it.",1
"very nice game. i love to trade and rate new skins. and i like the frequently updates.",2
"game is full of hackers that bought the game on alternate accounts during sales, especially in competitive matches and of course theres no way of proving it unless you can watch the replay or recorded the match. 0/10 would not recommend unless you hack too.",2
"a very interesting game, alot of practice is needed to master the art of aiming and you probs wanna keep your wallet hidden away due to its tempting weapon options.",1

"garbage mm servers, hackers, 99 in 3 hits, rage mode always active, 10/10 would play again",5
"although i feel this game is a bit limited in the gamemodes that are available for normal gameplay mode (ctf would be fun for example), the game feels fun and refreshing. the only downside is the strange hitbox system that counterstrike uses.",1
"probably the best game i have ever played! got to meet a lot of players! the graphics are killer! the feel of an upgraded counter strike 1.6! im in love with this game <3",2
"if you are looking to get addicted to betting, and trading you cant go wrong here. very fun",1
"altough not as entertaining as its predecesser counter strike: source, ive had hours of fun playing this game i stille enjoy cs source but i was looking for something newer to add to my library. the game has still has the feeling of the classic counter strike but with quite a few more wepons, wepon variants and community created gun camos maps and player modles. cs:go also has a few new game modes such as team death match and demolition (of course keeping the classic game modes of hostage rescue and planting/disarming the bomb. it also is a primarly a competitive game so its a litte tougher and there less modded gamemodes such as zombie escape but they do still exist. over all i have had alot of fun in this game enjoy a renewed verson of the older games. 9/10!",1
"counetr strike is a bit hard to get into, but when you step foot into the battlefield the game seems to just get better. may be better if they made beginner lobbies, but oh well, start to walk before you can crawl.",2
"its been so long since i started playing this and yet i cant think of a proper review. this game is awesome, this game is my crack recently, my life. i know there are lifeless nerds with 2000+ hours in there, and they might think that my playtime is nothing at all, but i rarely spend more than a 200 hours in a single game. why do i love it so much? ive got no clue. could be the competitive edge, the skills that you need to be succesful, the teamwork. im a newcomer to the whole steam and valve stuff, so cs:go was the first cs game i ever played, and i still love it now. definitely recommended to anyone out there, but if you are used to cod or quake (i love this one), prepare to rage a lot when you cant shot and move without getting headshotted.",3
"if you like team work based game try csgo. it pretty fun in my case i love teamwork based games and i love csgo!",3
"immersive gameplay, decked out in skins and chickens.",2
"such a great game; where can i start? first of all, cs:go is a fast paced game involving terrorist and counter terrorist teams. at no point will you find yourself bored in the middle of a match, because of how small the maps are. in classic mode you have about 3 minutes maximum of game time per round, just to give you a taste of the action. anyway, just buy it now",3
"very well contruscted game. much more complicated than it seems at first, just gotta dig down deep and youll find out just how complex this game is. very fun.",1
"i play many games but, this is one i keep coming back to. it has by far the most hours i have in a game, and the time i have put into this game is well worth it. its a must buy to anyone who want to play a real game.",3
"a little different than 1.6 but it has its perks. very good gameplay but if on steam servers watch out for the 64 tick. great game overall.!",4
"really good game! i play everyday! :) i got kniffffff and im so happy about dat! :)",5
"i spend 900$ in this game very nice. if youre bad at the game(low skill in the matchmaking system) its not very fun to play considering the lack of tactics and gamesense, the higher ranking you get the more fun it becomes. with the exeption of lem+. this is because in global elite 10% of players are cheaters = 1 everygame. it also has great community gamemodes as minigames, surf, bhop, kz. 9/10. needs better anti-cheat and higher tickrate for it to become a 10. but you can play on cevo, faceit or esea and get mostly cheat free servers with better tickrates.",4
"very fun and entertaining game. i like being called a  and noob by global elites. i also like wasting money on buying skins and cases. i reccomend you buy this if you dont have it!",4
"this game is probably one of the best $15 dollars ive spent in a long time. there are many aspects of this game, ranging from highly competetive play, to community servers. it can be frustrating at times, and there is a moderate learning curve for new players, but if you get the hang of it, then you can really have a lot of fun with this game.",2
"needs to fix their matchmaking................ (competitive) never go on ing sale a ing gain too many ing hackers ing worst teams in comp. gg cs gg *these are the only bad things. *i love everything else about it though <3",3
"one of the best fps out there! really addictive and fun!...",2
"csgo is love. csgo is life. seriously though, csgo is really a fantastic multiplayer fps. you really do have to think about what you are doing in order to be successful, although there is a lots that could be improved and fixed but hey, dont all games?",2
"game is awesome !just stupid things when u kill teamate u get ban or when u leave the match...",3
"this is a highly tactical, team-oriented game in which you and your friends will execute brilliant plays against your enemies. a common tactic is to find a dark corner with an awp and masturbate furiously until you die.",1
"havent had this much fun since since wolfenstein enemy territory",3
"when you first start this game you might be intimidated by the skill of some players. just remember that no one but you has a life and they are hacking if they kill you. always rage at the top player, always.",1
"it has its up and downs but overall its a great game!",2
"awesome fps game if you are into one that requires skill and strategies. i rate this game 10/10 awesome game to have fun on!",3
"i cannot get enough of this game. i have been playing since 1.6! worth checking it out.",2
"better then cod and bf3/4 its about skill tactics domination and luck teamplay victory and defeat. community support. vac-secure servers compentative matchmaking allways updated with new features 10/10",4

"addicting gameplay, nice graphics and endless fun.",1
"did you enjoy cs 1.6 and found all the follups to be a bit different? well go brought back the classic feel with modern interface and active support and a thriving community, it is awesome.",4
"this game is amazing i wish it didnt have any hackers on it or people who cheat to ruin the game",4
"this is the best strategy game ive ever played! i recommend this for everyone that likes fps games! (better than cod, kids)",3
"pros: great game you can earn steam wallet from it(getting skins, crates, etc. and selling it on steam market) same classic counter strike game, just new graphics competitive matchmaking cons: retar*** community lack of movable props(source had barrels, crates, etc.) 8 shots to body=1 shot to head. russians and their micspam overall, i would recommend to buy it, since you can make money from it, and for the competitve. its way more better than a normal 24 players game where everyone shots everyone. in competitive 5vs5, you have to think, strategic, how to defeat you opponents. the bad news is that mostly your teammates arent smart at all, and do absolute nonsense. anyway, you can avoid that by making a 5 people team. then you are not matched with a morons, and you can think with your friends. but if you just want a regular, fun counter strike, i would recommend to buy counter strike:source.",3
"this game enhances your nerves. you get into matchmaking with all kind of russians with 200 ping.",1
"this game made me realize how much i suck at fpss. everyday i would log on and get berated by friends. sniper is hard af to use. 5 starts",1
"even tho i was in first place my team still called me a noob and shouted russian words at me. 9/10.",1
"my life was in shambles. my wife had left me. my parents casted me out of my house. my kids starving and begging for food. then i found counterstrike. the game ran so smooth on my  computer. a supreme race of next gen gaming for such a outdated pc. with the simple press to speak mic keys i wouldnt have to hear my loud  ing kids beg me for more food. i could hear only what i wanted to hear. i think theyre dead now but that just means more time for counterstrike. its truly a game for the gods. overall i give it a 8/10",1
"hi iam 34 year man from somalia. i play this game to improv but tis not very good. first wen i start i do competitive and people tell go to b so i go to the b on teh wal. they then yell at me for look at wall ?? why the fk did they ask if they are just yell at me ??? also when iam start plae da gaem ppl keep kill me 1 shot to head and i get mad, but then i just stan back and say  carm down es onli gaem  and i am stay calm . i lern from my pro fren who is silver 4 in-game that if i get mad i am fail and alway die. die is not good. anyway i make it to silver 2 when i get good and that means i am not lowest rank !! i am going to try get silver 3 maybe but my fren in silver 4 is always gooder than me. i like game and i rate it 10 out 10",3
"a more complete and polished version of the classic 1.6, cs:go does not disappoint. once you start, there is no looking back. you are hooked for life. this is a must have game in your collection.",2
"awesome!!!!!!!!! the best game i played for a while now!!!!",2
"when it comes down to it, its just plain fun. sure it might incite some rage a bit here and there, but it has become one of the few games that ill always come back to. if you like shooters and you see it on sale, id say its a must buy. the addition of gun skins is neat too.",1
">see a guy >shoot him >miss every shot >he turns around >kills me in one shot >exit cs:go 10/10",1
"totally recommend this game to all fps games lovers. it is just like the old classy cs but with a better recoil system, and many extra features, i personally mostly play it because its got a competitive mode(ranked). 9.5/10",1
"game is great and all but has too many cheaters which just ruins the gameplay and having to pay to play on a secure server is just a boner kill.",3
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",1

"its like cod but marginally less kids and more bombs really tho get it plos",2
"this game is so fun to play, i just got it today and i am allready hooked. this game os fun but only 2 flaws, you cannot zoom in on your scope, and i fell there should be more gamemodes without the dlc, not just 3",1
"its a really nice game, a lot of cool weapon skins, and other stuff. i highly recommend this game.",2
"everything about this game is awesome. except the official matchmaking. and its 64 tick servers. and the hit registration. and the community. and the anti cheat system. oh and its digital knives cost more than real ones... yet somehow i blew a thousand hours on it. i guess the chicken ai is half decent?",4
"good old game! after hours of game play, theres still something new everytime in the match between different teams and players! cheers and have fun in the game~!!",1
"this game is so fun especially if you play competitive with friends. the one downside is that if you want to get cool weapon skins you will need to spend money. do buy this though because its a great game.",2
"youve been visited by a rngesus of broken economy and overpriced terrible-looking skins. 3$ crates and stattrak knives will come to you but only if you post thank you, based csgo in this review.",2
"someone got mad at me because im a one star that top scored a ranked game",1
"definitely the best-playing and best-looking cs game in the series, in my opinion. worth the 15 quid so much. the extraeneous tf2-eceonomy crap theyve added in is a bit dissapointing, but its still a good game.",1
"play for enough time and youll get your money back from drops. 10/10",2
"best game in my library, will literally be the best thing you ever buy! 10/10",4
"10/10 would buy, best game ever. graphics epic and there is explosions and .... awsome. u meet all kinds of people. mostly 12 year olds but still, you might also find a 10 year old. they all do the same thing. scream in their mic or run and die. its great! and there is wepon skins and . you might get one every ten year... if you are lucky. and what you get is . its awsome. u know what 20/10 would buy. best game of life.",3
"i love this game , its probably the best game for me. its alot of fun when you play with your friends . i definetly recommend getting it , you wont be sorry!",2
"played for 4 hours, seemed like 4 minutes. 11/10, will use awp again.",2
"cs:go is a nice fps game, its very popular all around the world. its fun to play and have a competetive mode where pro teams can play against other teams. there are also tournaments around the world where you can earn money if you win.",1
"best counter strike ever! so fun to play with friends. this game is not like run & gun, you have to play it with tactics. i recommend to buy this game!",1

"pretty good fps. the competitive aspect is pretty good.",1
"if you want to become good rank like dmg or above. please make a second account. because if you play with your main with low ranks than your rank get killed. thaths all and to everyone who plays cs:go and is low rank or just a stupid monkey: go and play tetris or minecraft. update: well the community is really great (not) and yeah so to every noob: go and uninstall this game you dont deserve it to play this game. you deserve nothing.",4
"if you dont own this within a month of me having you added im removing you",1
"i love it. they say its as close to real life as possible.... it is!!!",3
"ive come a long way since i started playing this game, although i know theres still a long way for me to go. valve has done it again by making a game that feels good to be good at. i like very much the way item drops occur and i might one day end up getting back the money i spent to get in. thank you valve :)",1
"it may be fifteen dollars, but is a fantastic game for all who love strategic and fps games. it is short combat (5v5) and has weapons from awps (sniper rifle) to negevs (heavy fire machine gun) and more. it also comes with a different combination of grenades and pistols. the only downside is that people tend to get serious over nothing, but is still tons of fun. so if you want to buy it, then buy it, because it is definitly worth fifteen dollars. if you love any valve game or shooter game, than this is the game for you.",1
"this game is great. its fun to play. it has good graphics. it has a lot of maps. it has good community support and great support for the community (with its large variety of maps).",1
"the game is extremely fun. if you like the search and destroy kind of games, this is definately a game to play.",1
"really fun game. it has some quality of shooting real weapons like recoil, which makes the guns somewhat balanced and unspammable. fun once you get to the point that you know what your doing.",1
"would highly recommend to any fan of the competitive fps genre!",1
"after playing this for a couple of hours, i came to the conclusion that this game will suck the life out of you. i, being a silver i since forever, still strive to become a better player. even when 9 out of 10 times my teammates refuse/are unable to speak english. so basically, buy this game. support gaben by wasting your allowance on keys to get  skins and sell them for 1/10th of the key price. such is life in cs:go. 9/10 11/10 with rice",1
"unless you enjoy being banned for 7 days for having connection problems, or because your team is full of idiots who cant fathom, that if you dont use shift or crouch, then yes, everyone in the damn game will hear you running around like a bloody rhino, then i advise you not to get this game.",2
"this remake of the original fps game of all time makes me feel amazed",1

"knifes in real life $20 knifes in game $400 holy sh*t! 10/10",1
"huge learning curve from the run n gun cod/battlefield titles i grew up with. once you break the habit of relying on ads and spraying everywhere, this can be a great game. when you do finally get the hang of it (13 hours in for me) there is a very rewarding feeling you get when actually doing good for a few rounds. definitely recommend this game.",3
"great way to lose all confidence you had in yourself and the confidence in your team, whilst being called a noob in more languages then you will understand, and be laughed at because you still run default skins. 10/10 would recommend to family and friends",4
"amazing game fun competive ranked win items just for playing unlock the skins such a great fps game worth every dollar i spent on this game",2
"matchmaking didnt teach me how to make matches my family starved when we went camping 3.5/10",1
"im not usually play cs games, but in this game i find it fun and enyoyable, i recommend this game, specially when its on sale!",5
"after almost 4 hours of playing i allready think this game is helemaal top",1

"counter-strike: global offensive is a good first-person multiplayer shooter, with a more arcade-style gameplay. the graphics are good, though the textures are pixelated at times. it is extremely competitive and very addicting. edit: pixelated textures due to settings. 8/10 edit new score : 9/10",2

"well you get to shoot stuff and they die and you win. sometimes - you mainly lose to be honest. ignore this",1
"at first i was cynical and hesitant to accept this as the successor to cs:s, as it only appeared to be better graphically. but im very glad i gave it a chance. cs:go feels like more of a modern shooter; think battlefield or cod, but done purely in a cs-oriented way: an improvement of cs:s. the weapons feel more versatile and there are less worthless weapons like there were before, in source there were really only 5 or so acceptable guns but in go, i find myself picking up many different weapons for different situations. the new maps are a welcome, i always thought the original lineup was rather limited (note: there are a few maps from cs:s that did not make it into cs:go, however, they are not really missed). a great fps experience, especially with friends. killing each other brings us closer together, no?",1
"*just gets unbanned after 7 days* *joins game* *four russians kick you* another 7 days of being banned.",2
"one of the best games ive played in a while. the graphics can be adjusted to be beautiful, the concept of the economy of the gun skins is great, theres no aim down sights so you need to actually learn spray patterns and use tactical plans. although this game is quite old, its always being updated which keeps it fresh and exciting. especially with the black friday deal coming up, i highly suggest you get this game.",1
"fantastic game, very hard though, but worth it if you are willing to put the work in.",3

"a bit of a mixed review- its a great game no doubt! if your already ranked in competitive! if your new to the game beware of the 2 win 24 hour cooldown, until you get 10 wins. & the in general cooldown system is a bit off. other than those this is a great game!",3

"buy skins . show off skins. brag about having beastly skins. cs go in a nut shell. 100/10",3
"honostly csgo, was the first game ive ever had in steam and i tend to keep it that way. counter strike isnt just about shooting people and winning its more to it. counter strike is a game where you can work as a team to take out the enemy oponents with challanging tasks. i know atleast one person would be reading this and if you are, go ahead and buy csgo.",5

"as a level 9 golden tier triple eagle triadic support rper, i must say that this game is groundbreaking. pros- supreme gunplay : as a former hired gun for elite operations and special operations, i know what a real gun feels like. that kick, weight, and satisfying click as the sliding thing hits the back of the gun. all these are down to a tee with this supreme work of art. graphics: the look is so realistic that i sometimes shoot people in real life thinking im still on my sweet home pc. this is the apex of 21st century gaming. sound: the screams, the lingo, and the surround sound make me smile every time i noscope a scrub with my deagle. cons- unrealistic livestock: the chickens would not survive in such an arid climate.",1

"its a game that takes a lot of time and effort to become the best with any help with the past cs games, csgo has improved and enhance the level of quality and gameplay so much that it makes you go  what about half - life 3.. in which gabe will reply  i cant count to three knowingly as he said three, anyways the game includes guns with camos called skins by 7 year olds even though there is no animal or human skin on the fire arm itself, weirdos, with these skins user often do business with each other i order to get a certain gun similar to team fortress 2 but with the added bonus of that your skins help you kill the enemies, thanks a lot hats. not only that csgo also has a competitive mode where hackers and people who dont go outside all to much, go in and err rekt face but if you manage to avoid them and win enough games, this will allow you to rank up. yes! rank up so you feel much better pulling that trigger overall 69/10 would play all day",1

"a much-refined first person shooter which recieves frequent balancing updates. while easier to get into than other competitive games (such as dota 2), the community can still be harsh if you underperform in the competitive mode (which comes with a decent, but not-yet-perfect ranking system). it features a few game modes appealing to all skill levels, and custom made privately run servers as well as officially run valve servers. all in all, i have very much enjoyed my time playing the game, and definitely got my moneys worth preordering it. as an added bonus, it features a very active community market, where you can sell and buy weapon skins and stickers. if you play your cards right, you can easily make back the money you spent on this game (especially if you buy it during a sale) in steam wallet funds.",2

"i dont know why am i still playing this game but anyway; dont play the freaking game if you have an angry personality because you will probabably break your keyboard because of the awper rats, sg553 / augs , p90s and hackers crawling around. oh by the way the people you call  friends  can throw you out just because you lost a few games together, and the cause of the lost will probably going to be the reasons i gave.. except this situations its actually a good game.",4

"counter strike: global offensive, or cs:go, is a fast paced shooter. most guns do not have a zoom feature so it isnt like call of duty if that is what you are wondering. you have to have a base understading in order to get really good. now that doesnt mean the game is not fun. there are many game mods for all types of players. they range from rescue the hostage, to plant the bomb, to your basic team deathmatch. there is also a competitive playlist if you are into that hardcore stuff as well. most of the maps are really well made and dont get old, if you do happen to get old of the standard maps then just buy the $3 map pack, or make a friend that has it since you can just join his lobby and play with em, that gives you this cool badge. this is a great game if you want something you can jump in and have fun.",3

"well, as a 7years css gamergirl, i can say: css is much easier to play. there are some weapons you can easily use, but some like m249, which was much easier in css (non-stop-fire you can kill more than you think :d), is very difficult. i hate the stupid request (vanguard), because its senseless. however. its still a nice game!",2

"counter-strike: global offensive is definitely a step in the right direction. all the people who played the older cs games will feel right at home with all the classic maps. however, everyone, no matter if its a new player or veteran, will have to get used to new things like recoil patterns, movement, etc. so everyone has an equal chance of winning, depending on how much theyve played and gotten use to the game, of course. cs:go combines tactics with shooting skills so well that it is one of the best well-ballanced and competitive shooters out there.",1
"cs:go is amazing! it took me a while until i got used to the weapon feeling and recoil, but when i got used to it, i was literally addicted to this game! i played it every night with my friends, trying to rank up in competetive or just having some fun conversations and troll around in casual. the only thing they should change is the price for the keys.... it started with 1,79  and after months the price slowly raised to 1,99 . all i can say is that cs:go is definitely worth its money.",3

"its official i am hooked. burned over 5 hours straight playing this game after purchase. i was a little hesitant in getting it and asked a few steam friends about it and they said it was very good. i like the new graphical updates to source, it looks great and runs smooth. sound and music are well done also. i like the stat and achievement tracking feature it has. i also like the fact that it has bot support for when i do not feel like dealing with whiny 10 year old punk kids. i enjoyed checking the new maps and gameplay options out, they are a lot of fun & challenging. cs:go is a great addition to the franchise. i highly recommend picking this up for the low price tag it is being offered for. i look forward to all the new content that valve has in store for cs:go as well. that is the great thing about cs is its mod support and added content that unlike battlefield and cod you seem to have to pay for or its no as user friendly for mods. recommended",1

"currently the best competitive fps indeed ! it is difficult to take in hand the game at the beginning, but with some practice, you should get the mechanics of the game. the strong point is that valve publishes updates regularly but also brings a support for the esport with esport cases, team sticker or event cashprize (esl one, dreamhack). valve is also close to the community and also helps map maker with the operation/season pass like operation breakout or operation phoenix, so you can play community map in competitive mode ! the weak point imo, is the community, youre a noob, ou youre a cheater. furthermore, there are many cheater when the game is cheap on steam, but these low prices are usually followed by many vac ban... this game does not look like other games as the call of duty saga (this game is for child and noob) and they want to make money, cs:go is a real competitive game which knows how to evolve and which knows how to listen to his community pro and casual community ! gl & hf ! thanks volvo :d",5
"cons - terrible community people complaing about weapons in game , if you use some weapons you will be cursed and called noob competitive bans - i got banned (30 minutes) because i kicked too many people (even if you didnt call the vote, only voted yes) even if you kick hackers, griefers or afkers several people play competitive and leave if they are losing games like 3 x 0 50% of the servers play only dust 2 people are very rude recoil is stupid and havent changed since cs 1.6 pros - weapon and boxes will drop and earn you steam wallet income trough market funny with friends",1

"easy game to play and to understand an it is sooo cooool! :)",1

"from all the counter-strike series, cs:go is yet the best! wonderful graphics and amazing new guns! #swag4life",2
"cs:go is blast to play. as a former 1.6 player, go gets most of the elements that made both 1.6 and source so successful while still bringing counter-strike forward into the present day. although i wish there was more focus on releasing more community maps for permanent competitive play as well as bridging the gap between valve sanctioned map releases and their competitive counterparts, it seems like the development team is moving the right direction. they do a good job of listening to the communitys needs and updates are released weekly.",2
"very fun and very competetive first person shooter. i really enjoy competetive mode and arms race.",1
"csgo is fun because u kill people lol and when u get ninja defuses and aces u make people mad kappa",1
"i recommend this game me and my friends play it everyday its a good use my time left over before i sleep xd",4
"the gameplay itself is fantastic, but the competetive penalties are too much. i was kicked twice within 24 hours-- once because i had to go, and the second time because i couldnt work my mouse-- and now i have a 7 day suspension. i understand about people joining and quitting games way too often, but there are people with real obligations and actual technical malfunctions. change the way people are penalized and i give this game a 9/10",1
"the only problem with this game is the community. it is full of s. its even worse than dota 2. valve doesnt seem to care enough to try to fix this huge problem though.",1

"being an experianced cs player in the past i found this game fun but frustrating. i played 1.6 allot and really found that the combat felt static and convuluted. it turns out i was wrong, it was just a different playstyle. would recommend.",2
"oh, counter strike the fps that wont  you over with prems, and is actually responsive. im actually having more fun in this than the years of playing 1.5~6, source, and the ranked compettitive matchmaking is neat whenever your in the mood for a serious game with communication. community servers arnt as fun as cs:s though :c also, you can milk steam money from the marketplace if you do it right.",2

"do not buy this game. the game itself could be really fun and is probably one of the best shooters ever made. but the amount of cheaters in this game is just not acceptable anymore and valve is doing absolutely nothing to stop it. i absolutely cannot recommend to buy this game. at the moment there is a cheater in every single competetive match and im not exaggarating. this game is not fun to play anymore.",4
"a great mp game. it requires alot of skill and understanding of the guns and when you are able to kill an opponent, you feel a great accomplishment in it. competitive solely relies on teamwork and communication, if that is your type of thing. this game if perfect for you.",1

"dont buy this game if you plan on seeing the sun again.",2
"great game, usually a one time fee of $15 but the past winter sale had it at $2.99/copy. valve does have some work to do on this game, while other games have balancing issues and a crappy player base, this game is not so much affected by that so much as it is affected by the subpar servers. about 95% uptime, but when they go down you get a penalty for leaving the match and get banned from competitive servers. this may happen multiple times in a row, and an undeserving player may find themselves left with much rage and a 7 day ban.",2

"i started playing this game and i got to say the amount of females i was getting doubled",2
"when i play this game i have fun somewhoat reliably",2
"this game is really a fantastic game! this game is unique due to the competative mode and the different types of skins available for your gun. and the funn with this game is offcourse the game itself but aswell as opening cases and earning new weapons to show of to your friends, and some skins can be really expensive and can get sold for quite alot of money, but other than that the game is fantastic with great graphics and nice controls and a standard fps shooter key layout",1
"very fun and competitive game that you can play alone or with friends. even though at times the game can be frustrating it is still very fun and well developed",2
"one of the classic fps-games brought to modern gaming! hundreds of hours well spent!",3

"who doesnt like counter-strike? thats a serious question! it was a bright, cold day in november, well i really dont remember the weather but it was nov. 8th when counter-strike first appeared as a retail purchase. over 13 years later, the series is still a success. counter strike: global offensive not only has an awesome subtitle but a nice community behind it. but ill get to that later. let me talk about how great this game is. simple, quick and realistic is what describes cs:go. it also looks great with the source engine, the game being the second using the engine. it blends the classic with the new. your favorite maps from previous games are back and prettier than ever. the community behind this mulltiplayer game is superb. valve truly knows how to work in-hand with their fans. this game comes equipped with steam workshop, where the people create items and customizations for others to enjoy. to close up, i must say get this game. its only 15 bucks and its totally worth it.",1
"great game i play it everyday. its not like cod were u run around. this game u use strategy and and team work. without them to you are not going to win. this game is not a 1 man team game",4
"awesome graphics, awesome gameplay, new weapons, new gamemodes. in other words its an awesome game.",1
"if youre missing out on cs:go, youre missing out on a lot. the counter-strike series has always been an enjoyable expirience, but with global offense the fanbase and the series have improved tremendously. i may be no casual gamer, but over 300 hours is still a lot for me, considering i have a rather busy schedule on my hands. cs:go has exceptional graphics, good sound quality, an excellent player-to-developer setup, and since i upgraded my computer i have found very little issues with this new installment. very competetive, however, and for anyone who is new to the game i recommend spending many hours into bots before you go online. bots can be more predictable, and more importantly if you miss a shot your team isnt going to scream at you. there are also some excellent people out there like thewarowl who can really help newbies learn the basics of the game and then that little bit extra. the only thing i really have to say besides that is that every dollar ive thrown at cs:go on the market ive wasted: never un box",1
"an amazing addition to the cs series, whith the series best graphics--whilst fast and easy on ram/gpu systems, interface, and gameplay that is uncomparable to any of the other games. as the gameplay might be closer--it is a fps--it still keeps the feel and play of cs with an additional amount of new feautres and cleaner hud. the menu and interfaces in the game unique and works well and is quik and easy to get used to, without distracting or steering away from older/modern interfaces. as for the new official gamemodes for the game adds more hours and fun to the game versus source or any of the others.",3
"the superior fps ! very tactical and endless playtime.",2
"made me buy useless skins so i could brag to all the cool kids and do well in competitive. then someone hurt my feelings by saying they ed my mother. i teamkilled him and got banned for a week, but at least i showed him how awesome i was with my stickered awp. when i finally made it to silver 2 i was so happy that i came sween cream right into my whitie-tighties, best moment of my life.",1

"a bit challenging than past counter-strike games but the game has not changed. although, a lot of people are now getting away with hacks. hopefully this game wont turn into cs 1.6 where you cant find a game without a hacker.",3
"very entertaining game, with lots of fast-paced action and sometimes terrifying suspense. has a pretty good community depending on the game-modes that you play and competitive, although time-consuming, is very good to show off your skills and best your mates! just like tf2, cs:go has its own trading market with things such as souvenirs, stat-tracked items ect. if youre into a game that can be competitive at times and chill the next, then definitely make sure to chuck it onto your wishlist for christmas! tl:dr you can shoot stuff and make money. 8.5/10.",2
"simple to learn, difficult to master. also, you can name your guns after anime characters and be a mega weeb :d ...what am i doing with my life? :/",4
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",1
"this is a very good game. challenging, but its entertaining. its a bit annoying when it comes to going competitive mode since you have to deal with random people that you have never met and very hard to co-operate. very suggested to create a team and all within your team to improve on aiming, recoil, and spray pattern techniques. anyways, its very good when it comes to muscle memories etc. because of this game. ive managed to not break a glass on the floor because of my quick reaction. anyways, i recommend this to people who enjoys fps games!",2

"so awesome i have played like an hour and its ing awesome!",3
"i recommend this game because its really fun to play with friends, but when you have no friends then you are ing alone and find russians on this 64 tickrate valve servers which are pretty annoying when you shoot enemys head from 2 meters and it says you hit him 26hp in 3 hits gg valve has no money to change the servers to 128 tick but anyways is fu to play, i prefer source but there are no mix servers left. 6/9",2
"one of the best games in the counterstrike series!",2
"this game is so fun that you will put down all the other ones you play and star playing this one for a really long time. the maps are well evened for both teams(but there will be those maps that arnt somethimes) play with fun players which will most have mic to. guns are always fixed if to strong or to weak so they get evened out eventually. this game is my favourite online game now. 10/9 (      )",2
"been loving cs:go... never played cs or anything before it. love that all of the wepons are unlocked and that there is no pay to win its all straight up skill. live long enough to be called a hacker, die fast enough to be called a newb.",2

"most realistic and strategic gun game i have ever played.",1
"one of the best pc games of all time in my opinion a must play, if you have the time to invest into this game it can be alot of fun",2

"a really good game to get into if you have the time....",1

"great for the family, affordable, outstanding service!",2
"do you enjoy shooting heads? spanish speaking teammates? hours and hours of frustration and 64 tick servers? if so buy this game",3
"the best fps game i have ever played. i played cod and battlefield before discovering this game, and let me tell you, i have never been so engrossed in a video game in my life. i would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of fps games or something just discovering the genre.",3
"i have to do this review for a badge... dont judge me.",2
"a fun game that is meant for people who like shooting and strategy. this is more fun to play with friends , rather than alone, but can also be played that way. it requires high reflexes and precision , aswell as prediction and team play. multiple game modes make it fun, but i feel like the number of official maps could be bigger. the competative addition is realy good, as it allows you to match aginst your level of opponents and display your level of skill. there isnt a lot of weapons, but the current amount is ok. for each weapon you have to learn how to play with it (the recoil, bullets and other factors) so it takes time to master each one. the skin system is very fun and if you have some money in your pocket, you can open some crates and get cool skins to show off to your friends. overall this game is pretty fun and defintaly worth your money, if you like these kinds of games.",1
"so much time was spent. so worth. highly recommend!",3
"this game is similar to a vending machine that eats your dollar and gives you nothing. goty 10/10",1
"no lost my girlfriend lost my life lost my life i never had",1
"i cannot more highly recogmend this game!!!! get it now!! it is cheeper than codm and bf combined (as of wrighting this) and has dlc that you dont have to buy because it becomes free after awhile!!! get it!!!!!",1

"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",4
"probably the most fun game that i have ever played. there are not a lot of games like this that require skill other then having the best weopons that expeirenced players have in games. in this case everyone has the same thing.",1
"one of the best all time counter strike experience. alot harder than cs:s, but worth every cent. if you like playing cs this game will blow your mind away.",1
"great game! learning the game doesnt take very long and its very fun. i recomend this game to any experienced fps-player.",1

"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",1
"pretty good game, you can have spray-painted guns, and stickers, the maps are really good, nuke is my favorite map, you cant respond on some of the game modes, its like the t.v show the deadliest warrior, this game deservers a 10/10, good job valve.",1

"pros: -you get to defuse the bomb with your mind 5 meters away -the bomb code is always the same -you get a mushroom hat if you have a rank -you get to buy keys but you find out you bought the wrong one -no no-cross map no scopes -no cross map knives -you can kill people with decoy grenades cons: -valve+hats=weapon skins=cases=keys=$2.49/key=half life 3 confirmed.",2
"great game: fast paced, skills and a competive mode with skills ranks makes it one the best, if not the best, fps multiplayer game.",2
"counter-strike: global offensive is a really good fps game, i love it.",1
"its a must buy game if u like fps gaming gr8 graphics,good tactics & nice gameplay ! cs main problem was just the graphics now cs:go completed that problem to! its just amazing game must play ! the game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, match making is great when you are playing with friends.",1
"i like this game and i highly recommend it to others because im cool like that.",2
"today i killed people, and then i got money for it. then i got better weapons to kill them with again. it was fun untill i got killed and someone stole my weapon. then i got angry at my friends because they refused to give me a new weapon. so i shot them, and then i got voted out of the match. this game is fun.",1
"do not buy this horse game. you will get mad at them ing kids.",1
"fast, strategic, and punishing just like the original. now with chickens!",2
"just remove the competitive ban system and the game would be better without it",3
"$15 well spent. if you havent played cs 1.6 or anything prior, you need the game. if you have played the old <1.6, you really need the game. if you have not played counter strike, this game is slightly more noob-friendly, as it has a variety of game modes. throw in a beautiful achievement system, and trading cards, click buy.",1
"you mightnt think much of this game because its a realistic shooter, but it is honestly a whole lot of fun. you can play counter-strike to chill out or you can team up and strategise. if youre worried about the playerbase, they are actually quite laid back. its brtual at times, but when you play well, you really feel it. give it a shot!",4
"cs:go is a competitive and fps game based off its past generation of games. just buy it. its not pay to win and its worth as much as dinner at outback steakhouse. dont eat and youve got cs:go. 10/10 would rate again",1
"i really like this game, but the hit reg really breaks the game for me. you can be shooting someone with an ak and see bullet holes appearing in the wall just behind them and blood splattering all over, your first thought is yeah this guy has no chance, but all of a sudden you drop dead from a really lucky headshot and when the box pops up and shows you how much damage you did, see you hit him zero times, even though you gave the wall behind him a nice new coating of his blood.",2
"i remember like it was yesterday, i playing the first counter strike in 2000. since then, becomes one of the games i played the most in my life! versions like 1.5 and 1.6 are perfect for me! over time it seemed that valve is lost! until i got the surprise launch of the global ofenssive. counter strike go, legend of the fps back! this game is amazing!",4
"quick cs go review: pros- furious gunplay, well balanced maps, lots of specialized weapons intense competitive play, lots of skins to collect, new game modes to choose from cons- very few vanilla maps, must pay for extra map packs steep learning curve in conclusion, this game is very enjoyable once you master most of the weapons and learn to be an effective team player. ps. if you dont have a mic dont think about playing competitive, microphones are a must for any serious gamer!",2
"awesome game. started off as a silver 4 now a dmg.",2
"best competitive fps i have played to date. very addictive. 11/10",5
"spent a lot of time playing this game, found lots of friends to play and rage with.",1
"matchmaking sucks. people quit way to often. never put with a full english speaking team. always got someone crying for a weapon drop. always one  chasing chickens. the community is filled with 8 year old cod fanboys. even if your the best, your a noob. end up spending way to much money on skins that dont mater. so yeah, 15/10 best game i ever played.",2

">see a guy >shoot him >miss every shot >he turns around >kills me in one shot >exit cs:go 10/10",1
"hell yeah, this is an awesome game, take cae you may get adicted :d",2
"as addictive as cs has always been, with matchmaking reducing the need for pickup/organisational 5on5 clan matches outside of sponsored leagues. any game that offers both matchmaking and dedicated servers is a winner in my book. this game encourages both community play and competitive, which is something many games fail to achieve in modern gaming. this game has built on its predecessors for the better and i cannot recommend it enough.",4
"awsome game... u have to choices to do.. 1) die fast and get called a noob 2) play hard until they say u are a hacker if u didnt like those choices then dont play this game but u are the loser for not playing i give this game no less than a 9/10",2

"this game....is far and away the best multiplayer fps game i have ever played, it would take so long to talk about how good it is that ill just give it a 15/10. you really do need some skill to play it though, unlike cod and other similar games.",2
"amazing fps game, requires skill and teamwork. 10/10",2

">see a guy >shoot him >miss every shot >he turns around >kills me in one shot >exit cs:go 10/10",1
"so if you plan to buy this game be prepared because this is not cod or battlefield where you can spray guns and require little to no knowledge about the maps or equipment, weapons etc and go good regardless. because in cs:go if you turn a corner be prepared for pure  because you can get 1 shot killed by almost any gun if your hit in the head, oh! and by the way anyone who plans to join the 720 double yy no scopes clans such as faze or optic your gonna be right at home with this game because be prepared the.... awp! #jk youll get demolished if you expect to bring your quickscope skills to cs because you will most likely get kicked or banned form any server because everyone will hate you and probably want you to die.... so yeah! welcome to world of counter strike! 11/10-awp of the year!",3
"cs:go is a really good game. not made for a casual gamer.",3
"this game is a nice tactical shooter. meta-game is really big. it takes a long time to get into if youve never played a cs type game before, but its pretty fun once you get to the ~30 hour mark and start playing competetive. you have to be pretty rich to afford this game in the long run though because of all the broken keyboards when playing matchmaking with randoms, and opening cases will drain your paypal account faster than you can say stattrak butterfly knife | fade.",4
"its a little bit weird how the counter terrorists have to buy weapons and gear for their own money and how the terrorists have this universal timer on their bomb with the same code all the time.",4
"i love how tactical this game is and it is unlike any other fps out there.",2
"this game is too good. ing love it, unfortunately the community is .",4
"well this game has anything you can imagine in a shooting game.you can trade items , many gamemodes , different maps , its pretty much what a gamer wants from a shooting game. 10/10 gayban (gaben <3333) (no homo)",1
"if you want a game where countless seagulls bite and sting your face, then this is the one for you. sometimes, it just gets out of hand and there are so many seagulls that even the best computer lags. i bought this game way back in 1992, when the beta was first out. this game started out as a mod for grand theft auto:chinatown wars, but blizzard entertainment launched it as a full on game for steam. this game has several guns to pick from. the infamous cannon, the slug-mug-tug, and few others. if you are lucky, there are crate drops that occur once a month and you can buy a key from the in-game store with 5,000 microsoft points. the worst possible unbox you can get is a knife, so if you get a knife, then put it on the market for $0.03. thats what i sure did.",1
"if you like fps games you will love this its the most fun fps game ive played yet",1
"russian: ehhh why are you so butt hurt my friend? me: your mums butt hurt because my mushroom tips too fat 10/10 would be butt hurt again",2
"#1 tactical fps of all time. is what you are told about this game, and within a hour of playing it, youll say the same. epic.",3
"great game. you find yourself buying more skins than games on steam. this game has a huge learning curve. the game can make you kind of mad at some points but there are moments where nobody cares and the game is just a 5v5 party. overall this is a great game and i recommend this to anyone.",2
"great for inspecting guns while getting shot in the head. best gun simulator out there.",1
"one of the best fps game and great quality of the game. but the bad sides is cs go is becoming more like cod. more ragers, raqequitters, afkers and so on..",1
"great competitive game a lot of fun alone and with friends. you can enjoy yourself for 1 or 2 matches or really play it all day depending on the mood your in. but still its really worth the money 14 euro isnt alot for a game this good. the textures arent stunning but good enough for a game focused on the gameplay. this alos means it can run on almost any pc. if you like competitive play this is the game for you. i love it :d",2
"this game is easy too learn and very fun to play, i recommend it for big groups of friends looking for their next big game too play!",2
"a great game ! the decoy grenade ,the incendiary and the different varieties of custom made guns has made this game yet another addictive sequel to cs 1.6 !",1
"this game is ing amazing, you have to have a great amount of skill to play this game. its a bit hard at first but youll get better, trust me. i did, now its just really fun. :p",2
"amazing game yet can be annoying with all of the damn russians!",3
"best chicken killing simulator of the century. 10/10",1
"fun game especially for the money, if you buy it half off definitely worth the price. skins add a fun aspect to the game, you get a couple drops weekly so you can buy stuff just from playing. a couple issues with the game that take getting used too.",4
"its fun, its the counter-strike we all know and love, just reskinned with some new weapon models/maps/game modes and a few new surprises. its not meant to replace cs:s or 1.6, its aimed for the newbies and the casual crowd, but it can sustain the hardcore as well. tl:dr: same game, different box, worth more than $15, go get it.",1
"nothing more satisfying than killing sloots with an awp.",1
"ive not only spent too much money but too much time on this. 10/10 would recomend again",2
"cs: go stands as a glowing reminder that quality game design is rewarded in longvity and variety. valve has not only updated the eshooter but has completely outclassed its contemporaries. this is counter-strike, whatever the format you choose to play it on, and there isnt a higher recommendation than that.",1
"teh best game everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!",1
"this is a great game, but it takes a lot of skill. if you dont have the patience to climb up this games steep learning curve, i would suggest not buying. otherwise, it is worth the price completely.",4
"first 5 minutes of this game made me go back 8 years in the past and put a huge smile on my face :) feels like all of the ,,good stuff,, in cs 1.6 made it into this game.im just full of joy for getting it and you should too :d",1
"i found this game very well done, apart from the weapon skins economy, the game is well balanced and definitely a game worth spending your money on.",1
"the only game where you greatly value what your gun looks like instead of how good you are using it.",1
"one of the best fps that ive played, i recommend it.",1
"its good when servers dont crap out. its also good when you dont go up against smurfs. its also good when you dont run into hackers. its also good when your teammates arent bad. its also good when the other team doesnt stack up on autos. ye its good tho",1
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",1
"very nice game but community should be better, less hackers aswell please.",4
"very addictive and fun , if you play with the right team",1

"cs:go is an excellent game with various weapons to choose from and modes to play. it is a fast paced fps that can be played single or multi player. i personally like cs:go because it is easy to follow and tons of fun. extremely recommended for anyone who like fps. there are few glitches in the game but overall, fantastic game. :)",2
"the good points: cs:go isnt reinventing the wheel of first person shooters. if youve played any iteration of counter-strike over the years, youll find most of the content very familiar. that said, go adds enough to keep it interesting. all of the weapons feel unique and the variety of gameplay modes will mean endless hours of entertainment. the bad points: ive been playing video games for a long time and the cs:go community might be the worst ive ever dealt with. in addition to the run-of-the-mill trash talk, you can expect to be inundated with anti-semitic, racist, and/or homophobic slurs (ive heard some people use all three at a time to insult other players). i dont think ive ever heard someone say something insightful on the mic in all of the matches ive played. your best bet is to simply mute as many players as possible. all in all, a great game as long as you ignore what everyone says during a match.",1

"as a person who was not into the previous cs sequels, i must say this is a really good game the competetive mode is overwhelming at first but once you learn the basics its a good adrenaline pumping game. and also if youre lucky kinfes in this game sell for ridiculous amounts.",1
"this game will bring you alot of fun and hours played, ive played the first counterstrike 7 years ago. ive been a counter-strike fan since i first tried it out. ive got a total of 4000 hours in total of all the counter-strike games combined over my 7 years of service. this game is alot of fun and the operations are really great! if you feel like you dont hit, either become a better player by training your aim and reaction, or you could switch from valves standard 64 tick (64 updates per second) to a paid 128 tick server (costs if youre gonna do it the pro way, some free servers for it in the server browser). this game is very cheap and on some sales (which is common), it can cost around 3. thats the price you sell one or two cases for, which drops very common! this game is updated and maintained alot. this is a very good game and i support it to 100%.",2
"counter strike. the best way to waste 75% of your life. in 2000 counterstrike openned up you played and played and played. until you were comepletly sick of it! then you swore of of it forever! until counterstrike source came and then you played until you were ready to die! but then counter strike zero came out and you revisted all of the old glitches that made you want to hang yourself. finally when counter strike global offensive came out you played so long that your still playing. like dis if yah cry evvvwheey thime. :{ still one of the best games on steam worth the money and wasted relationships:)",1

"great game, especially played with friends. lots of fun to either screw around and just have fun, or try hard to get a high rank in competitive matchmaking. either way this game brings almost never-ending gameplay with the assortment of strategies and weapons, for only 15 dollars, i think everyone should give it a shot (terrible pun).",1

"all valve idid is create a game that generates profit. css was good, but this is just valve making the least used weapon (knife) into a multi-thousand dollar profit. also, vac and overwatch are not top-notch. they easily could. it only catches rough portion of the actual hackers to make it feel like a hackable game. once people feel that, they hack. many are banned because they cannot closet hack properly. these people purchase more copies of the game. steam puts the game on sale 1 time a year. massive sales/profit. problem blizzard? (i am aware of the terrible jokes in this review but the content is all too true.) fun game 7/10. realistic-ish, good team balance, decent weapon variety/team variety, graphics, player base. go away valve.",1

"how to win a round : awp and about half a year later since i made this review i noticed that i said all you need is an awp, but it is much more complex than that. take the time to learn how to play the game, and you will be just fine in normal matchmaking. once you get good enough you should start playing esea, if you are willing to dedicate that much time and effort into cs:go.",4
"my full review will be mentioned now: counter strike global offensive is a tactical multiplayer focused fps. you cannot aim just like any other cs game. accuracy is key when trying to get those mlg headshots. one shot to the head can end it for you with most guns, so staying in a group is advised. so if you like team based shooters, which require a steep learing curving. definitly pick this game up now and enjoy for many hours to be lost!",3

"counter strike: global offensive is an absolutely essential multiplayer experience. the gameplay has been refined to near perfection. the gun play is unparalleled and the complexity of this games competitive mode is staggering given how simple the games premise is. throw on top all of this a compelling market place where people earn, buy, sell and trade unique skins, stickers, keys and the like and you have got a recipe for pure addiction. i give counter strike: global offensive my highest praises and i hope to see future iterations continue the level of dedication and quality that is present in this online delight.",1

"this is a really good game. there are many multiplayer modes you can play such as deathmatch, arms race, demolition, casual and compettive. deathmatch is alot of fun and can be played when you dont have much time but want to have some fun. arms race is a fast paced game. it can be alot of fun. compettive is alot of fun and i really like the way it work. you have to buy your wepons at the begining of the round. rounds go about 4 min i would say and there are 30 rounds in a game. the game looks really good and its also very cheap. i recommend this game to everyone.",2
"i have played 1.6 and source, but none of them are as good as this game. this game is more realistic, more teamplay is needed and the grapics is improved. its the best game in fps section in my opinion. i dont want to waste another second on this, i want to play it! a must buy!",3

"counter strike at its finest. tactical and dynamic gameplay. best development and support. loadout personalization that allow you to get into action with style. learning the basics is a school of hard knocks, but once youll get through, your satisfaction level will rise along with your skills. that feeling when youre notified about scoring five or more kills... in-game item drops, matchmaking, built-in statistics and e-sport multiplayer center have made this game dangerously addictive. besides satisfaction, one of the coolest things that encourage you to play more are item drops and market speculations related with item trading. depending on a rarity class you can actually earn money and buy yourself some games from wishlist of yours. cs:go frag and trade!",2
"the 2 years later edit: this game made me lose an awful lot of time, but most of it was well spent. originally i felt that the skins update would mess up the game. i still think that, but now i think that while i have some new games and dlcs bought from those skins. 10/10 would spend money again. original: its a good game, a worthy successor for the series. even so, valve screwed up a few updates ago, since the adding of the weapons skins, and the game is lagging hard when people shoot. also, the stickers from the dreamhack event are bugged or not showing at all if you have an amd gpu.... all these being said, the game is good, but they should fix the lag, seriously... i rock bf3 at ultra and this game lags on the lowest settings...",3

"best counter-strike game yet edit: so after a few more hours of playtime, this game is definitely an improvement of the previous counter-strike games. from the graphics to the maps (which includes maps from source and condition zero and possibly counter-strike) and the buy screen is now more in-depth and i die anyway, so if i try bomb defusals with bots, i jump into a bot and steal his weapon. another reason for recommending this game is that it has held really well since its first release in 2002. if youre buying a counter-strike game, i definitely recommend this one.",1
"cs:go is an excellent game with various weapons to choose from and modes to play. it is a fast paced fps that can be played single or multi player. i personally like cs:go because it is easy to follow and tons of fun. extremely recommended for anyone who like fps. there are few glitches in the game but overall, fantastic game. :)",2

"this game, unlike most fps games now, actually requires skill and coordination to win. you and your team have to work together to acheive a common objective in a series of fun maps that encourage both close and long range fire-fights. i would highly recommend this game to everyone who is willing to pay for it.",1
"very addictive game even though it requires a lot of patience and practice to fully adapt in this kind of surrounding. but if youve already experienced playing the early versions of counter-strike ill be a lot easier. tip: dont lose hope or lose your cool everytime you lose in a particular match. just play and practice and youll get better. im still a newb in this game and hoping that ill improved more. :)",1

"a pretty decent fps shooter game that lives up to the counter-strike series. comes in a variety of gamemodes instead of your usual defusehostage missions. be prepared to play on either de_dust2; or de_inferno if you were to play defuse missions. sure there are plenty of de_ maps. unfortunately the community will most likely pick the aforementioned two. brace yourself to be ridiculously killed by an awp in pointblank range which put shotguns to shame. waiters with awp at the end of every aisle. pelted till death by p90s like nothing. and lets not forget, death by the weapon that requires utmost expertise. the gay gun. the terrorist team would most likely be stacked. but hey! you get skins.

"counter strike: global offensive (otherwise known as cs:go) is the newest game in the counter strike series. since ive already done a review of counter strike: source, im just going to talk about the many gameplay changes that go introduces to the series. firstly, the guns all have more kick to them, making run-n-gun players hugely greivanced. the guns all feel authentic and sound amazing, but i personally dont enjoy using the snipers and i cant stand the heavy weapons (i.e. miniguns). the weight of each gun has been pretty drastically increased, leaving slower and more methodical gameplay in its path. if you remember cs:s, there a probably 2 things you noticed: 1. there were very few shotguns, and 2. there were only two grenade types. well, in go, there are now 5 types of shotgun, and 4 different types of grenades! i personally believe is the best game in the counter strike series, and its methodical gameplay makes for a difficult experience, for both newcomers, and seasoned veterans.",1

"i love this game. i was obsessed with competitive tf2 before i got this game, and when i bought it i transitioned into it quite well. the competitive nature of the community and intense gameplay are giant pluses to me. one problem i found though, if you get quite into the game and learn the gun mechanics by muscle memory, it is extremely difficult to play other shooters without pulling your gun down after a second, or jumping and crouching to shoot someone. i guess that would be good though, as it shows its uniqueness and memorability. game was definitely worth my $15.",1

"very good game and a very nice game if you are in to competitive fps games. would recommend to a friend.",1
"i like this game but i like cs:source better than this. but its whatever people want so if you want this game its not a bad game so get both cs:go and cs:source 9/10",1
"very impressive graphics ^^ exciting and tense gameplay both online or offline",3
"hard to learn, impossible to master. this statement perfectly describes the learning curve of the counter-strike series. this is no different with cs:go. the latest installment in the counter-strike series boasts a serious competitive multiplayer, with a somewhat relaxing yet challenging offline play with ai. it also features various gamemodes like arms race (gun game) and deathmatch. along with the actual game, there is also a huge emphasis on the community. with the toolsets given by valve, users are able to create weapon skins and entire maps for submission on the workshop. i have seen truly amazing, creative and brilliant ideas come from the workshop. pros: - great multiplayer - awesome community integration - fantastic customisation of settings - relaxing offline mode with bots cons: - hard to learn. even harder to master. worth the $15. must have on sale.",2
"i remember when i wanted to be a goat.... then i bought cs:go.",3
"the adaptation of the good ol counter strike to nowadays. with new weapons skins and maps!",1
"wow bioware comes at us again with another lame game, -strike: 360 agressive. i like how treyarch put 2 dudes on the cover (again) and this time theyre in position with the peepee in the butt. theres nothing new added to this sequel, i relly hate how its the same old grampa guns, wow nintendo, please put iron sights, red dot sight, and quickscopes pleaseeeee :(((. this game has 2 modes: casual mode and competitive, it sux tho, casual mode has losers that arent mlg and even competitive is too easy cause every1 else sux and im the best :) overall omg i hate this go play black ops 2, the shooter of the year 2012 :))))",1
"this game just awesome ! so huge variety of mods .. very fun with your friends :d",3

"best game of the year good community, fun to play with friends, one of the best and rising game",5
"not as good as its predecessor, but still well worth the money and still has that counter strike feeling. introducing the competitive game mode takes a lot of hassle out of the game. theres still a lot of hackers about though.",2

"if you love playing fps games then you should probably get this ;) 5 stars from me",2
"one of my favorite games, i play it every day. one of the only fps i like at the moment. its really fair, if you die its most likely your own fault and not by some cheap killstreak reward. love the competitive matchmaking. it also has dedicated servers with most of the mods from source. if you like cs it is a must buy. if you are not really good at shooters it can be fun to play arms race, deathmatch and other random custom gamemodes. can be really hard to get into though, but the game has ranks that will match you with opponents with the same skill level. if you put some time on it you will improve quickly :)",5
"for this price itd be crazy for you not to buy this game. one of the best shooters of all time and more skill oriented than call of duty. if you want to see more gain for your effort and time spent perfecting your skill this is the perfect game for you.",1

"im very new to the counter stike series and have for a long time now stayed away from it after playing a few round quite a few years ago and hating it. coming from a more traditional fps genre it takes a while to retrain yourself and break habits like strafing and spraying. casual gameplay is a bit of a crazy mess but fun to play. competitive is where it is at and can be alot of fun if you get a nice polite team that communicates well. playing with friends and partying together is highly recommended if you and your other friends are new to the game. i recommend this game as it is a challenge and an overall fun game with a good competitive side.",1
"the most balanced and competitive shooter out there right now, with one of the best dev teams behind it. cs go is everything i wanted 1.6 to be years ago, and nearly 500 hours in im not bored of it yet.",3

"its verry well made, and you will need some practice playing till then you will get distroyed in game.",2
"definitely a fun game to play but since the game has gone on sale many times and is very cheap from time to time, hackers have used this to their advantage and use hacks in the new matchmaking system",5

"this game is awesomeeeee. ive had this game in my steam library for a really long time, played it now and then. but just now realized how much gametime you can get out of this. you have casual mode, competative, you can play custom game modes, etc. this game is very fun with friends, and also by yourself. i rate it a walrus/potato. very good game. should buy.",2

"cs:go. the 3rd major installment in valves counter strike series. ive found myself playing it a lot lately. its a nice change from the normal ads, shoot, kill, respawn, wash rinse repeat that multiplayer fps games have become. it does have a difficult learning curve though. if you expect to login the first time and be global elite, youve got another thing coming. ive played around 150 hours now and i still find myself very low on the ranked spectrum. its an amazing game, and if youre like me and things like cosmetics appeal to you, this is perfect! i love going into a game and hearing people saying they like my skins. dont know why, i just always have. tl;dr csgo is another smashing success from valve software and i reccomend it to people who have enjoyed the past games, and want a new outlook on fps games.",1
"i recommend this to everyone who likes first-person shooting games",1
"awesome game, amazing graphic, perfect gameplay...",3
"a brilliant game, a definate must buy for pc gamers",2
"this is as close to 1.6 as you are going to get without actually playing 1.6. that is a good thing and the competitive play allows you to easily jump into a 5v5 scrimmage with players around your skill level without having to scroung up 4 of your friends and hit up irc. while it isnt and never will be 1.6 it is a step up from source and brings back a lot of fond memories.",1

"ive played this game for a total of 2 minutes and can say that is without a doubt the worst game i have ever licked in my life. this monstrosity is overall just an adventure about two ing gay dogs who walk around and are just a bunch of inappropriate people in general. this game is not for kids because the dogs sometimes dont even say their pleases and thank yous. what the heck valve i thought you were a family based company. man i ing hate this game so much this is a game about dogs.",1

"if you like killing everyone and poppin some heads this is for you!",3

"the entire counter-strike series has prided itself on strategic, competitive, and difficult gameplay. this game is the embodiment of that--highly reliant on teamwork, individual skill, and communication. anyone who has wanted to play something that makes them yearn for improvement should purchase this game. the skill cap is immense, and there are always new things to learn. valve (volvo?) constantly releases patches and updates for the game, and frequently introduces new mechanics to keep the players on their toes. you wont be disappointed.",2
"cs:go is a fast paced action game with many modes, many skins, many knives, and alot of competitive players trying to go for the top of the hill. back when i was involved in the beta, there were few players that i knew, but alot of great enhancments from 1.6 and source. it did take a while to get used to the new engine, but as i progressed into the game, i got used to the new hitboxes. the arms deal update - this update introduced new ways to customize your weapons with different items from either map packs, collections, or tournament events. trying to get the rarest can sometimes get easy or rare, cheap or expensive. knives are hard to get, but also are some of the covert rifles. why do i enjoy this game? i am able to play with many other players of similar skill and more of the updates are helping making this game alot better with the reddit community having a voice.",2

"being that i have only played this game for less then 50 hours and can already jump into the competetive gamemode and play with other people around the world to earn ranks is a great thing to have added to a game. i have played many first person shooters and this one by far caught my interest because in most fpss you can ads but in this game it was all about hip fire and controlling your spray, with the occasional weapons that can ads. i highly recomend this game to everyone that can afford the $15 price. if you cant wait for a sale! everything goes on sale eventually, and this is definetly worth the wait!",1

"cs:go is the latest game in the famous counter-strike series and contains a mix of many of the original features from counter-strike 1.6 as well as some features from counter-strike: source, all with newer graphics and a couple of new weapons, all balanced close to near perfection. one of the later patches also added collective skins for the weapons, which, while not too far from the system in team fortress 2, doesnt impact gameplay and is purely cosmetical. there has also been added an workshop for maps (so you can easily get custom maps) and skins (so you can submit your own). i can easily recommend this game and guarantee it will bring you many hours of good fun, provided you liked 1.6 or source.",2

"very fun and good game i will expect a lot from the next game in the counter-strike series",1
"decent game. i would suggest even for those who arent that keen to grab the game when it comes on sale ($3.75) as you can make your money back, just from selling items you get in game for free. this game is what is fuelling my game purchases from now on. besides from that, its a great fps, but is more then just a fps. it uses strategy, teamwork, and commitment, all of which have resulted in a (mostly) good community. its also has custom features, so you can choose your weapon skins, and can buy dlc packs that support community modders. and to finish it off, its got continued dev support, so it will (hopefully) only get better.",2

"this game is one of those games where the character you play as doesnt get any better, but it is one of those games where the player themselves get better. the learning curve on this game is amazing. there is no overpowered weapons although some may argue that the snipers and the pro90 are overpowered. let me put it this way. they arent! every gun has their specialty but they all have their weaknesses. the snipers and be easily neutralized with one smoke. the pro90 is terribad in longer ranges. the only weak point of this game is that the official matchmaking server are 64 ticks, which makes the game slightly unplayable but can be worked around by playing in third party server services.",5

"by far the best shooter-game on the market at the moment! it is not pay-to-win like other bad shooter-games.. but the skins are a must-have in that game tho so you will pay more than the 14 for the game because eazy skins eazy lyfe right?",2
"i think it is the best game ive ever played. no jokes",3
"an extremely fun-filled tactical shooter. this game is full of teamwork and strategy, and has so many levels of gameplay. practice in a fast-paced game of deathmatch, or a more relaxed battle of wits in a competitive match. it wont be long before you find yourself back on the community aim servers training your ever so important reflexes. this game is definatly a 10/10, and lives up to the reputations of the previous counter-strikes.",2

"cs will never get old, i suppose. this one is better than previous ones in all aspects: graphics, ui, game modes (gungame and deathmatch are now official game modes). also now there are hats in the form of weapon skins and stickers, as well as ubiquitous item crates.",1
"csgo, has indeed come a long way since beta/release. the game went from playing very much like cs:s, all the way to playing like 1.6 with cs:s aspects. the graphics and engine were updated handsomely and the community has their hands all over the customisations. valve listens to the community about weapon balance for the most part, and playing fair is never an issue! i normally dont play competetively when it comes to gaming, but im absolutely addicted to the good team work it requires to win rounds in csgo. another great thing about this game is, if you pay full price for csgo, youll have your money back in no time from selling any item-drops you get on the community market! absolutely a great game, and a must-have for any person who games on pc!",2
"cs:go what can i say about it other than it being one of the best fpss on the planet. with a community that is second to none being one of the funest games that i have played. either it being some simple casual or heated competitive. you can enjoy this game no matter what including the countless community maps. cs:go is a game that anyone can pick up play and have fun with it.",3

"gg ghood game, with less hackers would be better game",5
"as a player with huge heart for quake 3 arena i used to hate counter-strike without really trying to play it. i just saw that people really camp a lot there and something like running or strafing isnt a real option there.. but the the summer sales on steam hit me right into my head and i decided to give cs go a try. ive tried the cs 1.6 and source too but as it is now, ppl mostly play cs:go so i sticked to that. i spend quite a lot of time on this game, i dont think im bad.. guess some of my aim and call for fast thinking from quake was left in me :). conclusion: cs:go is a nice fps game, maybe too good graphics for me, cause sometimes its really hard to see the enemy or to determine if its a friend or an enemy :d.. anyway as long as its a team game i recommend playing it with friends, because random ppl not always know what teamplay does mean. have fun!",4
"great game. however it does have the worst community since the nazi party.",1
"very good team orriented game. much more fun to play with friends. great game would recommend",2
"this is an awesome game its lots of fun, if for sure a must have :)",2
"in case youre unfamiliar, counter-strike is an entirely multiplayer experience. you can play offline against ai bots, but these are still merely simulating what its like to play online, rather than really giving you a single-player game. the good news is that this is as good as online team-based shooters get. in the traditional game mode, there are two types of matches and two tiers of play. casual level is for newer players and removes aspects like friendly fire and the need to purchase armor and ancillary items each round (more on that in a second). ranked level is the original style of cs, with all the realism settings enabled, but it also features a comprehensive skill-based ranking system to try to balance teams and place good players with other good players.",1

"despite what youtube griefing videos implied to me, running around in gun game knifing people to demote them isnt nearly as easy as it looks, and that experience is all i wanted to get out of this game. this is just another case of me being  at a game and saying its bad because i never wanted to play it in the first place. hahaha its really good guys.",1

"isnt it the best game ever? when i switched from cs1.6, it didnt take me too long to adapt to cs:go and the game feels much more realistic. i like the recoil patterns, nade physics and.. weapon skins :d",3
"the game is alot of fun but almost only fun with friends on competitive, 50% of the time in comp with people you dont know its people with no mic or trolls, even people who leave the game as soon as it starts its a terrible feeling knowing youre gonna lose when someone is screaming metal in there mic standing still in spawn and you have a bot which is running around dying.

"took alot of getting used to at first, coming from 1.6 and cz and i missed css out, i hated the game at first. once i got used to it i loved it again just like the old ones, i only wish they would stop making it so cheap as cheats and smurfs are taking over the game",5
"i started playing during the beta. i went through a few lulls, but when i start playing again i cant help but keep playing. i also sold all my belonging for a knife skin, and even though i have to play at my local internet caf with a subpar pc, it was totally worth it. now all my opponents can see my level of skill through colors of my knife and when they see it, theyll know that synthetic god was their doom.",2
"the game is enjoyable, especially for shooter lovers, and for cs veterans. the new medal system is nice and keeps you plugged in beacuse you recieve achievements. pros: nice feeling and graphics. (since we do consider this is a 10 not 50 euro game) friendly community (mostly those in your team :p) you dont really get bored cons: cs was a stand alone pay...i don`t think that needed changing with different payble addons, but ofc those are only optional. overall 5 out of 5.",1
"although a lot of stupid, , antisocial and sometimes maybe cheating people run around in this game, and unfortunately you have to play with then sometimes... still it makes fun and wont let you go so easily for a long long time. so beware of its addiction factor. but maybe im one of the people described above. dont let the game get to you so hard, try to have fun and take it easy, thats what i should consider more often!",5
"initially i was very hesitant about this game; it seemed very risky to make so many fundamental changes to a formula that was barely changed through counter-strike: source and condition zero. however, seeing how much valve has listened and continues to listen the community, and how quickly they make changes in both the short and long term, it has completely restored my faith in the game. counter-strike: global offensive is incredibly fun and feature-rich, with plenty to do for both casual and competitive players. on top of this, there is also plenty of ways to promote and support esports, which is a much-needed and fundamental step in reinvigorating counter-strike in the competitive gaming scene. however, the most important thing with this game is that the community is incredibly nice and friendly - and with a game as difficult and intense as counter-strike, its extremely welcoming. good stuff!",2
"as a new player into the world of pc shooters and just pc games in general i find this game fun as . whether its playing with friends, by yourself, or opening up sticker capsels/weapon crates you will get a very unique experience. some shooters can feel clunky, easy, unoriginal, and boring...this does not though its challenging, unique, and above all fun. if youre looking to hop into the world of pc games/shooters i would highly recommend this game you. 9/10 basically game porn",1

"counter strike: global offensive, what a game. in my opinion money well worth spent! every penny you invest in this game is worth it. you must have the teamwork/coop skills as in battlefield.. and the small map skills as in call of duty.. yet there is multiple things we must have forgot! ~your own skill matchmaking ~skins!!!!! ~a wide variety of real weapons still being used today ~automatic communications ~team chat ~medals/achievments/badges to collect and earn ~a fancy skill level to show the world you are awesome ~you can make your own skins for a profit ~realistic gameplay such as weapon recoil, damage, and graphics this game also works very smoothly with just about every computer. 10/10 no if, ands, or buts. ~mr. j",1
"a tactical shooter that involves communication between players. communication in counter-strike: global offensive is very important and i strongly reccomend you this game if fristly you have the patience to learn and succeed. there are many mechanics that frist must be identified and learnt before you can play well. if you have the patience to hone these skills, and communicate freely this game might be for you.",2

"good game fun to play just like any other cs game. only issues are aweful steam support by admins that cant and wont do anything to help you as far as their  game crashing or kicking you from ther aweful 64tick servers, better off playing on 128tick esea or altpug clients for competetive. other then that it works good on good servers.",3

"this is a really good game, has some  but only in comps so yea. over all its a great game. 9/10",1
"i have not had a good ime with cs:go. it is another arcade like fps where you fight another team of soldiers in a small area, a concept which i see alot of and it is starting to get boring. i play alot of shooters like counter strike but for some reason i didnt like cs:go. i felt like the hit detedtion worked very poorly and people werent getting hit by my bullets even if i was directly behind them, with some gamemodes like deathmatch you respawn instantly after dying but because of the spawn system as bad as call of duty you die as soon as you start moving. cs:go also does something i hate in multiplayer videogames, it gives spawn invulnerability, that mixed with the bad spawns means that an enemy can spawn right behind you and kill you when you cant kill them because they are invincible. overall this is a poorly designed game and it brings frustration to me when i play it, i liked counter strike source but this game just feels like valve remaking call of duty.",1

"valve took what they did right with source, then added it to what they did brilliantly with 1.6 and slapped on some eye-candy. the result? nearly perfect. why nearly? because micro-transactions.",1

"this counter strike is a good fps and its price is very interesting and attractive too. we have a good balance between 1.6 and source. graphically, its good. you can play with a team in matchmaking competitive. the game is searching for you the enemies. and this is in function of your skills with the system of ranks. we have also some updates with new maps but you need to buy a pass to play on these maps. but if you have some friends, you can buy only one pass and after you need only to join your friend on the new maps. the price is 5usd or 4,5. but, you can easily get this money in selling the different weapons or crates that you can drop on the game.",5
"have you taken a look at the bad reviews for this game? quite amusing, theyre complaining because valve is trying to make money. > a company > trying to make money wtf? valve is literally ea. truth be told, this game is actually really great, you can play with your friends, or online. tf2 is used by valve as their main trading game, with little competitive play, and cs:go as their main competitive game, with a little trading. the trading in this game is done with weapon skins, and stattrak, which is like stranges in tf2. i strongly recommend this game, and if you find yourself getting rekt by guys who have been playing counter strike since 1.6 or source? just play against the bots on different difficulties, they arent like the cod bots, they actually shoot at you. 9/10 - please dont fix the aug, its great.",4
"ultimately a great tactical shooter. graphics are refined and are supported with awesome gameplay. multiple modes also exist in the game such as demolition, making the game possess more variety and a greater experience for the community. into the competitive gameplay, the game is fundamentally uses tactics supplied with fps action, differentiating it from other games. if youre into shooters and tactics, cs:go is definitely a game that you must pick up.",2

"counter-strike: global offensive (csgo), in a nutshell, is a fun fps with an awesome community. sure the gameplay is different than other fpss, but thats because valve listens to their customers. counter-strike has been around for a long time, and its gameplay has barely changed since it was released. games like call of duty and battlefield are constantly changing, so what happens is they loose their old fans, and gain new ones. counter-strike has always kept their gameplay remotely the same, so they keep their old players, and gain some new ones. for example, in call of duty you aim down your sights in order to be more accurate, in counter-strike, you crouch. yes i know aiming down your sights makes more sense, but valve doesnt care, because they know that their players dont care. i know this was a short review, and i focused more on gameplay than anything, but if you are into fpss, put this game on your wishlist and buy it when its on sale. you wont regret it, valve knows what theyre doing.",1

"do you like online fps? do you like guns?! do you like shooting people in the face?!?!?!?! if you do, this is the game for you. many many hours of shooting people in the face with a large variety of guns on a large variety of maps in a large variety of gamemodes awaits you. what the developers failed to include in the actual game is covered by the community maps and mods available. no complaints from me - this game was everything i expected and more.",1
"if you are a fan of previous counter-strike games, this is a no-brainer. for those who are new to counter-strike, this is a good place to start. this is a great game that requires a lot of skill to play, unless you use the auto sniper. everyone hates that guy. do not be that guy. ok be that guy. we will not actually hate you. we will just buy an auto sniper and snipe you back. dont start an auto war unless you can finish it. good game though!",4
"a really big step from cs 1,6 and people are still playing it a lot. the reason probably being that the game never gets old if you learn. this is an anti-game (the more you play at once the more addicted you get). it is an open world first person shooter that doesnt allow you to respawn when you die. the way its meant to be played - 5v5 you have to buy weapons and kill the enemy team or complete the objective. since this is an open world game you can go wherever you like and kill whoever you like (yes friendly fire is on). good game, could be better if the matchmaking would be more balanced.",1
"plagued with hackers. unplayable at the moment, please sort it valve.",1
"do not come into this game thinking you can hop on and kill people. that is my main reason not to buy it if you think thats what its about. this game requires alot of skill, patience and focus. even casual isnt fun unless you actually try. despite all of that, this game is really fun if you get a premade (group) to play competitive and work your way up the ranking system. there are alot of different community servers to mess around on if you want to, and deathmatch, gun game and demolition for a bit of fun. cs:go involves alot of camping, waiting and looking at the mini-map, and working as a team to win rounds, which are vital to your and your enemys economy and morale. the camping/ waiting part sounds bad, but it just adds to the drama. oh yeah. ez skins ez lyf ez!11!!!1!",2

"not bad, not bad at all, i prefer this to mating with possums thats for sure!",1
"feels very much like source should have been. like the original with some updated graphics and new weapons. positives: -very similar play to 1.6 in terms of recoil and play -new weapons -new skins -new maps -cheap @ under $15 my gripes: -no servers in my area so i cant play with less than 70ms in competitive. -only competitive allows for map selection, god i would love to take de_dust ii off of my map rotation list for dm warmup. -smurfs running in all ranks are potentially fun ruining and there is no option to surrender or leave unless someone else abandons and cops a 1hour or upto 1 week penalty. -buy menu sucks, way too big and clunky - honestly prefer the old cs 1.6 classic menu to this. overall totally worth the $14.99 and a definite pickup on steam sales, most of my gripes wont affect everyone but are just my personal view of what issues that the game has.",2

"counter-terrorists win. these words. they have lived with me for years now. when i first heard of this game i was all like new counter-strike, oh my good lord imagine how fun this will be. no more source! well i played it when it came out and.... i was very disappointed. bots, bots and more bots. this was a turn off. how am i to test my skill when these bots can just aim and fire? well i stopped, i didnt play for two years. and then this year my friends and i got back into it. (counter-source is my most played games by like 100 hours btw.) we were playing arms race and demolition and casual mode. arms race is stupid but so much fun. demolition is a fun quick version of defuse where you get new guns every time you kill someone. those stupid bots? well you can take over them if you die. very fun with friends, not great own your own but arms race is quite addicting and allows you to play on your own if you want. i like this game, source will always be my favourite shooter game, but this one is really good too.",1

"great game dont play if u dont have skill with competive fps",1
"as a cod player previously, this was not as much of a harsh slap in the face as expected. i find my gun skills are very sharp, and i am frequently asked if i have a second account. the only difficult thing coming from a fast-paced and careless call of duty experience is to focus, have patience, and actually think about winning. strategy is vastly more important in this game, and that is why tournaments are much more captivating than call of duty ones. if you are interested in something with teamwork-based elements and a competitive flair, then this game is perfect.",5

"overal rating: 10/10 good: +gameplay mechanics +graphics are quiet good +feels little bit like modern warfare 2 +camos +awesome maps +epic comebacks from 14-1 to 14-14 in no time if you communicate + blyat is not, but karma is a bich, so does kurvva bad: -servers are unstable sometimes -radiculous ban systems, if i get a ban its automatically 7 days if someone else gets its simple as that only 30 minutes - ultimate rage after that conclusion: this is an ultimate rage machine, if you ever played this you know what im talking about.",1
"this is a great game, although it is very difficult at first dont give up! when i first started playing i only played bots, thinking i was fairly good at the game, but i learned quickly when i went into a pub i got demolished, so i kept playing and playing pubs and everyone i watched they did things i never did (single tapping, side stepping, shift walking) and this taught me to practice these steps and now im fairly ok at the game, getting better every day.",1
"a nice game with the traditional counter-strike feeling, im not much of a reviewer, the aiming feels alot different compared to 1.6, cz or css. i really like the graphical design of the game and its really fun to play with friends, i like the addition of skins in this game purely for the reason of seeing the same guns all the time can get quite boring, and for some people that likes to collect items for games but never gotten into the more heavier item games such as tf2 or other things, it can be quite nice, though of course there are the fair share of fools who believe that skins makes you imediately better, it really doesnt. but id recommend the game, its kinda fun, but you can get banned if youre too good in a low skillbracket. just saying.",2
"very exciting an fun game at times i stink but at other times i cant wait to breeze through a match",3
"it`s a very weird fps, but in a good way it has a diffrent play style then the multiable othe fps i played and thats why i like it so much! :d",3
"i call this type of game a gun game, a game where all the info you need to know is the fact that you have a gun, and ya know what, i despise this game. i really do. yet i always manage to come back to this game. all in all its a good game, a great game. it controls fluently, the community isnt awful, the guns are nice and responsive, the game feel is fantastic, and for the most part everything usually works. now what really soured the experience of cs:go for me was the inclusion of weapon skins, it turned to game from man that guy is really good to oh, this jackass has a $400 knife now this may be nitpicky, but when youve played dust ii 12 times in a row because people refuse to pick otherwise, youre allowed to get annoyed at simple things. anyway thats my two cents on the matter, i recommend this for people who like the gun game genre.",1
"this gaem is fun and you should play it. but if you have the chance to plant and you dont take it when there is 10 seconds left on the clock and the enemy team is on the other side of the map then you are a bad bad person and you should not play this game",1

"great game. not as good as css but far more approachable at this point.",2
"counter-strike: global offensive enough said :d (_)",4
"recommend this game will get you the feel of old fps games like cs 1.6 or crossfire with a new improved graphic. in game console enable help you customize for your liking. (require google though, there isnt any in game official guide for that) easy to hop in and play. many mode/map available to play. but i play a lot and not spotted a hacker yet but its seem to be a problem for many players. recoil is not new player friendly and you gotta learn some tricks to use it.",2

"i was called a  for using the pp-bizon. 11/10 ign its meh",1
"my opinion on cs: go when i looked at counter strike: gos page i was not that intrested, it looked alot like cod i had alot of bad happen to me things like hackers, cheaters, people that troll and a hacker resetted all my stats and more, so looking at this game i wasnt really intrested but when steam decided to put it down to $6 (i think) from $15 i then wanted to get it not doing any homework on this game i guess you could say i yolo ed so i got it and... wow its awesome love the consept torrists (t) plant the bomb counter torrists (ct) have to defuse it seems simple but fun if you like tf2 then i highly recomend getting this game because like tf2 you can get your own weapons and rare ones too, its so content when you got your first rare weapon and you want to check it out right away i love this game. my rating: 8/10 could do with a controler setting could do with a match making option so i dont get pwned by pros",1
"unlike other shooty-shooty blam-blam fpses, counter strike is yolo: at war. (yes, yolo. deal with it.) fun, exciting, tense gamemodes and now, weapon drops make it a timeless classic.",1

"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",1
"i like it! :d this is my 3rd cs:go account but its totaly worth it!",3
"when i got this game i was like this will be fun. it was fun, but i also didnt get any pasta or any food for that matter. why, why wouldnt valve add food to one of their greatest games aside from others of course. this is because of call of duty. since call of duty did not include food valve thought we dont need food with their great success. this is why call of duty sucks.",1
"huge learning curve from the run n gun cod/battlefield titles i grew up with. once you break the habit of relying on ads and spraying everywhere, this can be a great game. when you do finally get the hang of it (13 hours in for me) there is a very rewarding feeling you get when actually doing good for a few rounds. definitely recommend this game.",3
"i definetley recommend this game. such a fun, competitive game. love the competitiveness and the casual play options. good game for the heavy pro gamers and the light, casual gamers. overall, an awesome game.",4

"always loved how out of all the fps games, i stayed with this one. its simple, yet very complicated especially dealing with each guns recoil. this game has been nothing but everlasting fun and the competitve matches are so intense and filled with excitement. i dont think this game can ever become boring to me and to see it still coming with new content like maps and gun skins is amazing! if you got money to throw, deffinitely try this game for it is highly recommended and you will deffinitely worth your money.",1

"great game, the counter strike series never disappoints. for those considering purchasing know that this game is by no means easy. but if you put the practice in its totally worth it. the competitive community is amazing, from esea to cevo, to huge events like esl, this game leads the way in competitive gaming and opens doors to be noticed for a chance to compete in the professional leagues. would recommend to anyone that enjoys a good fps.",3

"this game seriously owns hard. im barely at an acceptable level in terms of skill and game knowledge but ive never felt so badass for doing well (kda) or making a sick clutch 1v3 or knifing some fool who is reloading around the corner. steep learning curve but very rewarding and satisfying to improve at. also its counterstrike; you literally cannot go wrong.",1

"if this game was a potato it would be a good potato.",1
"excellent game, well worth the money. servers could do with being faster but thats my only complaint. no need to spend money after purchase, anything you would spend money on is purely for looks and does not give you an advantage. all in all, i love this game.",1
"this game on the other hand is purely awesome. its different in many ways, it takes a while before you get used to the aiming system though. compared to other fps(first person shooter) games. but when you do. ohgod, the game is amazingly fun and they even got this mode (competitive ~ ranked) you can play. its 10 games then you get your rank and youll be playing against players at your own level. so i strongly recommend this game if you are looking for a new fps game. the only bad thing about this game as ive noticed so far is that it eats away some of my money, but there i am at fault myself.. but i enjoy having new weapon skins so a man gotta do what a man gotta do yknow. other than that the game itself is flawless! my opinion ~ rate: 10/10",2

"one of the best first person shooters on the market simple, clean, practically no bugs, good maps.",1

(the worst is 7 days) 2. if your pc fell out while playing competive u get banned for competive (first time 30/1h second time 24 h thirth time 7 days...) 3. some offensive people online all in its worth buying though,havent enjoyed a shooter this much in a while!",1

"hard game for beginners but eventually its fun. this is the first fps game ive played that demands careful shots thanks to recoil than bullet spamming enemies once theyre in your crosshair. the bullet penetration adds the real-world flavour and theres even a warmup round for shooting just about anywhere even that filthy hostage if youre on terrorist side. 10/10 would recommend for challenge-seeking/competitive gamers mostly but not so for the easy-going casual fps gamers who prefer continuous bullet spam.",1

"this is the first fps to actually captivate me and keep me coming back, unlike cod this game actually requires strategies and skill opposed to the random spraying that normally happens in cod. csgo is filled with actually nice people who instead of calling you a noob try to encourage learning. this game has captivated me for the past month and a half and i hope it captivates me until the next counter strike comes out. +1.",2

"this is one of the best fps ever , it isnt like call of duty or battlefield or halo or anyother fps ; it redefines the franchise that is probably the god of fps . it not only features the fast-paced and skill-based casual game mode but it introduces new modes like arms race , demolitions and team deathmatch ( which is quite popular in most fps games ) . i certainly recommend this to any fps fan out there ( unless you hate the classics ) . the balance in all guns is amazing , most fps games like cod and battlefield dont have a balance in the guns and so a guy who is a level or two above you has an advantage over you as he has the better gun . in cs go you dont need level or stuff , just a bit of skill and you are good to join the combat .",1

"good game besides the russian people you sometimes have to play with.",1
"there used to be a large barrier to entry for this franchise, it is the main reason i did not play cs: source very much. the players were impossible to play against. this game is much more friendly to those who are new and allowed me to finally get a real feel for it. after playing multiple casual modes, this game is the most fun arcadey fps game i have played.",1
"very good gameplay, the tactical gameplay is so engaging and the meta game makes my brain pump! the graphics are nice to look at, the sound design is amazing, and the game balance is top notch. not a cod clone -59234/10",3
"the king of tactical fps games, hands down. counter strike global offensive has well balanced gameplay and relies heavily on pure skill, and when you play hardcore its amazing. theres always new maps, camos, and stickers made by valve and the community. it is very well optimized and runs super smooth on most modern computers! i highly recommend this game to anyone who likes fps games. 10/10",1
"i dont even own this game....why is it letting me review it. 10/10",1
"of course cs:go also has the classic server browser, wherein you can browse the servers, search them by tags/maps/player count/ping, regular stuff. some of these servers also feature funmodes, which you can play when you feel like playing cs:go but you cba to tryhard. most of those servers are noob-friendly. this game gets constant updates, which means tweaks to guns if some are deemed overpowered or underpowered, new skins, new operations, new maps, and more. be sure to have your credit card ready when these things happen, though!",2
"this game is so uguu. i play with my friends its full of ha-to and burning passion of nakama. i like when i get the gun and i shoot with much incredible sniper action. the p90 is also the most kawaiiest gun i have ever seen and it makes my mune go kyuuuun. i highly recommend this for tomodachitachis and oniichans that want to have the most tanosi time together with incredible feeling building within nakama. highly recommend to buy kawaii killer sticker and dress up your guns like idolmaster game.",3

"i play the game almost every day. i get on, expect to do good, and then get destroyed. i hate that i am addicted to the game, and love that its so addicting. this game is my cocaine. in all honesty if i could only own one game, it would still be skyrim though. cs:go is a close second.",2
"counter-strike: global offensive is awesome, the overall game is extremely good and you must have it. it has a good inventory system and really good weapons. this game has improved a lot from the last couple of years. you must get this game!",1
"this game is very hard on new players who want to play competetive. congradulations! you were just put against a team of all golds and you havent even won 10 games yet! even better, your team mates will mock you for not being good at the game. whats that? you want to play with players your own skill? to bad! with our match making system you will feel like  and never get to ten wins unless you have 30 loses! and your team mates will remind you it is your fault! who the  am i kidding though right? no one is going to read this and think i tried my hardest. i have 57 hours in the game and havent even reached ten wins competetive yet because i am being paired against people who are all gold. thanks for the great match making system, now where is my gibus for this game so that people know not to yell at me and just accept that i am new?",1

"counterstrike is a staple for anybody who is a fan of shooters. gone are ranks, classes and other modern tropes leaving only challenging skill based gameplay. you will suck. you will be headshot. you will get better. when you do and decide to visit another game you will realize how casual shooters have become.",1
"this is probably the biggest abomination of  ive ever played, nothing makes sense and theres always this one guy on your team who doesnt stop buying the p90 then rushing into their team screaming russian communist chants while you pray that the guy with the massive flourescent automatic sniper rifle in the back doesnt kill your whole team in one shot when they inevitably line up and run towards him in a forward march. well he does, and then youre all alone on half health after being hit by a grenade and flashbanged 12 times. you finally get killed when the one guy whod been afk the whole game comes round and kills you in one shot, before you see that the same p90 guy has finally said something to his team. omg noob kick me 5 stars.",2
"just bought this game and it is so awesome but not so awesome for my steam wallet-i ive already spent 50 euro on it",1
"yes. of course, this is the best game if i ever experience! but! some motherfuc#ers fuc# us when we play match. please do not play match if you buy now. practice with bot, and if you think you can win when you fight with a expert bot, play at the community server or casual mode. if not, youll get dam# silvers! if you get silvers rank group, teammates are troll: 20% of the whole matches which you play. and meet smurfs or meet hacker: 10% of the whole matches which you play. so, please follow my review whose wanna buy csgo or have a plan to buy csgo. and this game also offer skin system. but!! dont purchase skin as you can! if you dont wanna wasted money, please do not purchase skin never!",3
"hands downt the best pure fps on the market. this is a staple for someone wanting to break into competitve gaming and wants to learn how tactics and teamplay is valued. you dont have to worry about leveling up or someone having a better gun then you or attachement, everyone has access to all the same guns making it a completely balanced game. it also offers a very enjoyable casual community and deathmatch for just having fun. countless amounts of custom servers with addons and mods that add tons of variety to an already near perfect game. the game is constantly updated and improved upon by developers that actively listen to the community.",5

"well.. i think only those cheaters is the downside to this game in mm. dev should really solve this, otherwise it will only ruin all the image this game had built in this past year. i mean consistent shoot through smoke, guarding a smaller bomb site with 80% of your squad in a buy round, really? are they pshycic or something? aside of the negative thing, there are a lot of great ideas i love in this game. its more eye candy than the last one i played (cs1.6), got custom skins that in the end will support more professional play, and i hope there will be more great ideas coming. edit: a new cheated experience.. as ct, as soon as you turn around for another spot, the t just go out to shoot your back.. like 7 deatch in ct are all in that condition.. nice isnt it?",5

"get banned for a week for voting to kick a teamate 10/10 would kick again.",1
"this game is a bit different from css in graphics, gameplay, in-game events. in that words i want to say that it is much better than css. i play it quite often with friends and often this game brings me sea of emotions. i can be angry because it is too difficult to compete, or i can be happy because i did my best in particular match. anyway, the game is very fun to play with friends. but playing alone will also bring u happiness and help to make new friends. i recommend it, it is classic of the genre.",2
"great game, bit of a learning curve. nothing you cant handle. ;p 9.6/10",4
"look at the positive review rate.... need i say more?",1
"bought this game, played online, learned fluent russian 2 weeks later.",1
"no dont get me wrong this is a nice game, ill admit im not the most avid csgo player but im learning. the problem however is based on the community as a result of all the skins and knifes in the game. the second you buy this game you will get pestered with the bots that want to steal from you, it basically comes down to if their profile is private them block them and or report them. the community of this game is pretty toxic as well which i dont like, i feel as if this game has been ruined by the silly actions of people. dont fall into the skins rubbish its a massive cash grab.",1
"couter-strike global offensive is a very smart game. its a game thats too smart to just say hey, heres a gun, go send some guys to hell... its a game that tells you that but also tells you and those guys are all smarter, stronger, better and everything you can imagine than you. its a game that keeps you on your toes every minute your playing it. counter-strike is a series of games that have a huge community. who never spent days, months, years playing cs 1.6? it has some very talented players playing it and if youre not prepared for it, your gonna get stomped by them. youre probably going to spend a lot of hours in the spectator mode, but you know what? thats just fine. its going to be hard, its going to be frustrating, but thats the fun! learning from your mistakes is fun and after a lot of practice, your going to love this game. after all that time, your going to realise why this is such a popular game.",2

"awesome game. it has the gameplay of 1.6 which is fast and has superb graphics. its a mustplay game.",3
"currently one of the best and only real competitive fps out there. a great variety of weaponry and maps. the game also gets constant updates from community feedback. however it has a vey big learning curve. for the first 50 hours or so you wont be very good at the game. as long as you get decent skill after that, you will have alot more fun.",1
"you get this game, and for a while, you suck. then, you start getting better and better, until you reach the point where you play competitive. then, you realise you suck all over again. 10/10",3
"amazing game, great time playing competitive dispite the bad news i have heard from other gamers. best played with friends",1
"best counter strike game so far tbh, great steam service on it, community is okay-ish not fully hacked like the other cs games (well atleast not yet) very smooth and lastly fun as hell.",4
"the graphics are very amazing. the sounds are very simular to the real gun sounds. and of course, when you play the game, you get camos or if you want them at the moment youve bought the game, you can buy boxes with camos in it!",1
"counter-strike: global offensive the game that killed my life in one way or a nother. its a very good tactical shooter. it is senserely a good game by valve +community +chill game +teamwork +workshop (community made maps,guns,stickers) -can feel a bit laggy for time too time (network) -hackers (they fastly ban hackers but it can bee a problem. but they have fixed the comp system when playig whit a hacker or againts a hacker( it erases the match if you lose but noting if you manage to winn agients a hacker) -the persons that play competetive and are not ready yet soo this is a very good game but needs work in some plases but its totaly whort the mony. disclaimer this is not cod/bf this is a realy hard game too some extent you need to learn every thing again this is a realy good game and i will give it a 10/10 as of my experiense but a 9/10 if u count the networck problems (and no its not on my side) valve you have done it again",4

"its a good game if you enjoy: teamwork fast paced russians shooters  rage ranking systems",2
"a seriously addictive tactical shooter that relives the good old days of cs:s with advanced graphics, maps, guns, and skins.",1
"great instalment to the sceries with a great community driven economy that you can accualy get steam money from if you play it right. normaly microtransactions are bad, but you dont have to pay to sell a case for four dollars and all purchaces are purely asthetics that dont alter gameplay at all (exept for making you feel mor bada**:)",1
"i think this game is pretty awesome. i enjoyed it a lot.",1
"so fun, especially in custom servers like minigames or jailbreak. great new game modes compared to old counter strike games. not so long ago, they implemented a skins update where people (and valve) make a profit from all the skins they sell and trade with each other. its a great way to show yourself to others through skins. (and to show that you can afford some or to brag :p)",3
"for a global offensive theres only like 15 maps and none of them are particularly new or interesting; fun to shoot things off of buildings though",1
"where to start? this game has it all. great graphics, plenty of guns (including awesome camoflauges), and a large community. while it may not have as many maps as cs:s, or buggy bots, the tactical gameplay makes up for these flaws. all in all, i would say this is a must play for a big fps fan. 8.5/10",1
"fps based on the half-life engine. i just wish they would stop with the updates. fix problems, but leave the game alone.",3
"one of the best fps games i have ever played. the change from source is massive. adds highly modified maps and gun textures are awesome. all in all, its a great game to play. the community however is the worst. people dont help new players and they are generally abused and sweared at. the community is very unforgiving. gameplay wise this game ranks at the top. its not at all easy for pro players of counter strike family of games to get a hang of global offensive quickly. many prompt fixes, many new guns, many new skins added regularly, makes it an awesome experience. ill give it a score of 8.5/10",1

"cs:go is actually surprisingly fun, even though i dont play very often. tis a great game to relieve stress and aggression into.. i should probably check what its like against real players, since the highest difficulty bots are a joke. :)",1
"this game is awesome however when it goes on sale be ready for the hackers/trolls. otherwise i really recommend this game its really fun but has a learning curve. if you buy it have fun! solo q can be hard at times but you can meet many cool people. as apl would say god bless everyone!",2
"get this game, its ony 15 dollars, i bought it when it came out and it had alot more that was worth 15 dollars but n wits being out for about 1 year and its still being upgraded, its amazing...",3

"this games is pretty cool. what i like with the game is that you can accually make money on it. i do recomend you to get it if you use to play the old counter strike games",2
"i really enjoy csgo. i am however a little annoyed with the recoil.. everything reminds me of the awesome cs 1.6 that i still regularly play...except the recoil i think thats what keeps me coming back to 1.6 is that the recoil actually makes sense the game is still good otherwise.. i would buy it again :)",3

"despite the glaring lack of client-sided modding, the included game modes offer a nice distraction from time to time. its not nearly as versatile as counter-strike: source, but it looks prettier for sure thanks to the new shaders.",1
"very good game. can play for hours on end and not get bored",1
"counter-strike: global offensive is probably my favorite game right now becuase of the possibilities in-game. you have all the weapons in the game to start of with, but there is a lot of skins to make them look better. there is a huge amount of skins you can collect from cases, marketing and betting. you can also get nice drops from missions. the game is almost all about statrategy and chemistry between players. there is also different roles. the most played gamemode is probably competetive. after 10 matches won, you will receive a rank that will organize who you are gonna play with. the ranking system is based on the elo system. there is also deathmatch, arms race and casual. the cs:go community is huge and i could easily give this game a 10/10 becuase of that.",3
"i got a pretty m4a1 then stopped playing this game. get it.",1
"i recommend this game for all the old cs 1.6 players! give it a chance as i did and you will end up loving it! i give this game 10/10 toasts.",3

"i used to play cs back in beta days up until 1.6 and then stopped for years. this game has got me hooked again and in a big way. the reimagined classic maps change just enough to feel new but stay faithful enough to the originals that i still feel at home. competitive matchmaking is worth the price of this game alone (although it could use a few improvements like better regional pairing) and brings back fond memories of getting pwnd and loving every minute of it. thanks for ruining my life (again) valve.",2
"way better than source and with a workshop. a must own for counter strike players and fans, or just go kill yourself, because your cs collection sucks without csgo. this game has dropped me about $80 in marketable items and has crate drops over $400 in market value, and the game limits to 8 drops a week to keep the items valuable, unlike tf2. great tactical shooter, last of its kind. this game is getting up there in age but based on how much they update it, its not going to be replaced for at least another two to four years. buy it on the steam black market like i did and get the whole pack for cs games for less than $15, the price of this game alone, and lets kill it. znow with linux support? i almost died.",2
"makes you feel bad about your gaming skills. 10/10",1
"one of the greatest games i have ever played, it is so enjoyable. you can play casually and mess about, or go into competitive and concentrate.",4
"this version of counter strike beatas all others, much better graphics and still the legendary cs gameplay experience remains. competitive mode is awesome!",1
"great game! fun to play all throughout it. if you loved css then i suggest you dont get this game as it is not all about minigames and gun game. it is very competitive and way more advanced the other cs games. i suggest this since it is fun all through it! :d",1
"kind of rips off mario party 8 but its still good.",1
"this game only seems only track very too professional players from eas counter-strike clones into some my matches, put i dont hate the game when play mostly on playing in bot mode, or playing some newbs or couple semi-professional player who plays from valves game like team fortress 2 and half life 2 deathmatch, and who cares about mmo, mmo is so furry as started my fanfic about soos become were-furry.",1

"round start, get stabbed by random teammate in the back and lose 30 or more hp. great game though!",1
"really a nice fps game for those who have got some fps gameplay experience. obviously bravo btw therere so many matches. but its a little bit hard for those who hasnt touched fps. and its rather different from 1.6 or 1.5. pros: balanced maps and weapons; good in-game voice chat system; gunskins and market system; hopes: i want prints :-s btw if grapic optimzed more for more fps id be glad. :-] anyway, hf&gl",1

"this game is awesome to play, but no competitive, its full of russians who have boosted accounts and they speak only in russian.",3
"i bought this the other day hoping to play with fellow newbies but it just shoves me in games with pro360hipshot bs, if i could atleast play a game where i didnt feel like the weakest link, like the bots now i know thats typical but i mean why send a person with very little to no experience play with those whove been pro since before the game came out, i like that fact that this version has skins n all, but thats only a cosmetic feature",1

"if you havent already played a counter strike game then youre doing something wrong. global offensive is just like the rest, simply improved as time progresses. best part of the counter strike series is that you know exactly what to expect from each new installment.",1

"i would highly recommend this game if you are an avid fan of the counter strike series. while this game still has the original gamemodes from the earlier counter strikes (bomb defusal and hostage rescue), it also features a new gamemode called arms race which is like gungame from cod. this game features updated graphics, easy to use ui, and even has a tutorial you can play if you are just starting out. if you dont think you are ready for public play, then take it easy with some bots set on a lower difficulty setting. this would make a great gift for a friends, or yourself.",2

"same counter strike action with minor gameplay tweaks. hitboxes tend to be better than css but still not as good as 1.6. added a cool gun skin feature for all weapons along with mystery cases to unlock these skins. a gamblers nightmare as you will probably end up spending more money on this game than you should.",3
"lovely game, fun to play alone and with friends. the community is maybe okey if you are a boy, but as a girl it can be to much sometimes. i do recommend the game!",3

"if im going to compare this, and css. i want to say, that css is more for the fun stuff, like: minigame, gungame, surf, ba_jail and etc. but cs:go, this game, its a really good game actually, in the start i was thinking it was bad. well i was wrong, this game is very good, but i think its mostly for the competitive players. btw, there is also a new game mode, demolution. if you want to play serious, you should get this instead of css. this game is worth the full price! 4.5/5",5

">3:00 am >playing cs:go casual >everyone was singing on microphone 15/10.",2
"do not buy this game. i have been a gamer since 1996 and cs player since 1998. speaking from experience. do not buy this. if you have this, quit playing for your mental health. although graphics, engine and gameplay is awesome. as always like all other valve games, community is freaking bad. worst ranking and matchmaking system in the history like in dota 2 (valves another failure although its popular.). age and maturity level is way down. no one speaks english, in 1 out of 5 games you get 1 teammate who is using mic correctly and there is a huge risk his mic quality is terrible. no one tries to communicate. this is competitive mode btw. not even public. no respect and very far from the fun enviroment. its impossible to rank up if you dont play with your friends. i have been playing cs for many years and i wont play anymore.",1
"best 3rd person rpg game ive ever played, would rate it 11/10 if possible.",2
"it is a very good game but i have a very big issue with its abnning system, where if you were to leave the game and not reconect you get a ban, fair enough so far but because many including i have not got very powerful computers if my computer were to crash during a game which it does every few games and i cant reconect fast enough i get a ban, which i find very annoying. but overall this game is a very good but its just the small things that screw this game over.",1

"i really do reccomend it its really fun to play with friends ,but the only thing i dont like is that you can get banned from comp for 7 days thats a bit to much like 2 days should be fair but other then that it really fun even if you play by yourself i had fun playing it when i first got it and none of my friends had it but then they got it and it started to get better and better so yes i do reccomend this game have fun if you do buy it just dont  around on comp cuase you can get banned from it. so 8/10",4

"its definitely a game. sometimes you can play it, others you get wallhacked or triggerbotted, sometimes both. i highly recommend this game to those that like being able to script and cheat with complete ease. also the skins are overpriced and look like trash. 4/wallhack",2

"so funny:) but many hackers and server error :( 7/10",1
"although not as good as the original counter-strike, in certain respects the game makes various improvements such as the additions of molotovs, matchmaking, skins and other general improvements like the ui. many aspects of the core gameplay has been altered resulting in a lower skill ceiling than previous generations of counter-strike however cs go still remains a competitive fps to this day with decent tournament support.",5
"this game did not contain enough dank 420 noscopes, thought it was the only 69-420 prup noscpe animal hunting game, but i ended up shooting terrorists. slapped so many children with the barrel of my awp. too clutch. way too many h4xors when you get to higher ranks. if you are silver 5 begin cutting your wrists, you are never getting anywhere. glhf you whisper in your team mates ears as you start the round while they call you a  for being sportsmanlike the entire game. put way too much in here 420 regrets but a bish is one",2

"the epitome of pure competitive skill based fps, its the one game where once you surpass the steep learning curve, every death you suffer is your fault and couldve been avoided. the drive to overtake your opponents and become hone your skills hooks its claws into you bone deep. warning: highly highly addictive, lost friends, dropped out of school, lost motivation for most other things in life. not recommended if you have prior substance abuse issues or an addictive personality.",3

"counter-strike global:offensive is such a good game",1

"this game is great! it gives nice ranks for people who spend time with the game. this game isnt pay to win. you can surf,bhop,and other fun gamemodes. the game also stands out in its competitive. ive been a call of duty player since around cod 4, i took a break from console and now i love cs. i give this 9/10. its missing a point because if your a nova you can be matched with master guardians and stuff.",4

"playing this game hurts my soul but i cant stop at this point.",2
"very fun game, however people will make fun of you/ rage of you if you dont know how to play the game correctly. once you do, it gets fun. 9.5/10. however, there are just sometimes people that youre so angry at because theyre doing so bad, or they dont speak the same language (probably english) as you, and theyre on an english server. yes, that happens sometimes, but you must learn to control yourself, those are real people behind the computer youre raging at. calm down, and think. i mean i hate it too, but yeah.",2
"counter strike: global offensive is a very competitive game and is not reccomended for all people. if you are the usual consle cod player, dont play unless you are willing to go through hours of loosing over and over. it may take some time to get used to the game but in time you will learn the tactics and knowledge to win games. there is also a unique weapon skin system employed in the game in which you can buy, sell, and trade weapon skins which gives large motive to play. this game can also be played on low spec. computers because of the source engine meaning that there can be more available players to play with. the only downside is that it doesnt run on linux! valve stop trolling us! overall, i give this game a 8/10 because of its great content, but difficult learning curve and availability to only mac and windows.",2
"yes i recommend this game you can get weapons in the game and sell and make back your money why would you not buy a game that pays for itself",3
"some guy was talking about how he had all kinds of cancers and he wanted donations. he was a funny sarcastic guy. i tried to friend him. he didnt accept. 10/10",1

"the game is really hooking, really satisfying and as the price is fine it is worth it totally. this is also one of gabens most vicious way to secretly take your money without noticing. you will once or twice add funds to your wallet, then you stop to think about it, and realize how much youve spent. next moment you find yourself opening yet again a new case, and with gaben looking behind your shoulder, once again you get nothing from it. if you have an addiction of gambling, i highly recommend this game.",3
"great sequel for a great game, counter-strike: source. smooth gameplay with twisting battles in amazing graphics. what else can you want from a fps game?",1
"this game is simply the best fps there is! why? all the reasons i can think of are listed below? lets start of simple: 1: the game is cheaper than most other titles in the genre, and still it delivers extremly solid gameplay value. 2:other shooting games may get boring overtime but this games competetive gamemode keeps every match exiting. 3:both reflexes, skill and teamwork is important so if youre a  dont buy this game. 4:the overwatch system and the brilliant steam support team keeps the hackers away! 5:the community.......the community is what really, really makes the game so great!(atleast 90% of it) 6:im just gonna say it.... im addicted to skin collecting and box opening, chances are that you will become addicted aswel!",4
"you either die a noob or live long enough to get called a hacker",4
"totally the best game ever! this is not just a fps game. the guns have recoil, which means the gameplay becomes more realistic. the story is the same as source or 1.6. there are terrorists and counter-terrorists. the terrorists plant a bomb or guard hostages and the counter-terrorists try to defuse the bomb or save the hostages. it is also an awesome game for traders, because you can trade the in-game weapons. highly recommended for everyone!",3
"i suck so bad at this game, i started as a silver 1 and just ranked to silver 2... really fun and addicting game 10/10",1
"brilliant game, bought it ages ago and still play whenever i can! every match is different, the gameplay is fluid and controlled and i really do have great fun playing!",1
"never play this f@@king game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you still love your family your life...dont ever play csgo",3
"basically the same shooting game you have played 1000 times, but if you are obsessed with being the best or smtg, then ranked is for you. most common languages you will meet is english and russian. best of it, is that if you are pist off by noobs, you don`t have to worry about it here. once you gain high rank you will play only with similar ranks. you can find interesting events and communities and hey - mby even friends. and if you have friends, you can play ranked together. the first thing i recommend - never ever shoot teammates in first second and never ever leave ranked. penalty is ridiculously high. and if you think that 11eur is too much, you can always wait for discounts like 50% & 75% off which is nice.",2

"honestly, the match-making system in this game is worst then cod, youll rarely find good team mates, but you will find amazingly good enemy teams who are always toxic and rude. and get this, this game is based of its competetive game type. the servers? not even 128tick, talk about caring about the game. also, id like to state the games hit boxes are just plain stupid. and realism? never, the games engine makes it so bullets are fired into possible direction like your crumbling up a cookie and throwing it. pretty much the game is just so ing hyped by its god damn community its crazy, and they make it seem good, which in reality, when you get down to it, its just mainly bull . but! good price for it.",3
"i really recomment this game for those who like fps and competitive games. i think its really fun to play and doesnt get boring. the game is always improving because volvo and holy gaben care about it and make lots of updates and patches for it. the competitive matchmaking is well-developed; there are of course some cheaters but i think there arent as many of them as in other fpss. and the game is very cheap compared to the stuff in it. in other words: nearly perfect.",2

"opinion changed: this is fun game to play. but dont play casual games. i suggest playing ranked matches. casual are crawling with cheaters. its amazing that when i play ranked game my kd ratio is easily around 1,5-2 or higher, but when i play casual, i can barely get a kill. i was about to deinstall this game, when i decided to give it another shot with competitive matches.",2

"this game is very good, it takes actual tactical skill while other shooters like cod are based on twitch gaming. but this game is very hard if you are new you will die and die in your first matches by people who have 5 years expirience. pros -good gameplay -very tactical -fun -the guns are cool and accurate to real life. cons -community is o.k. -not noob friendly",1

"as someone who has played years of the call of duty and battlefield franchises, ive really grown to like this game. it has the usual fps feel, but of course the physics take some time to get used to when switching from other similar games. there is a lot more team work required, especially when playing competative, a game format which becomes addictive. everyone is going to like different games for different reasons, but for a game that is a quarter of the price of mainstream commercial products, this is where ive been spending my time.",1

"this review is pointless.. but you see i thumbs up. so you and i know this game is... good af.",1
"despite its age, csgo seems to be getting more and more popular! its easy to see why though, its a solid fps with great gun controls (cod kids will be put off when they realise they cant spray n pray). it offers lots of modes to ease you in, so you dont have to jump straight in to the competitive matches. team deathmatch, gun game, demolition and community servers are all available to let you get used to the game. the game also has cases that contains new skins, they dont do anything to your gun other than change its look, but some of them can be worth a lot of money (certain knives can be sold for around 200) if youre lucky enough to get 1. be warned though, a key to a case is 1.59, and unlocking a knife is like winning the lottery! the only bad thing about the game is the amount of hackers/trolls. lots of matches have been spoiled by someone obviously cheating, or a troll just out to annoy others...",2
"in 2009, the first time i tried counter strike 1.6 non-steam, it was a remarkable game. i started playing at public / deathrun / surf servers. in 2011, i bought counter strike: source on steam accounts. those who had little time to steam, but the time to buy. in 2011, all looked counter strike: global offensive trailer. what will happen in 2012, and people talk about the end of the world. so come 2012, there counter strike global offensive, people rush to buy it, including myself. i bought this game from donaiteris samp server. so i started playing it after playing purchased together, i was too heavy to move, because i played a little counter-strike: source, which are the same gameconnect projects and shooting. but now i can say that counter strike global: offensive game is really good, and are among the best games of my list.",2

"this is easily one of the best shooters out there. definitely worth the $15. if it was more i would be willing to pay more. great game, if youre new to counter-strike, itll take some time to get used to. youre not going to go 30-5 every single game.",1

"if youre reading this review and dont have the game, youre doing something wrong.",1

"hey why csgo has been revoke need the game back !!!!!!",1
"spend alot of time aquiring skins or failing miserably at competitive. 420/666 would buy a happy meal for gaben.",4
"the best how the  did that not hit simulator there is.",1
"probably the best fps. this game isnt about unlocking that front grip for your shotgun, or unlocking the awesome trickshot sniper on level 30. this game is about pure strategy and teamwork.",2
"the perfect sequel to cs:s, this game will pay for itself with its skin drops. absolutely worth purchasing.",1
"disturbingly bad hit detection/tick-rate, wont be playing this sh!t seriously until the tick-rate is fixed, its been way to long now with this bs.",1

"it would be a great game if it werent for the russians.",2
"if you hate call of duty but like to shoot stuff, this is for you. its team based mechanics work well and its very fun to see your team accomplish your goals. this is the only first person shooter that executes a hostage rescue/bomb scenario extremly well. 11/10 would shoot more terrorists",1
"incredible game, awesome community. well worth $15.",1
"fun but remember most valve games require teamwork so back your teammates up",1
"its like roulette; fun until it turns into russian.",1
"keep calm and blame the lag 10/10 would rage again",1
"counter strike globally offensive is an excellent game overall. the dynamics of the game make fun and interesting for a long lasting time. i have played this game for almost 500 hours and i assure you i will continue playing because there are endless oppertunites of things you can do in this game including competitve, casual, deathmatch, arms race, and the workshop. also you can get skins for your weapons which adds a personality factor to the game and their are multiple ways to get skins you can buy a key and case; and unlock the case with the key; but when you do that you have random chances of geting an asortment of skins. the grand prize however is a knife which can be worth alot of irl money. so overall i would give this game a 10 out of 10 in my opinion",2
"sucked at first round of competitive, team kicked me and got banned. 10/10",5
"awesome! a superb revision from the counter-strike saga. global offensives match making tools make the interface user-friendly and the gun collection is a great feature, especially the eye candy that can be viewed amongst the community. the mechanics of the game perform outstandingly, and the feel to the game is irreplaceable. over all this is an amazing version of the game, and for 15$ it is unbeatable in the fps genre!",3
"a very amazing game i fell in love with the competitive mode becuz everyone uses teamwork and they talk no hate just teamwork:)",2
"i highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys high action first-person shooters! this gamecan be very intense and having the choice of playing offline or online with bots is amazing! if you die, you can also take control of your teammates. i have to war you though, you only have 1 respawn when playing online! overall great game scale on 1-10.... 11/10 for me",1
"this game ruined my life, i almost killed my mom during competitive because of russians and gabe took all of my money 10/10 would play again",5
"100% one of the best fps games out there. extremley different from the cod franchise, but much better ;)",5
"dont try to win. youll lose. try to lose. youll win. 10/10 matchmaking",3
"it is still the same gameplay as cs 1.6. improved graphics, good community, even with some annoying kids with their mirophone on, yelling around. the skins are some really damn good and really beautifull ones but the bad luck in the opening crates makes it really hard to get good items. still you can have cool skins for about 4 cents if youre not after the rare skins... even so, this game is worth buying!",1
"i really like this game, its pretty balanced, but there is to much cheaters now days.",4
"i would recommend you pick up this game if youre a fan of counter-strike games. the communication is great and you can have a lot of fun with friends. the competitive play is also really interesting and intense. i would rate this game a 8 out of 10.",1
"11/10 would bang! an amazing (not  all the time) fps that will change the way you play everything",2

"you will play and get better, then you will get annoyed at all who arent good... then you will buy keys to get skins and lose lots of money. overall you will have fun. cs:go 2014",2

"if you arent a hamplanet social justice warrior then you should buy this game",2
"this game is not counter strike, no. it is full of , mentally ill people, russians, hackers and call of duty community. dont buy it.",1
"good game obviously. just buying the keys are not worth it.",1
"an entertaining fast paced game which is totally value for money. the different game modes such as arms race, demolition and deathmatch are a bonus along with the regular classic way of playing. not getting bored any time soon :)",1
"great for competetive matches on classic maps like inferno and dust 2, has a very good ranking system that matches you up with players of your own skill level. the only problem with it is that surfing and other custom game modes arent really as good as source.",2

"who needs rosetta stone when you got the entire cs:go community to help you learn russian? 10/10    .",2
"this game plays so well, the in-game matchmaking system is pretty good despite what others might say. the graphics in this game are better than in cs:s, enough to be a nice difference but not enough to blind you. the buy menu in this game is a vast improvement over the previous ones, where memorizing hotkeys were necessary. the workshop and the combination of the operations makes for a game that doesnt get old. 10/10",2
"a very awesome game with lots of variety of gun skins.... best counter strike game i have played in years!!!!",2
"<3 awesome game,awesome franchise,always fun to kill someone with shotguns :)",3

"unboxed a case, missed an awp asiimov and got a tec-9 sandstorm, named it darude sandstorm 10/10 would unbox again.",5
"one of the best fps games ive ever played. it also requires skill to be good at it as compared to cod. learning curve to become average/decent is quite the distance but i love almost everything about this game. only problem i dont like is how you cant have a second button for the same action. other than that, it definitely is a must-buy in my opinion. 10/10 p.s not as much  deaths as compared to cod.",4
"who played in the counter strike 1.6 i advise everyone to this game",3
"counter strike is one of the most fast pace but also stratigic fps games you can play. 5v5 comp is excilerating popping off heads and masacering the other team, awesome ^^ bring out the competed mode overall 5 out of 5 stars",3
"best game ive ever played. better than cod, battlefield and other fps because its unique gameplay, strategies and the community.",3
"there is no way of getting bored of this game. totally worth buying!",2
"plays more like cs 1.6 than cs:source. definitely recommend.",1
"ready? *clicks ready* 10 people accept round #1 one guy leaves before the round starts round #2 we are leading either way round#3 now we have two bots, i thought they confermed they were ready ttt round#4 we loose round #5 close win round #6 guy wants a kick but doesnt want to surrender even though 2/3 wanted to surrender, round #7 we kick the guy, hes so freaking dumb he gets a day ban well kk round #8 it just started we are loosing, alright time to try to clutch.... or no.. that one guy on my team kicks me.. now the game is basically saying you have a cooldown for too many kicks wot that was like my first kick well alright -restarts cs- what!! 7 days? really valve....  cooldown sys good game 7/10",1
"great game. easy to get used to, awesome gameplay. maps are nice, never gets boring.",1
"a very nice game that takes allot of skill, one of the best multiplayer shooters ive ever seen and i like shooters allot.the only downside is coming a cross hackers once in a while, but then again its fun trolling those hackers. this game will give you allot of funtimes and sometimes sadtimes because you suck.",2
"a lot better than source. thats all i have to say.",2
"this game is very fun and addicting. it makes you wanna play match after match. i like the realistic damage of the weapons as well. i also think the addition of weapon camos is great, and it adds a social aspect, trading. i recommend this game, but not for people who enjoy call of dutys fast-paced combat and killstreaks. this game is much more strategically based.",1
"actually i would not recommend this game for people who want to have a real social life , because for me 25 years old man who cant stop playing even after graduation and having a job , to be honest this game is so addictive",3
"bought the game on sale. made back all my money by selling items i got in game. best part of all i suck at the game.",1
"very excellent game, it has a closer feel to the cs 1.6 along with a few changes that only improve the game for the better. the game is slick and smooth and strong in the competitive side. being a cs player for over 7 years i can say this game has gotten to me most. the added ranking system along with dedicated servers to play competitve mode just makes cs much more appealing than it used to be. also, they added skins to the game in which you can make your guns look beautiful as you go around on your tactical killing sprees. for veteran and new coming counter-strike players. it is the fps game to get. if you arent so sure it will be worth your $15.00, you can always get it for $5.00 on steam sale. either way...it is a purchase you will not regret.",1
"in a breeze, i highly recommended this game. dont give up at first, it is hard to master, well it is true in any kind of game. go practice shooting at training_aim_csgo available in the workshop. every pro and newbie come here everyday to practice shooting, just like real shooting field ;-)",1
"if you dont get head-shots everytime, you are automatically a scrub and a noob. this game is basically for the pros, soz twelvies this aint cod.",2
"one of the best tactical shooters of all time. constant patching/updates based on community feedback, strong and huge fanbase / community, excellent and smooth graphic quality. excellent competitive scene worldwide, very good matchmaking and ranking system, weapon skins that dont affect gameplay or balance. you cant ask for more.",2
"this game is so fun and also very basic but u cant go wrong with this game. and its ok to call hacks here and there",1
"starting with 1.6 till now cs simply ,,, the best game ever !!",2
"one of my favourtie games ez money maker for steam games and one of the best fps ever made :d thumbs up",3

"after release was a resource , most issues have been fixed and the game is moslty playable. only gripe i have aling many others is the lack on 128 tic competative servers and so i have found myself playing on private comp servers of late.",3
"it is indeed a new name for the cs series which was first launched before 12 years ago. this game dose bring a whole new meaning for the cs franchise , at first it was a normal fps game launched by valve and then it got turned out like tf2 , weapon skins .. seriously valve ? cant you get enough with your money ? so you made this good game into a complete  game ? now days people are just buying skins and buying keys and cases , but for what ? what point ? isnt the point to play this game ? normally ? like any other good fps games ? i like this game without any valve addition to it.",1

"broke my kneecaps to the theme tune of this game. totally worth it because i made the nhs and i can fix it.",1
"its a good game. with good graphics. the maps looks very good and have a great texture. this game can almost be played on every pc cuz it dont ask a lot of the pc. and haves almost no lagg. the character models and weapons can maybe get improved a bit cuz they dont look really good in my opinion. if u have a weapon with a skin the weapon looks great. so maybe the character model can get improved a bit. for the rest its a great game. + points : no lagg. good graphics. nice weapon skins. great maps. - points : the character models",1

"i would recommend older counter strikes rather than this game even if i give this game a 9.5/10, i would rather play some css than this. with upgraded grapichs and now that you can have items skins on your weapons , this game became like tf2 good game with horribly community and overhyped/overpriced items like ak-47 vulcan wich is like 50$ fun to play with friends but i gotta say that this game is pretty fast made i mean its one of those: quick! we need to make some money but how?... how bout a sequel to counter strike to make money on! oh and make it like tf2 with keys and crates all dat crap! okay i was a little hard against csgo but i can still see taht valve added some love this game. and do not get me started on the knifes... 9.5 awp out of 10 awp!",1

"after getting killed 5000000 times, i finally got a kill. oh wait, it was just an assist.",1
"this is an amazing 10 out of 10 competitive ,team-based, fps for the pc, that has all the emphases on team. this game is non-stop action that requirs constant comunication, and fast reactions. this is no cod, or battlefield, this is hardcore, no jokes. the basic idea of the game is , 5 on 5 terrorists vs counter terrorist. the terroritsts have to plant a bomb on 1 of 2 bombsites. the counter-terorists need to either kill all the terrorits, defuse the bomb, or prevent the terrorests from planting the bomb in 2 minites. easier said then done. -stay low, move fast, shoot first, die last,one shot, one kill, no luck, pure skill.",3
"whats so amazing with cs is that it has now been around for 14 years! and its still stong and will probably keep being strong for the next decade as well. its such a simple concept. 2 teams, one team defend the bombsite another attack it. its amazing how thrilling it can be to play and watch cs. cs:go is definitly the new fresh air that the cs franchice needs. the graphics are better, competitive play, official skins etc. there is only improvment coming from valve and itll probably become even a better game as the years go by. its a great game and if you like the previous or any cs games i strongly suggest you pick this game up! 10/10",2

"i play this game alot i recomend it to alot players if u even know what is counter strike 1.6 or 1.5",2
"i play offline alot, so i was excited to find that counter-strike: global offensive had an offline with bots feature. it is really fun to kill bots and defuse bombs as a counter-terrorist. its also kind of funny when you spectate a bot to find that they have horrible accuracy. i like using shotgun weapon, and testing out cs:go skins on an offline server without bots. i do recommend this game.",1
"much better than cross fire. definitely recommend :x",1
"counter-strike, the fps series that will ruin your ability to do life, but kill srubs and enjoy teamwork based gamemodes without having to hear children b***h about things. best of all you dont have to buy a new one every two or so years, or have to deal with origin. what more could you possibly want? answer: camos, lots and lots of camos! 89.50/100",2
"one of the best multiplayer shooters out there! great community and support for the game including regular updates and new content from valve and players! simple premise to each game mode that can be explored complexly or simply enjoyed. a must have for any shooter fan! 11/10",2
"my rules to win in csgo: 1. buy nova 2. shoot teamates in the head 3. get 7 day ban 4. gg alt route: 1. buy incendiary/molotov 2. burn teamates while defusing/planting bomb 3. get 7 day ban 4. gg",3
"brilliant game, i have played counter strike for many months now and all i can say is it is truely amazing. you can have endless fun playing both tactically in competitive matches, or for some general fun and banter in casual, deathmatch or arms race. would thoroughly recomend the purchase of counter-strike: global offensive",2
"the game where everyone worse than you is low, russian or a noob whereas everyone better is a lucker, hacker or smurf noob 10/10",3
"very good game with realistic graphics! keep it up source and valve!",1
"its freaking counter-strike why you even need a recommendation , its one of the best fps game out there !",2
". that means you are a stupid , i learnt that from this game so many russians........ so many russians........ 6.9/10 would play again,  the chickens, this game stole my money for cases good job gaben, would play again after i get more money so many russians........ is this enough already? dont play the game, open cases, you will uninstall eventually, youre welcome goodbye (so many russians........)",2
"boring ,  community a  load of traders obssesed with shiny weapons and everyone is a tryhard that should take games less seriously.",1
"its fine to play with friends, although i suck and never hit anything.",1
"this game is probably one of the best $15 dollars ive spent in a long time. there are many aspects of this game, ranging from highly competetive play, to community servers. it can be frustrating at times, and there is a moderate learning curve for new players, but if you get the hang of it, then you can really have a lot of fun with this game.",2
"pretty impressed at the fact that valve improved the graphics quite a lot and added a few more game modes like arms race etc. which does make it a bit cod-ish but still the simplicity of the counter-strike series was maintained. although many new maps were added, we still notice the classic maps like dust, dust2, aztec etc. its not a very fast paced fps like cod or bf yet its very enjoyable to play.",1
"tried to stab a member of the opposing team in an act of sportsmanship, got shot in the face. what has our world come to? 10/10 would stab again.",1
"once a guy on my team shot me and then i shot him in the head and got banned for a week. 10/10",1
"i have played cod, bf3, bf4... but for some reason i always get back to counter-strike... thumbs up valve!",2
"i shot a chicken and it blew up. i lost a hostage. 11/10",1
"vey very nive game teh best game in the world for me",4
"for a cod or bf player this game might be a bit harsh in the beginning. recoil is so different, moving affects your ability to shoot accurately etc. besides those points above, by far the best 1st person shooter ive ever played.",2
"great game, recommended for fps (first person shooter) gamers or people that just started.",3
"i kill once every 15 minutes so my friends dont invite me no more but it is a nice game!",1
"great game, much much time invested. me love this game more then life itself.",3
"modern version of counterstrike. ok. i liked to play cs 1.6 with some friends sometimes, was never really competitive, but this game allows for that if its youre thing. story: x (is there one? i havent played it.) gameplay: 10/10 presentation: 9/10 (could be battlefield.) soundtrack: 9/10 (good not great, not repetitive like it could be.) replayability: 8/10 (not as free as other games, but still competitive etc.)",1
"if you dont want to spend your student loan on cheap larger and pot noodles but on endless cases only to get yet another galil sandstorm and         . you should get this game.",2
"really fun game! good to play with friends, also skins are addicting!",3
"one of the most fun and most frustrating games if you dont pay attention! :)",3
"a well-polished shooter that is simple to play and hard to master. learn the mechanics of this game, and you will be rewarded by a deep experience. 10/10",2
"good game, fun to play with friends and a good way for people to make money",3
"although cs:go builds on source, it doesnt feel much different. with that being said, cs:go is an incredible fps, (clearly better than cod, unfortunately just not as popular...) cs:go combines teamwork with playability, meaning youll always be on edge, whether its camping b sight or waiting for a box to open. i could say that the maps are small, but cs:go isnt a game with large maps in mind, its a 10vs10 chaos that does everything it promises. i have no problems about the game, apart from the shabby inspection table, but no one uses that.",2
"i highly reccomend this fps game because of the simple joy of it!",1
"how to become an alchoholic: 1. buy counter-strike: global offensive 2. play counter-strike: global offensive 3. drink away the pain of playing counter-strike: global offensive 10/10 would experience renal failure again",1
"this game is all about weapons, and weapon stats. good weapons, and you play better, bad weapons, and everybody will vote-kick you. skins for this game is also important. you should have a skin brighter then a flashbang for maximum effect. never buy a knife unless you are ready to break banks.",2
"if youre good at this game in competitive youll be called a hacker by kids that youve taken down. the struggle to get a good team is real, and youll have to be holding on untill you get to a higher level, where your team wont roam all over the map instead of staying on their points which leads to a defeat and your team yelling at you for not being able to get an ace while theyre flashbanging you. 10/10",1
"simply a awesome game.... it gives you that classic fps feel made by valve (the guys from steam). so the game involves everything steam has to offer. good examples would be the voice over ip, the integrated market system and etc. and with market system, i mean that you can actually earn money by the items you earn through the game :) the cons however would be the same as every other arena/competitive shooter.... although i must say, that the beta system in place called overwatch. somewhat involves the community in countering some of the cons.",2
"one of the best tactical shooter out there, that manages to kick you in the nuts while promising to give you a fancy knife.",2
