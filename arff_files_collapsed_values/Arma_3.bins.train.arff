"if you are looking for a more realistic experience from a first-person/third-person shooter, then this game is most definitely for you.",4
"the next generation arma awed reviewers with promising graphics and an intense single player campaign. what seemed like a would be goty quickly has faded away. as people slowly, possibly dreadfully make the switch to arma 3 they will see it is a myriad of misfortune. with very little solid content to speak of compared to its predecessor it has left people in want. the game has been an overall disappointment for me, with a lowered sense of viable large scale combat, and very little aircraft to be talked of i was sorely disappointed at bohemia interactives next generation game in the arma series. the only thing that has made it playable is the limitless community made mods to add things that the developers seemingly forgot from arma 2. this causes me to not recommend this game.",2
"pretty realistic game. but it sometimes takes 20-30 min to find an enemy to kill. but still fan.",1
"100% would recommend this game if your looking to get away from cod or battlefield for awhile great game to play by yourself or with some friends",1
"sad to see how far bohemia interactive has fallen. dont buy this b$#@ s%$@ or the dlc, all dlc should have been in the game in the first place! arma 2 had chinooks in the game, for free, they released cart racing dlc before helicopter dlc.... if you do own arma 3 already dont waste your money on dlc, the community will mod more helicopters/islands into the game for free then bis ever will. just wait dont waste your money. stay far away",2
"this is the best war simulator you can get,most of the players online take it very seriously and you can co-operate a lot with other players.the campaigin is pretty hard ,but killing an enemy feels very satisfieing.bohemia really keeps eveloping the game to make it more awesome.",1
"i realy like this game, iv been wanting a game like this for a while, its like the audio from dayz but beter and the graphics are on ultra and run perfect on my computer my favourites modes would be roleplaying in the arma 3 life its fun when your a cop mostly i like being an innocent and then smuggle guns throughout the world anyways 10/10 happy to have gotten this game for 39.99 aud it was only 29.99usd now its 59.99usd but anyways its still totaly worth it",1
"very good game. the mods you can get make it even better.",1
"if you enjoy playing battlefield and are looking for a good military game then this is for you. the only limitation is what you can imagine, as most things have been made by the amaxing modding community, and if you dont want to make your own missions then either play the best arma campaign ever! or just download one from the community.",2
"this game has improved graphics, ai, and voices over arma 2. however, it features made-up weapons with really bad sound effects. multiplayer servers are generally suckish, but occasionally you will find a good one. the real fun lies in the editor and missions by yourself and with friends, the customization offers limitless replayability with the right mods.",1
"eng: the most realistic war simulation game on steam, which just keeps getting better. referral! fin: realistisin sotasimulaatio peli steamissa, joka vain paranee. suositteluni!",1
"this game is epic. huge step up from arma 2. it still does have a lot of flaws but overall it is a much smoother game. however, low-end pcs beware. i am running an fx-6300 and a r9 280x and i consider it to be a pretty decent system. i can run most new games on near-max settings however this game on medium settings is giving me around 20fps. im not sure if its just very poorly optimized or what but it is sloooow.",1
"this game is awesome. a definite buy for anyone interested in realistic military simulations. theres a mod for almost anything annoying you may find in the game which is a huge plus. you can create and edit your own missions. it doesnt get much better than this. if your on the fence about buying it, do yourself a favor, and buy it now while its on sale.",1
"cant play multiplayer. many people has the same problem. i just bought this and it doesnt work.. just freezes when you try to look for servers.. money well spent !",1
"love this game play it alot and very often worth the money recommend.",3
"i am really good at this game come at me scubz lol feggets",1
"an amazing game even if you are not into war games there is always mods such as epoch and atlis life both are faboulesly amazing, buy this game!",3
"this is not a game, this is a simulation if anything. admittedly its not really war, and its not a good representation of the horrors of conflict, but its significantly better than call of dutys over romanticized grade 6 representation. as for worth, this is not a game you can really quantify. unlike many games where the campaign length or the multiplayer dictate its quality, this is much more than a game. if you played and liked arma 1, or 2, buy 3. and if youre thinking about buying arma 3, do it. the endless modibility, the mission creation and steam workshop, and the rich community are what make the arma series a true beauty. not to mention the multiplayer and campaign are kick .",3
"amazing game, really good graphics and there is lots to do online.",1
"this is a great game that really simulates what it is like to be in a real war. its single player is ok, but playing multiplayer in a group is what makes this game great.",5
"this is not a game. this is an simulator of you being in the military 10/10 would buy 100000 times",1
"complicated controlls but not that hard to learn. players friendly and helpfull to newcomers. extremely realistic and fun. its like a tactical, open world version of cod/bf. even more fun for players with existing knowledge of military tactics and jargon. would recommend arma 3 for fans of shooters like cod, cs, bf etc.",1
"must get game wont beleave how good it is and dont press g and get us all killed",1
"its really good i love it the community is great :d",1
"absolute garbage. complete alpha crap. buggy as all . 2/10",1
"arma iii is by far the best game there is (well until arma iv comes out). it is also probably the most difficult game to play as well. this game is all about tactics and working as a team (something missing from most first person shooters). the game is not about hopping around and making a kill ever 2 seconds like cod etc. the graphics look great and the maps are massive. a lot of games have a wall paper background this game is all 3d (even the clouds are modeled). that hill you see 3 miles away is a location you can travel to. this game does a great job of doing everything. check out the king of the hill rooms on team death match for fun multiplayer action.",2
"joined a match, jumped out of an airplane to darude - sandstorm. 10/10",1
"atmalarn zor olmasna ve pahal olmasna karn, her trl modlamaya ak, elenceli bir oyun. altis life, battle royale ok iyi. although combats are hard and expensive, it is open to modding and a fun game. altis life and battle royale is very good.",2
"fun game with tons of stuff to do! totally worth the money",1
"amazing game, infantry combat is great, helicopters are realistic (not dcs or take on helicopters realistic, but still amazing), vehicular combat is great, and take combat is amazing but again, like the helis, the tanks are not 100% realistic, but they are still great.",1
"a bit choppy and a little too complicated. the game overall is quite smartly laid out though, as each soldier in a squad will need some particular specialty in order to maintain the squads threshold against an opisition. after spending hours of entertainment in this game, watching the pretty graphics and npcs at work, i can say that the game is definately worth plating... at what cost though?...",1
"i cant say much about the games single player experience, since i havent really done a whole lot with that. what i can say is that in large scale co-op missions, you really see this game at its full potential. this is easily one of the best co-op experiences ive ever had, and ive been gaming since i was 3 years old.",2
"arma is the only place today where you can get a realistic military sandbox. there are bugs, glitches, animations, and vocals that are inherently arma, but that is not always a bad thing. sometimes the armaness can be quite entertaining. b.i. has, and had always stuck by their products with full support from updates, patches, and dlc. mods...thats a whole new world. there is fun that can be had in this game that you cant get anywhere else. yes, its hardcore and your fingers do the arma tango on the keyboard but its well worth the getting used to.",1
",          ,      ,   ,       ...         ? ,    5   ,   ,          ... !!!*spoiler alert*!!!        , ...      :3  ,  ,  ,      ,   - workshop. ,    ,    ,   ..    ,   ,     metal gear solid (    )  ...   ,       ,   ,  people hav, bohemia interactive  .      ,      :)",1
"its arma and thats what ruins this game. well ruin might be a strong word actually but thats not the point. the point is; whilst arma 3 is an enjoyable exeperience with its fancy guns and new physics, it really doesnt do anything to improve upon arma 2. i mean, theres plenty of new content and nice new graphics but it doesnt feel like much of an improvement in the way the game works. while i dont mind the action menu system i can see how it could be considered counter intuitive and that is the problem. the game has a learning curve that can make it difficult to enjoy and while i dont like games being dumbed down, i do enjoy them being made more accessible. the system used in arma is what puts a lot of players off and i dont think its particularly justifiable, as soon as bohemia change this they will see an increase in the playerbase. after that messy blab about the games system i do want to say i still wholeheartedly recommend the game, its great fun and worth a play.",1
"not a bad game per-se, but not worth the price tag, either. not by a long shot. buy it when its on sale or something.",1
"amazing! best game i have ever played! high quality.",2
"okay if you are getting the d3d error your graphics card cant handle it just buy a better one its completely worth it. best game ever.",5
"if you want a responsive, polished multiplayer experience, dont get this game. the engine is absolutely atrocious. even on low-pop servers (~25-30 players) with a 30ms ping, the game will desync, lag, the server will cause your client-side fps to plummet, etc. if youre fine playing an unresponsive, laggy, buggy mess, go for it.",1
"fantastic sim/game. learning curve is fairly small and incredably rewarding! if you like action games, blowing sh!t up, team work, driving, flying and diving! then this is probably the best game out there!",1
"a really freaking great game. the game is fun alone or with friends, and the modding community is great. i reccommend this to any fan of shooters or people who love a challenge",1
"this game beats all other shooters. although there are some things i wish this game had or didnt have, it still keeps me in suspense and excitement. i recommend this to anyone likes more realistic and serious, yet exciting games. right now, this is by far, my favorite game.",4
"arma 3 is a very fun, open world game. it has an extremely large modding community, and is widely played by those throughout the world. it contains a scenario editor in which you can create your own missions for you and/or others to play together. it has a unique scripting lanuage, which is difficult to learn at the beginning, but is very flexible once you learn it. the community has much variation, from player age, experience, heritage, etc. and is a great game for those who really like combat/strategy.",2
"the teamwork is great if you get the right people. a little sad how it performs with the amd cpus. +",1
"one of the best tactical shooters ive played since arma ii. :)",2
"yo g its just like cod but with vehicles so... best evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. but on a serious note it takes a pretty decent pc to run and its really fun if you play with friends",1
"got this game yesterday and im loving it! theres a variety of things you can do such as campaign, editor, multiplayer and lots of user made missions you can download to play!",4
"sweet game, better optimised that arma 2 in my opinion, the gun fights seem better on multiplayer but i personally enjoy arma 2 wasteland over arma 3 wasteland.",1
"this is for people with heavy expirance in this feild but if you have played for some time you will find this as a good refresh",1
"while i love the game, i cant think for the life of me why people think this is the best military simulator out there on the market today. arma 3 just feels like pointing a shooting, but every time i get into a gun fight in arma 2 adrenaline starts pumping through my body in real life. to each his own i guess, its probably because i have played past games. for a newcomer to the series, arma 3 is great. also, i have a gtx 690 and 24 gigs and a very good processor, and the game barely runs at 30 fps. but thats to be expected with a bohemia game, cant really be suprised by that. (edit) i have played 78 hours of this game, just on another computer.",1
"played it for 2 hours during the free weekend! it was amazing! i was speechless at the graphics of the terrain, they were simply unbelievable! i was playing it on my new laptop and i was running easily above 40fps!!! i wish i could buy it but sadly i got no money left from my laptop :( the people playing it we great and supportive. it was slightly harder to handle driving at first but after 20 minutes it was easy! if you are thinking about buying this game and have the money, dont think!!!!!! just buy it :d !!!",3
"i hated this game at first, i was not a big fan of arma it was so overwhelming. i finally sat down to give it a good ty and i have to say this gaem looks awesome and plays awesome. buy it.",2
"this is by far the best type of game i have seen. a good tutorial, a game mode to hone your skills on shooting and driving, a good story line if you wanna play 1player mode , an expansive multiplayer community, and the ability to design your own missions and stories.",4
"i highly reccommend this game! amazingly realistic and accurate, but tedious to play at times.",3
"best shooter i have ever played, its not like other fps games, less arcade style and leans more towards realism but aside from that, the world of arma is just simple amazing and beautiful, very well made terrain and cities/towns, you can lose your self just wandering around.",1
"the most complete fps simulation out yet ! its kind of complicate to understand all of its mech but when you do, you will have a really good time playing it. the plus to this game is definitely the dev mod tool and the community. 9/10",1
"a game about being a soilder who falls through the floor 10/10 would fall through floor again",1
"nothing beats popping a tire on a road sign and having to walk 10km to the nearest repair kit +1",4
"very fun, a big improvement in the arma series. that fatigue system though :p",1
"the reqirments are way too high and too good for my pc to handle",1
"i7/16g memory everything on low or turned off - max 20fps. nuff said.",1
"this game has terrible optimization.i am getting 15 fps in low graphics.",1
"cool game. good graphics. i run this better then a run arma 2.",1
"outstanding military simulator like its predecessor, but be warned of its poor optimization as it will bring even the best gaming rigs to its knees.",1
"unfortunatly, i was unable to play the multiplayer very well because of the horrible frame rate i was having... i would not recomend you buy this game if you dont have above average gaming pc",1
"very good game just need to fix bugs i recommend it to all",1
"biggest waste of money i ever made, i got it on sale and it was still a waste, waste of disk space, waste of time, a cheaper experience but all the same would be to rub dirt into your eyes till everythings brown then just walk around, eventually someone will put you out of your misery",1
"this is the biggest pile of crap i have ever played. looks like it was made in the 80s. very hard to control, and very slow game play. this is great if your going to be in the house for a month with nothing to do.",1
"great game, great mods. i still feel like it needs work, but its still tons of fun!",1
"best war game ever. its realism exceeds any expectations. it does have a very steep learning curve, so getting to be good in the game and actually like it might be a challenge. the best part is that it has room for more improvements, and out of its engine a lot of other games or mods can come out. its one of those games that can stick for you for years to come due to its complexity.",1
"wen plaein arma 4, remember to alwaes have ur gun in pokket, becorse enemies come tooo you, and shoot. u shoold shute back",2
"terriblly brought togther game, completely garabage engine that just sucks up all your cpu and ram for little to no graphics. net code is worse then battlefeild, this game should still be in alpha. everything is clunky and choppy, dosent run smoothly, this is something id expect from an indie game, not wroth 60$ not even worth 20$.",1
"never losses playability. so much to do! best game on steam! 10/10 will lead my friends in to combat again.",2
"arma is my go to game now, i love playing all the modes like altis life and battle royale. the game is a giant sandbox and is a ton of fun to play. i am trying to find a realism unit to play with because that looks like a lot of fun! i easily reccomend this game to anyone, a bit of a learning curve at first but its worth it. if you dont want to pay full price its totally worth it in a sale! after joining a military sim unit i feel like i am actually reaching this games full potential it is a lot of fun!i if you pick up this game look at joining a realism unit.",1
"military simulation at its best. if you want to try something different from arcade cod/bf, definitely give this a try.",1
"i have been banned for no reason! i warn everyone out there that if you buy this game, keep a safe and protected account!",1
"great game, but bis failure to optimise their arma engine disappoints the majority of the community. ea was able to run bf4 on a tablet, perhaps they should learn for them.",3
"this is the real military simulation game. 101/100 nothing much to say just play it and you know what i mean.",1
"walked for so long i was expecting 13 dwarves to show and ask me to take them to the lonely mountain. got to shoot a rabbit. my feet hurt/10",1
"this is just one of those games you just need to own you will love and hate all the bugs in the game but stupid part is that is what makes it so good. highly recomended",1
"very much a hardcore shooter, and probably closest to a real combat simulator you are likely to find easily on steam. its not easy but if you put in the time to wrap your head around it, its a really good shooter. vehicle integration is great as well. community maps and scenarios are quickly becoming a high quality alternative to the single player campaign.",1
"this is the most buggy game i have ever played in my life. i had all settings turned down to low so that i could work my way up to see what settings i could use comfortably but once i turned shadows on all the characters and guns went multicoloured and it put the fps down from 60fps to 1fps.",1
"definitely a unique title like nothing else. 9/10 worth it!",1
"great game, love playing it. awesome communities to meet new people and play with your friends. 10/10",3
"great game without mods. even better with mods! my favorite mods are tfar and acre!",5
"a very fun and addicting game, the action and all the fire fights that happen make this game very intense. there is mulitple things you can do on the mulitplayer, such as playing with a team to eliminate certain places. the muliplayer makes the game a lot better.",1
"well if you like cod then gtfo cuz this is arma 3, by far the best game i have ever play (with dota 2 in close second). it is a must have and is #dope",2
"its a very fun game, but what i hate about is there is a lot of problems. very bad game if you dont have a good cpu.",1
"this is what battlefield 3 should have been before ea got thier nasty little hands on it. this game is as close to the military as your gonna get without giving up your life for 4 or so years (at least from a civilians point of view). enough content to cover land, sea, and air. and gives you way to many options to play the way you want to play (for example. i play intel style). worth buying.",1
"the game where you can literally mod anything into it!",2
"in a game all about war, surprisingly you dont get much action unless your in a tank or in singleplayer. the best moment ive ever had with this game is where your about to evac and your helecopter gets shot down, and you and the survivors with no comucation to hq have to walk 10km while carrying a dead body of your comrade all the way back to the spawn. just walking and talking with your fellow soldiers. 8/10 ~agreenarrow",1
"its a great game for the player who likes realism, multiplayer, and sandbox games in one deal. by far the best military game ive played. 10/10",3
"its boring and you wont know what to do switching back to call of duty s",1
"i recommend this game to the max. i bought it full price then 3 weeks later it is on sale so im pissed about that but overall it is a very good very well made game.",1
"amazing visuals considering the amount of playable area, if you have a serious rig, it is worth it to try to max this game and drive as for miles. navigation, ballistics, survival are all highly realistic in this game and require legitimate knowledge of real world miliatary procedures. this game will actually teach you about; firing postions, compatible blood types, orienteering, munitions, recognising camoflages and identifying their affiliation. so much more with user created content. endless fun that never stops impressing.",1
"i have no words. boheimia interactive has done it again, this time on an even grander and more immersive scale than the last. alone, this game is amazing. with friends, this game is amazing. with food, this game is amazing. masturbating, it is amazing. did i mention that its amazing?",2
"arma three is one hell of a joyride, in this action pack- just ing buy the game and play it for yourself!",2
"if your an arma fan this game wont dissapoint. its not fps in the sense that you dont have a health bar ect, one shot can kill you if placed right. this makes for using tactics all the more important. you dont just charge into a fight guns blazing, instead you tend to plan your approach and put alot more effort into each scenario. this is a true combat simulator and the best ive played of the arma series so far.",1
"omg is this real life? it has got to be the best military sandbox i ever seen. so realistic having a blast with it.",1
"amazing. now with more fps the game is running smoothly and is actually playable now. in the past.. you need a hell of a computer. i recommend it now.",4
"amazing game play, highly recommended if you enjoyed arma 2",2
"holy  this game has more bugs and errors than windows 2000",2
"realy good game, lots of gamemodes and lots of rp servers. the downside of the game is that it has fps problems, but some times it not the game but the gamemode if you play a 70 player rp server then yeah the fps sucks but if you play a deathmatch with 20 player (like battle royal,its a mod ) its not that bad. and it has a lot of nice workshop content. 10/10 would like to kill some one again !",3
"this game is amazing its like 6 or 7 games in one....with all the mods you can play with this game makes this game so worth the money....never have i played a rp shooter but its so epic",4
"good game but with all the extra  steam does with batteleye its not worth it, atleast not for $60.00. youll get failed ticket, or corrupt data every 20 minutes or so.",2
"i recommend this game,but now have litlebit bugs is force close i dont know it close just fix it i will happy.",1
"one of the most realistic shooters i have ever played. if you love games where action is at every turn and everything is tramatic , this is not for you. this game is about patience and time, waiting for the right time to strike and getting into position for the battle. once you are in battle, things change and you have to adapt to them. great game 10/10.",2
"pretty fun with a few friends. can be hard to get into at first and understand the layout of different game modes but once you do it becomes competitive, fun and thrilling. being a veteran of arma 2 crossing into arma 3 as well as its friendly dayz counterparts, id suggest this game to mates anytime.",1
"piece of  broken game! would have recommended it but game is broke for me at the moral fiber mission. i want all my time wasted back. absolute overprice peice of mut",1
"this review is more for australians than anyone else. sorry but the game just isnt ing fun for me, you really have to invest yourself wayyyyyyyyy too much into it to even remotely have an experience. and i have played the previous arma games so fight me. you know that a game has issues when everytime you boot it up you have to spend 10 minutes remembering the controls. sure american youtubers make this look so fun but if youre australian prepare yourself for a whopping 3 whole servers to play on. holy  dude thats insane lets see what we have. wasteland, a life server thats always full and some locked server. woooooow. but yeah real talk none of those leave a good first impression to a new player who cant even figure out how to teamspeak to get help. yes to someone who knows how to play this game is a fun  thing. but so many people who buy this game will probably play it once, think its boring, and then just uninstall it. and if that isnt a failure for the developers then all they care about is the money theyll get from these said people and thats just ing wrong. i give the game 8/10 for the best moments in it. and for the average experience a 4/10. dont buy this game if you dont know what youre getting yourself into.",1
"excellent graphics and fantastic team play. if you want a game that is realistic and fast paced then this is the one for you. there are also chances to go solo in several multiplayer servers if thats your style!",3
"most realistic military simulation game ive ever played.",1
"you can kill people without knowing anything about them and you still do it because youre a mother ing american",1
"boom pow boom bug bug bug boom pow bugs glitches boom pow",1
"pretty sure this is one of the best games i have ever played. let me tell a story: i was on a server and i was a medic on a medivac helicopter, and my pilot and i get a call asking for a medivac beacuse they lost 2/4 of there men, so we dust off and go to help them but half way there the remainding men got knocked down so what do me and my pilot do? we go through with the plan anyways, so while under heavy fire and are heli has no guns, we land and i drag all 4 bodies back to the helicopter and then we fly off i do first aid back at the base and patch them and then we fly them to there next objective to take down a enemy mortar squad who was giving our main force a beating. just 1 of the many stories i have of arma 3",4
"full of vast scenery and realistic vehicles and weapons, arma 3 is a great open world tactical shooter. it is graphics hungry and even my 7970 struggles to run it well (although i havent taken to fine tuning the settings yet). the campaign was added after the release (which is weird) but its good and it helps the player in remembering the locations on the gigantic maps (like seriously stratis and altis are huge). combat is realistic (as far as i can tell), rp servers exist, coop is fluid, all in all a great game.",1
"i had a life. then i downloaded arma 3. havent seen the daylight for 3 months.",1
"awesome game played 50hr in the last week really recomend getting it",1
"bought this for the altis life mod. seriously, all of my 180 hours have been on altis life.",2
"this game is very entertaining altis life is just so much fun",2
"do you have a monster computer? then i would suggest checking this out because it is an amazing game. dont have one? then this is the laggiest pos you will ever play. they didnt really bother on the whole optimization thing, i guess its too mainstream to optimize your game. im running a phenom quad core @ 2.8ghz, 8gb ram, and a radeon 7770 and i have to put this game on dead low settings just to make it even possible to play. that is just ing ridiculous, when these specs allow me to play any other game at high settings. i loved arma 2 and arma 3 improves on the series so much but the amount of power it takes to get into a decent size game just is not worth its price tag.",1
"i like it alot and recommend it for all its an realy realisick game youl all love it its almoust like day enjoy",1
"a very very good dude shooter with things that only can happen in arma. 11/10 its kind of the bomb.",3
"in my opionion i prefer arma 2 op arrowhead, however this game is more customizable with your character (always a good thing) and it is definatle more pretty than a2. if your into the growing futuristic modern warfare games, this is a great one!",1
"too difficult? its just too realistic. with the development both by bi studio and the arma community, the arma series is definity the most versatile military simulator for the moment. with great improvement in graphic quality and the ability to port arma and arma 2 into armaiii, arma iii has brought the arma series into a next level.",1
"loved it, after the success of cooking mama and league of legends the developer activision shines down on us with the masterpiece that is this game (gears of halo thef auto 5) and with its staggering 69 dlc packs all priced at $4.20 youd be a fool not to try this game out. insomniac games really outdid themselves on this one. 8/6 would eat without package.",2
"i dont have much of a game time in this game yet, but from what ive played and from what ive seen... its by far one of the best games i have played, its a massive open world army simulation kind of game, youre not being given anything like the enemy being highlighted ect, you have to use your eyes and ears and watch your every step... 8/10 maybe a couple of improvements can be made, but its deffo one of the best games i have played and id reccomend it to anyone with a bit of patience as its not as fast paced like games such as call of duty ect",1
"this game is not worth anywhere close to 60 bucks. though there are some nice updates from arma 2 the same issues still plague this series principally the third person camera. every multiplayer server that is populated allow third person, and the gameplay experience revolves around hiding behind a wall until someone else moves into the open before shooting him. its terrible.",1
"the game has many issues, even with the bi saying it is a finished game, still a wip, needs optimization, fixing some animations and other problems that causes impact in performance and gameplay, but overall it is a great game, and you can certainly pick somethings up as tactics if youre interested in that, it is a civilian reduced version of a military simulator",1
"the base game is pretty darn good but it gets way better with mods!",1
"havent a clue about the military play cod you want realism, beautiful world and a  tone of  to do get arma",4
"one of my most favorite games of all time, from the bad  graphics and the tactical realism, this game is a must have for those who enjoy the tactical side of gun play. two words to describe this..... bad",4
"very good game just need to fix bugs i recommend it to all",1
"i personally think that this is a love or hate kind of a game, and i hate it, more specifically how it controls. yeah it looks great but if i cant enjoy the way the character behaves i wont enjoy the game. its just too clumsy in my opinion. if you dont like arma 2 then you wont like this one.",1
"question to the game makers: if i bought the lim addion, should i have all the dlc?",1
"very good game highly recommend :nato: :nato: :nato: :nato: :nato:",1
"pretty neat and fun, simply badly optimized and the controls are a little difficult to get used to.",1
"if you want to play the best military simulator experience, arma 3 is your best bet. it has the combat, vehicles, weapons, it has it all. i have played arma 3 for around 300 hours and it is still fun. there are a variety of different game modes that you can play: such as wasteland, which is less serious than others; life servers are for the ones who probably played a lot of darkrp in garrys mod; insurgency and domination, they are also good tactically played gamemodes which are sometimes taken a lot seriously. this game gives the feel that you are the soldier. you are the pilot in that a-164 wipeout. you are the commander of that hunter gmg. survive. adapt. win. lovely game, 10/10.",3
"amazing game with a huge community behind it. new mods all the time to add new flair to the game. mods soch as breaking point, king of the hill, and acre radios, and more. all this gives into a game that ever changing and once its paid for, all content is free",3
"fun game, though the combat system takes time getting used to.",1
"this game will not measure your kdr, this game will not have you grind to unlock weapons or attachments, this game will not release 4 expensive dlc patches every year, but this game will be more immersive, epic and thrilling than any other. it will make you feel like a part of something bigger. arma is not for everyone, one should not be fooled into thinking so; the willingness to train, practice and execute are not traits everyone posses. however, should you choose to don the desert camo of blufor, the quicksand colours of opfor or the grass greens of greenfor, know that you have become part of a community which will grow, advance and perfect their craft. if youre willing, and if you want more than a game, arma is the pinnacle of milsims to date. update: the new zeus game modes are amazing (currently availible on the dev build), it is difficult to sum up the essence of the gane mode, but it is very interesting, and my new favourite game mode, which is quite an achievement considering ive been around since arma: cold war crisis (as it is bow known) and the opf games.",4
"great game with an insane amount of re-playability! super user-friendly, especially if youve played arma 2 for some time, as most things are identical (controls wise). some great mods to play, nice engine, decent fps and vac and trackir supported! if youre looking for a great combat simulator or just want a fun sandbox game to mess around on, then arma 3 is the game for you!",5
"this is a good game for anyone into great strategic gameplay and/or shooters that dont overuse features that might have been good in previous games but get boring over time, with realistic physics, and have a sense of realism about their campaign. the arma series also features at least one huge, open island in each game, each island is based of a real life location and is geographically accurate to said location. also, in multiplayer matches, youre movement is only limiteded by the the hosts decisions on objective placement or spawn placement. another neat feature is that in the campaign, you arent forced into a small open area to move, you are allowed to move wherever and whenever you see fit and youre only limited by the occasional time limits to get to a certain location before something bad happens.",2
"i launched a beachead with fighters and stuff it was cool",1
"buggy as hell, dlc is basically updates that should have been included in the game for free ? what the hell bohemia, i was excited for arma 3 to be released as i thoroughly enjoyed arma 2 oa when arma 3 was relelase i was very disapointed i dont think ill be buying another bohemia game due to the amount you ed your customers around.",4
"complex but fun especially if you have friends to play with. - i didnt like it in the beginning i found it rigid and complex, mainly because i was comparing it to the other fps games in the market + very good gameplay + fancy graphics and physics are good + huge community contribution - you will walk a lot and you will be lost in the beginning i recommend it :)",1
"they need to work on there servers, hackers are taking over the servers and changing stuff, so they really need to work on that, other then that its my favorite game.",1
"beautiful game. only downside is that actually shooting people isnt really all that enjoyable. people have a mini-seizure everytime they get shot then ragdoll.",1
"absolutely fantastic and never played before game. this game is a beast! i recommend this game with 9/10 stars",1
"cant tell you if you should buy it or not, but i can tell you this. you will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have. but when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, its something magical you just cant find in any other game. arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. you buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. arma is a game which you can never called finished. there will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! ill give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back. read: i will not accept random friend requests! if you have a question, please post it in the comments.",5
"amazing game well worth the money, doesnt get boring with the amount of endless funny stuff to do, alot of mods and customization for game modes",3
"dont join german servers. they will arrest you for ing looking suspiceous. other than that, 10/10",1
"nice game with all mod,this game is very realistic and a complete team game.",1
"if you liked arma 2 you will like this game. if you havnt played an arma game, i would definatly recomend watching a few videos to see what its like. personally i would give it a 9/10.",1
"iam in love...altis life....love it even more then dayz :o",1
"this is not a game, this is a simulation if anything. admittedly its not really war, and its not a good representation of the horrors of conflict, but its significantly better than call of dutys over romanticized grade 6 representation. as for worth, this is not a game you can really quantify. unlike many games where the campaign length or the multiplayer dictate its quality, this is much more than a game. if you played and liked arma 1, or 2, buy 3. and if youre thinking about buying arma 3, do it. the endless modibility, the mission creation and steam workshop, and the rich community are what make the arma series a true beauty. not to mention the multiplayer and campaign are kick .",3
"buggy and not even worth the discounted price. i wish i could get a refund.",1
"this joint off the chain. it looks sexy and i find it satisfying to play. if you liked arma 2, this is much more fluid and streamlined. it takes time to figure out all the keys cus theres so many, but its because of that which gives this game a unique experience of control and realism. now that i think about it moving your head independant of your gun doesnt really do much but it feels baller. on top of all that theres a never ending stream of content on the workshop. theres even a metal gear solid remake.",1
"this is one of the best , if not the best mil-som games out there. this is the latest of the arma titles. you can even make the game better by using free mods that you can get from the steam work shop or online.",1
"an epic, realistic army simulator! this game is incredibly amazing and stunning as you are playing a role in the army. unlike any other shooter/army games, arma manage to give the player a open-world battlefield. the map is very big, there are a massive range of weapons, outfits, vehicles, helicopters, boats and planes. problems: if you are thinking about buying this game, please be careful, when i bought the game, it shocked me when the game ran at 10 fps at low settings, i had to buy a complete new graphics card in order for it to at least run above 40 fps in medium/high settings.",2
"this game is absolutely fantastic. it really shows how bogus cods and mws claims of realism are. i would recommend this game to anyone who is sick of the spunkgargleweewee that the modern shooter has turned into. i would not recommend this game to anyone who lacks patience, because, like real life combat, there are many times that you arent shooting at someone, but are instead using tactics and stratagies involving the tarrain to get the advantage.",1
"arma 3 is a miltary simulator through and through, but unlike most simulators arma 3 has a campaign with in-depth story to boot and competitive mp thats more then decent. the ai is of a standard above what most games have to offer out there and each weapon, ground or aireal vehicle strive to give as realistic experience as can do when operating said equipment. weapons need to be zeroised and as per actual warfair artillery or mortars need to be given a grid reference (gr) before effective fire can be achieved; and you yourself can operate fire support weapons. the campaign is set into episodes and each episode has just below ten missions that offer a challenge in every aspect. although your ai teammates need to be babysitted somewhat and the game could use some more optimisation but thats a small price to pay in a game that is overall great. i score this game a 8.5/10.",1
"i enjoy arma 3 most realistic military simulater i have played.",1
"okay this game is amazing and pretty as crysis, if not, more pretty, the detail put into this game is beond imagination, its fantastic, and the game is really good, but it is a miltary sim, and not like battlefeild, its pretty much one bullet in the right spot and youre done, so you have to be patent, and to conlude this review im going to tell you the only ture con of this game, this game requires a gaming setup, it is very cpu heavy i suggest having an i7, and a good one at that, the gpu is pretty standerd requirments on this game but have a good cpu, and this game is very fun",1
"single player is good and runs pretty well, but the multiplayer is the most laggy thing in the world. i dont know why, i pass the recommended requirements. so this is why i would not recommend it.",1
"ratings: graphics: 9/10 sound: 9/10 content: 5/10 singleplayer: 7/10 multiplayer: 9/10 workshop: 10/10 diversity: 8/10 arma 3 is a great military simulation, that lets you feel how war could feel like. not seeing your enemy but getting shot at is almost everyday business, like it is if you are deployed in real life war zones. the game mechanics are far more advanced than in arma 2, however, the game still lacks content. although arma 2 didnt have content at the beginning, it still bothers myself a little bit. the sound and graphical elements are magnificient and the world offers a lot of nice landscapes. however i would recommend playing it as a multiplayer game, if you can try to play with some friends. i hope i could help you with my review. please note that this is my personal view, i will upgrade this review if further content is added lateron.",1
"got in a game of stratis wasteland, joined up with some bluefor, lagged out so much that trucks were spazing in and out of the time-space continuum. took one step forward and then died. 1000000000000000000000000000/10 would lag again.",1
"i am hiding behind a rock , the bullets richohet on the rocks top and hit the grass behind me. its a foggy day so i cant see much , puting my head out would kill me. i need to work out were the enemie is shooting me from befor they can flank me. so i observe the impact on the grass behind me , i can barly work out based on the impact of bullets from what direction they are firing. i peak out shoot about 10 burst in there direction and toss a grenade. i go back to hiding and crawl behind a tree that was near the rock. i can hear or see the enemie but i dont know if i killed them. so i slowly walk in a half sercle around the grenade impact. i see that they both went to were i was last. i aim , shoot and kill them both. non of this was a scriptied event it just happened. armaiii , like all arma games is a military sim that depends on both the devs and moders to give you the best military simulation out there.",2
"this game will live long. if you like military shooters, military simulators, civilian simulators, shooters, sandbox style, and a game that has a great community which is still expanding, then you will love this game.",1
"great graphics, great multiplayer, and great community! what more is there to ask for?",4
"game crashes a lot but its fun. stop crashing pls.",1
"as i was walking through the woods after  went to hell thinking we were finally safe, my team leader stepped on a landmine and exploded before my eyes. someone over the radio said jesus are you alright? are you hurt?. my character replied yeah - i mean no, yes im fine before immediately stepping on a landmine and exploding. ive only been playing this game for an hour, but im already hooked. definitely worth it. just hope i can figure out how to read a map.",1
"the ai is still no help. its far away behind the group or is not able to hit targets... why cant this be fixed?! for mp only its very good but the campaign and ai sucks hard!",1
"such a beautiful game, excellent realism and tactical combat, you truly feel immersed in a real war.... however arma 3 has major failings, firstly it is poorly optimised, runs on only a couple of threads, meaning the newer your pc, the slower the game will run. the review pc was a piledriver 4.5ghz 8-core amd with a 680gtx card, ultra high settings the game had the same frame rate as low settings - averaging between 18 - 30fps, which was jerky but playable, until you got somewhere where a tank rolled in behind us and started shoooting, then everyone there was down to 3fps. people say there pc runs fine, but half the people i know who play are barely able to move and shoot, until arma 3 is fixed and written properly to support modern hardward, you should not buy this game. the developers have never managed to fix arma 2, i hold little hope they will fix arma 3!",1
"im glad i could play arma 3 for free on this last weekend, thus preventing me from buying it, ever. every game should give buyers this option, to try before buying. while arma 3 may be a good game, im sure now that its not for me. i have been playing bf for a long time, even bf4 now, and i think bf spoiled me. i really tried enjoying arma 3, but i couldnt. in my humble opinion: bad graphics, bad optimization, bad performance, bad gameplay, bad controls, bad hud, bad voip, bad campaign and bad multiplayer. ive spent nearly one hour on multiplayer driving a truck around the map, trying to figure what to do, how to get a weapon and where were my team mates. before that i tried campaign, with no satisfaction either. its is an expensive game. im really glad i didnt bought it.",1
"amazing game, totally worth getting graphics 10/10 multiplayer 10/10 campaign not finished/10 dayz,altislife,wasteland etc mods 10/10",1
"it is arma, it is not for anyone, but it is an experience unlike any other",1
"arma 3 is a great advancement from arma 2, it still holds the fun aspects of gameplay but comes with bigger, better more modern equipment and rifles. also it comes with a wide range of aircraft including remote control drones, i would recommend this game to anyone wanting to have fun for a good price as there is many different types of severs.",2
"this game right here made me pregnant, and i am a guy.",1
"arma 3 is a very fun game to mess about on but it is quite hard to play seriosly as the ai are absolute  and becuase crashing into a fence at 2 kmh in a car kills you. apart from this it is a very fun game to play on altis life but i wouldnt really recommend it that much who actually want to do millitary stuff on it.",3
"this is not your typical shooter, it is more of a simulation game with firefights usually at football feild lengths away unlike the close quarter battles in cod or moh. this is not a shooter with tightly scripted fights and cynimatic bravado, it is a sandbox game in the truest sense of the word especially with the games support of the mod community. if you have basic scripting knowledge or patience then the game opens new possibilities with the fantasic mission editor that alows you to set up single and multiplayer firefights in minutes. lastly the multiplayer is fun though i find multiplayer is better at a smaller scale with friends on custom missions though if you can get into a warefare game it is a lot of fun playing a large scale realistic rts/fps.",1
"as i love to see games that have the great feeling of realism, this game brings me the most joy. it has some great weapon physics, hit-boxes, ragdoll and all the other types of mechanics. the mods to arma 3 are great like altis life, breaking point, battle royale and others. like i said, this game is really nice if you like simulators of this kind, and if you dont, go back to call of duty ;) <3 ~sadguy",1
"arma... that is a soldier and one life, lots of helicopters, tanks and other things",1
"if not for the horrendous ai that plagues arma titles, this would be a great game. the ai makes it impossible to really enjoy. they are absolutely inept when given orders: completely refusing to respond to orders most of the time or attack hostiles accurately when on your team. though the ai manages to have 360 degree aimbots when you personally face them and have no issues navigating obstacles: only when faced against you.",1
"drove 10 minutes to get to the objective, i hit a tree and my atv broke. had to run for 20 minutes to the obj. and got immediatly shot. 10/10",1
"ran than jumped off a stone wall than flew like supa man than flew to my death 11/10 best game na",1
"would be better if i could actually play the game for more than 20 minutes.... but no.",1
"they make you buy the game for $60 then they global bann because you hacked, but i never even downloaded anything for this game to even tey to hack it, and tell you that you have to buy the game again to play online and they cant unban you i strongly do not recommend this game because of its fraud factor.",1
"awesome graphics and plot but games playability is very low. controls are very hard to use. you can not change them in the way you choose. it is the worst game i ever played for 4-5 years. really annoying just because of controls. there are universal keys like t for chat or y for team chat, they are totally different. and another problem is that bohemia uses the same strategy for their other products like dayz. another not recommended game for me.",1
"totally worth the 45 euros. its an incredible game with or without friends..you can have so much fun and never get bored...you could choose any mod and altis life is amazing. the bad thing is the performance from the servers...they are really bad. you cant play with 60 fps...doesnt matter what setup you have. anyways, i think its still pretty good...buy it!",2
"one of the best and most realistic modern shooters out there. great online content and community. good campaign. amazing graphics. well worth the money if youre looking for an open world, modern shooter.",1
"have a decent pc? buy it! have a pc that can only run minecraft at low settings? just dont... or youll have a real bad time.",1
"damn good isnt it, beside the horrible fps issues.",2
"played altis life rpg for eight hours straight. made my first million. bought a chopper, and fully geared myself up. died in a fiery crash when the cops told me i couldnt land in a meth lab. lost all my money and had to start from square one. 10/10 ign",1
"its a great game, i mostly like the rpg mods but thats just me, what do you think?",1
"cant get english dont wast you hard earned money game sucks very bad",1
"only ever played the wasteland mod. its harsh and fun.",2
"a game in which almost always when you die it is the games fault. broken  piece of  in which you have to scroll through menus to do  which is very convenient when in the middle of a firefight, almost revolutionary id say. a simulator where the cars explode(!) when you crash it into anything. this is a game made by devs who have never played any modern games and take all their inspiration from their own past games and the only one that they made that was considered modern was the original operation flashpoint back in 1998 or something. all their games past that have imitated that game and arma 3 design is still based on that game (read: doesnt work very well anymore, or never really did) if it still isnt very obvious this is a rage post. ive played the game for over 100 hours for some reason and i continue to play it but im still convinced that 10 hours in bohemias office and i could fix the design of this game.",1
"you can make huge battles with tanks and helicopters! 10/10",1
"one of the best games ive ever played 10/8 gg ez game",2
"awesome game, loads of scope and community content. this game actually does have epic online battles if you know where to look!!",2
"buyed arma 3, got an oragsm , ten minutes later i found out that it has dlc for 15 euros, had a seizure. 10/10 would milk money like cod and battlefield again!",1
"i bought this game and even till now i dont know how to use it idk wut i will do in multiplayer idk how to put things in inventory and how to respawn in a server last time i joined a server it was horriable it says you are dead wait a medic or wait to respawn ... then i waited and waited 15 min nothhing happens wtf ... why dont hey put a simple game that you can understand like bf4 cod ghosts or gta 5 ...",1
"a great game especially altis life where you can be a poor homeless man or a rich drug lord, also tons of fun mods to play 10/10 would buy",1
"brilliant military simulator, much better buy than other similar fps games. both campaign and multiplayer are diverse and immersive! f*** the aaf also...",1
"there shouldnt be any in game purchases. this is how companies loose trust in their customers cause you turn around and screw us by trying to make a cheap buck. go f**k yourself bohemia!! you cheap  m*therf**kers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"man, is like life, but with better graphics and a exelent background history :v :v :v",3
"although it may still only be in a disguised beta sort of stage,its still immensly fun when you hop onto a multiplayer server (try invade and annex which is what im referencing here) hop into a formed up squad and clear aos with the help of coordinated allies. zeus is also incredibly fun if youre into dropping people into s**t storms. the ability to basically create your own batles is a very fun concept indeed. workshop intergration allows mission creators publish their stuff easier and more people have more acess to it. if you want to buy it or not, i dont mind but you definetly keep your eyes on arma if incase something makes you just suddenly get the urge to buy it (like many, many mods) and i hope to see you on the field.",4
"i have to say, havent played much, but i would recomend this game to everyone, you have to see the huge amount of things that this game offers to you, its beautifull.",1
"enough with arcadey nonsense. this is realistic combat simulator. mods are fun.",1
"can recomend this game if not for just the game then for the mods that the community make for it. the community is what makes the arma games what they are.",1
"how do i have the option to write a review. when i dont even own this game ???",1
"yo bro this game is kool dude i was stunned when colonel dickbutt came over the radio and he was like yo  get to the objective i was like wow this game is so realistic and cool but then i remembered its on the arma engine so i quit",1
"after playing from operation flashpoint through the series to arma 3, i can say that arma 3 is the best yet in the series :)",1
"if you like playing with 15 fps this game is for you.",1
"yea if you are a guy who plays call of duty or some games then this game is not for you becuse it is tacktickal and you die wery fast but when you learn the controls and the game then... it fun and i recomend it for the person who can toloreit death and to colect your stuff and check out my channel pls",1
"everything about this game improves on arma ii except for one key point. the game simply does not run. not on high end machines, not on anything, it is so poorly optimised and coded that no system can run it smoothly (60 fps). online games lag all the way down to 10-15 fps in cities just because the server code is poorly written and results in server side lag that effects frame rate as well as hit detection. if this game was actually able to run at a decent frame rate that stayed decent online it would be a wonderful game. until that time i cannot recommend this game.",1
"10/10 pros: guns greece gunns good maps awesome rp mod(s) cons: no shotguns kavala is lag city no other cons",1

"after 10++ hours in this game, you will realize that shooting a real gun is far more simple than killing an ai in this game",1
"this is one of the all time great games. it is a beautiful open world sandbox with so much content it is almost limitless what is possible. highly recommend.",2
"very good game with alot of mods that you can play with yourself and friends!",2

"why are you still here? just to laugh? every night, i can feel arma... guns... even bf2... the fun ive lost... the games ive lost... it wont stop hurting... its like theyre all still there. you feel it, too, dont you?",1
"the only game ive purchased in my entire life that i regret buying. look at more reviews to find out if this game is for you or not. it appeals to many, but not to all. do your research and dont end up a shmuck like me.",1
"the best war simulator game that i have ever seen, arma 3 is a simulator game that has series and dlcs all around this game. i recommend buying this game when you have played the arma series. arma 3 has a mod that is comming out that is called day z where players have to survive in a world full of zombies and bandits. you can find loot, fight zombies, find vehicles and mostly. fighting bandits. you can trust anyone, but they cant trust you... - stevenisadork",1
"a game where walls are just for show and you can walk right through em,a game where ifrits are unbreakable no matter the height, a game where you can fuken get thrown out of a c130 and ram into the ground and live great game",1
"i only played this game for 2 days but enjoyed every bit of it! i dont think it is worth 60 dollars. id rather spend 60 dollars on something else",1
"i think this is the best pc game. honestly, there are so many mods. from wasteland, to breaking point, to, epoch/overpoch, to altis life, arma 3 life, battle royale, military simulation, and so much more. trust me, it is well worth your 60 dollars and will keep you entertained for a very long time. if you can get past the horrible optimisation, and get by with whatever fps you get trust me this game will keep you entertained. 10/10 would play again.",1
"optimization. lags everywhere.  gameplay. gay as . laggy as . inconsistant. boring. dont waste. call of duty is better.",1
"this game has even more potential than it has, this offers all kinds of modes for different types of players. arma 3 is the best shooting/interactive game in quite a long time. keep up the good work!",3
"this is definately the game to buy if youre playing with your buddies and you walk for an hour to meet up and then they randomly get shot while you sit back and die of laughter from them raging and then realize you have to find eachother on wasteland again. 11/10 would play again.",1
"kinda like warcraft 3 no one buys it for the actual game its all about the mods.",1
"really good game. heaps of mods and game modes comming out all the time. this game is a great investment for the future and i think everyone should have it in there steam library.",3
"arma 3 on its own is not something that unique and great but if you try some of the mods out there such as altis life youre gonna freaking love it.worth every penny.",3
"my hours on record should speak for the game itself, its only in beta and already is such a fun game, sure the ai are a little buggy but wasteland, coop, hell even just playing helicopter tag is fun. its a sandbox game so you can spawn in stuff in the editor and create a mission and then play it however you want to. one of the greats of our generation going beyond anything call of duty, battle field, halo have done or probably will do i highly recommend this game.",2
"as a man who use to be in the military and have been in combat, this game really is the real deal. its 10x better than arma 2.",2
"the game that i use most my hours on. this game is all about community. and the community is stronger than ever! recommende for everyone that need a little advance warfare with a bigger dose of reality and community than codbf can offer!",1
"awesome game, its a great army simulator. ive spent 71 hours on arma 3 and counting. good job devs!",1
"anyone who has not played this game i feel bad for you sandbox mode is amazing",1
"this is the game ive been waiting for. everything i loved about arma 2 with hugely improved engine and animations and unlimited potential for unique missions and gameplay. i got arma 2 for dayz, but i got arma 3 for arma! best. game. ever... :)",1
"i truely love this game, i have a clan in it that we all play and do missions and a lot of other things on the side. this game has its issues such as animation and its ai can be stupid. but it can be a challage and i find challages very fun. this game does need more weapons and vehicles in my opinion but all around its a great game to play with your buddies.",4
"one the best games ever, years of selfmaking content :)",1
"arma 3 is a great game! it has some really nice grapics and is better optimised that arma 2",2
"simply amazing. fun to play insurgency and king of the hill",2
"one of the best shooters next to tf2 i have ever played!",1
"brillant, keeps updating and never gets old, easy to mod",4
"this is by far the best type of game i have seen. a good tutorial, a game mode to hone your skills on shooting and driving, a good story line if you wanna play 1player mode , an expansive multiplayer community, and the ability to design your own missions and stories.",4
"i like the game when it was on free weekend, the campagin dialog is amazing but the guns i had were hard to zero and wouldnt shoot where i pointed but still thumbs up.",1
"the campain is a major improvement compared to the missions from arma 2. also the overwhelming support from the mission and modding community adds seemingly endless posibilities for gameplay.",3

"for an older game it is actually really well done. i like it a lot. wish i had bought it sooner.",3
"just buy the f**king game already. if you need to read reviews your ready to perchase.",2
"very good game but needs a queue to join for muiltiplayer so you dont just sit thier spamming the join button to servers",3
"this game is full of action, even when commanding.",5
"love it. playing with the duws scenario makes for a lot of fun. good graphics, challenging ai. and sometimes the glitches are amazingly funny :d",1
"its a military sandbox with semi-realistic elements but poorly optimised.",1
"i was walking down the road ied dead  yeah my legs. win. 12/10",2
"this game is one of the rare game that has always something new, the community is big and has a lot of modders. you will always find something to do, but i warn you it doesnt run smoothly often and for me this is the only problem. i hope you will consider buying it if you are looking to play for tones of hours and fun! see you on arma!",3
"yes i like the weekend thing but can u atleast let it be every wekend plz",1
"fun game. really fun for mucking around or just surviving online. huge map. great with mods (zombie survival mods such as zoombies). must play shooter.",1
"amazing, forget my old review. this game is gold. as a arma lover, i was super hyped about the game. the reason i hated the game was because i only played watseland and altis life. but i joined the more war servers. and damn its fun.",1
"game is amazing! definetely recommend it to anyone into shooter games although there is a lot of other cool things to do in the game, along with all the fun multiplayer lobbies. makes this game a ton of fun! rated 10/10.",2
"got it in the alpha stage and have been playing it from time to time since. great game, one of the best in the series",1
"if you like cod or bf this is not the game for you... this is a simulater, its awesome and with some select mods its more awesomererer+12x2... the built in misson editor is a bonus too, countless user created content, just buy it... go on.",2
"killed my friend with a stolen go-kart while robbing the federal bank in altis life so didnt have to split the money. i only recieved 10,000 10/10 would kill again.",1
"it is a fun game and offers improvements from the last arma",1
"its so fun but i dont have it i just got it for free i want any arma games on my wish list arma 3 and 2 with day z i wood recommend this game to people who like to take there time and some game modes like br or wastland (fun modes) like get in there and get a gun and shot people i want to keep this game so much but i cant the game mode life you might want to keep a sever faved so you can go back to it (unlike me)",1
"the one thing redeeming about this game was king of the hill. they just broke it witrh the newest patch. donty waste your money till they fix it because its unplayable.",2
"best game i have played give this game 10/10 would recomend to a friend fawking luv this game",5
"first thing first, friendlies; i play a majority of epoch at the time of the review and i have trouble finding people who want to be friendlies, even if im hollaring at them telling them that i am a fresh spawn and not to be scared they just stare.... then shoot. first game i ever played though was of wasteland and i met up with on guy who quickly made a group with me and we went driving around in a boat trying to get to a heli crash, opposed by a sniper on a hill about 1km out, and in the dead of night... that was quite fun. now i spend my time playing battle royale and building a base in epoch, which is still great fun but i still recommend getting a group of guys or girls together to get the most out of this. walking simulator? definitely, but if you ask anyone they will probably say that it is offset by the overwelming sense of adrenaline when you come across an enemy. i should add that this game isnt meant to be fun, if anything its exhilerating as its a war simulator not a game and makes you feel as if its your own life instead.",1
"brilliant game i give it a 10/10 because i look past the nitty gritty that people are always on about when it comes to this game and i fully believe that the creaters and the company do not get the credit they deserve...... think about it, its a game which the map is near enough the same geographical size of an actual island which exists and it holds so much detail and it has so much to offer... if you think differently im sorry but your life must be one of the most negative people to walk this earth lol..... i have heard people complain about the graphics for this game and to be honest i find them very good what more can you expect from a game with a map that size were every thing has to have detail. another thing, the singleplayer in this game is absolutly genius (to me anyway).... all in i would fully recommend this game to anyone. its definitly worth the money.... i cant believe people would pay like 50 for games like call of duty and then complain about the price of this one, if anything it should be the other way round.... anyways i hope that if you get this game, you will get the same enjoyment as i did and still do. :)",1
"great game, i wont say this is the best game but the best thing of the game is modification. even though the sound is bad, not that much vehicles and the functions is not enough, still you could use mods like jsrs, vehicles addons and scripts to increase your gaming experience. single-player gameplay isnt the best but multiplayer is the main point of the game. play around with friends or even build your own clan, it has great features to enrich the multiplayer game experience. every game has great points but also bad points, it does on arma 3 too. for much modifications and these beautiful graphic, 32bits game engine is clearly not enough. its sad that even you have a well built computer, it still have a  fps and much lags. biohemia has said that 64bit game engine will be avilable someday later, hope it does happen before arma 4 release. game rate: 7/10 (minecraft: 9.5/10)",3
"if you have aspergers, or just suffer from a mild retardation, this game is perfect for you. i, no different from people who play this game probably do it with friends, which means its another one of those games you purchase using a fair amount of currency, only being able to play it once every blue moon. the graphic capability of this game, combined with all the mods and possible actions on the game, makes it a nest for all that is nerdy on games. this game makes you feel you are more than just a fat, mentally challenged, reddit reader and  poster, but sulks into the deep portion of your soul which demands more action in your life, making you feel good watching the controlled fit digitally created alpha male move around while imagining it to be a representation of yourself. would give a better score if voxel mining were implemented.",1
"great game. it is such a different experience than battlefield or any other first person shooter out there.",1
"bohemia interactive needs to get their flippin act together. i can play every game on steam but this one. that is a problem. obviously, the developers at bohemia interactive dont understand that software is supposed to run on computers. if a game crashes everytime you launch it, chances are, something is very wrong. thank you for free weekend is all i can say. i was going to buy this horrible game, but now i wont because i know that this isnt worth the time and effort i put into trying to make this game work. you had one job bohemia interactive",1
"arma iii is a so vast game that 100 pages would not be enough to describe it properly. suffice to say this, then: arma iii is not a military simulator. arma iii is the military simulator. of course, there are still many small glitches and bugs that need to be fixed, but overall we are faced with a product extremely better than arma ii and any other military game ever released. in a word: masterpiece.",1
"very realistic game. spot on combat, vehicular, and weapon mechanics. my complaint only complaint can only be related to possible crappy servers i have got on or my own add...but either way, sometimes it feels like gameplay can drag on without anything happening for an overwhelmingly extended period of time. overall, 8/10 in my mind. if you are super into realism in war games, definite 10/10.",1
"an improvement over arma ii, but still needs work.",1
"awesome game to play if you into military sims, but you better have a beast of a machine to run it on :)",1
"best open world, sandbox game made to date. fluid movement, shooting and driving. top tier graphics and draw distance make it even more impressive. the newer dayz breaking point mod for arma 3 is also very good for how developed it is.",3
"best game i own. 300+ hours. strongly recommend it",2
"solid single player campaign so far, and the multitude of community missions means your hard pressed to run out of new missions to play. but this game really shines when it comes to large coop missions. i also recommend sa-matras version of the wasteland mission over the others.",1
"so basically... its the best game ever made ever. the game is my picture....buy it.",3
"this game is by far the most approachable of all the arma games, and its a hell of a lot of fun. to fully enjoy this game, you will want to have some friends, and take full advantage of the avid modding community that bi has.",2
"an amazing game, i recommend to only players who have patience and are skilled. this is not an easy game to play.",2
"its a good game 10 out of 10 stars cause 1 of the future weapons 2 cause of realizim 3 you can roleplay very well. and the game goes on and on.....",1
"there is just no other game like the arma series and arma 3 has bought hte graphics bang up to date along with a host of new features. this is far too msall a box to start going into all arma 3 can offer you. it is well worth the money and has a rich modding community. a must own.",2
"by far one of the best , or even the best fps game ive played in a long, long time.",1
"nice to play in a clan, altis life is verry fun also. dislike some buggs 8/10",2
"massive military sandbox with several weapons and vehicles as well as room for its large modding community arma 3 is a masterpiece of a game.",3
"recommend buying there is alot of gamemodes you can play. its like 1 game that includes thousands of games. its really fun. and the marksman dlc is really fun to play around with.",2
"will no longer allow for conecting to friends servers",1
"probably the most played game that has this many bugs... though the huge variety of community servers with custom gamemodes, and a really enthusiastic playerbase, makes this game great! especially with a friend or two, roaming wasteland to gear up and fight other passerbyes",1
"this game is awesome for its multiplayer and campaign and dont forget the editor part, oh gawd how many hours i have spent on editor so yeah i recommend this game if you like action and tactical combat. the dlcs on this game is great, my personal favorite dlc is the heli dlc cause i love to fly helicopters in that game, it has also a go-kart dlc and thats very fun with friends to race with. so yeah i rate 10/10",2
"f*cking best game ever and lots of diffrent game modes",2
"what more can you say, its arma. 10/10 p.s. its awesome",2
"arma 3 is one of my favorite games!!!! the only flaw it has is being really hard to get into and understand",1
"very good game. if u like military simulation. lots of awesome mods like altis life, epoch ,battle royale ect. i would suggest buying this game and it also has an awesome map editor and workshop where the possibilities are endless from creating your own mission with ai to fal ling from 10000 meters and skydiving!",2
"if you want to real reality you must play this game! its wonderfull...",1
"love altis life awesome for fps ppl and rp ppl your in for it too",1
"once again bohemia has delivered a garbage war simulator with mediocre graphics (in comparison to other war shooters in the industry) and optimization worthy of being related to the original release of crysis 1. im using a gtx780, i53750k (3.4ghz), 16gb ddr (1600mhz) and it ran pitifully. not to mention the voice acting is once again terrible and robotic sounding and the gameplay is awkward and cumbersome with the worst control scheme in the history of shooter games. i get youre going for realism, but at least try and make it accessible. you dont need crap controls to make the world more immersive; you need smoother controls so that you forget youre even playing a game. youre better off reinstalling battlefield 2 and downloading project reality if you really want an immersive war simulator.",1
"i got shot, dragged into a garage, was told i was now a sex slave, and t-bagged until my inevitable death. i then went back and thanked the people for that experience, and they shot me again.",1
"the engine looks nice, but based on the older operation flashpoint engine still. entering houses feels iffy and like walking around on honey - god forbid going prone in one... its like the house knows judo.",1
"great milsim game, cant wait to see it expand and grow into something much bigger!",3
"so, another amazing game from bohemia. arma3 is very beautifull and well made game. from arma2 it got more into simulation part, but lacks some vehicles and weapons variety, but all of that is being add... with purchasable dlc (that sucks, but for this game- worth it).",1
"big learning curve, but super realistic. its a sandbox war simulator, so you can literally be or do almost anything! really good fun once you learn the ropes and find a good squad to play with.",4
"if youre into tactical, slow paced, strat like gameplay and such this is for you. i like this game, but i always seem to compare it to arma 2. arma 2 had some great gameplay, this seems to be slower, but, i seem to like it better than arma 2. i just wish the domination gamemode was better.",1
"its a good game but it gets boaring after like a month or two... the basic game is pretty , but some mods like altis life or battleroyal keep it fun",3
"alright is this a good game or not.well if you ask me its kind of hard the controls are wierd (exept walking shhoting and spriting) and they are hard to remeber.but this game offers alot and by alot i really mean alot.good looking graphix and textures intense heartbeating combat looting military wastelands mode custom mods that i dont know how to install windows 8 skin :(.co-op and campaing are pretty good but i wish some of my other friends would ow this game but it costs a lot and its no worth of that amount of money like 25,50 euros are good price in my opinion but then it offers alot of game modes.i think this is a good game,but you should just buy it from a tf2 outpost dealer.but i got this cheaper caus of the alpha release. but overall 4/5",1
"well, after more than 450 hours on record, i have to say, it is the best game in the last years! there is so much to do with it. seemingly unlimited ways to modify the game or to make own missions with nearly unlimited access to everything you need! it deserves just one word: awesome!",3
"coming from the guys who made arma 2 and became well known because of the dayz mod, you could expect another dads game with guns and realism... it has dlcs and all the stuff that the cool kids have these days. tenouttaten/10",1
"v good this game is very good becuase i think its 100% gagster and its very good. you can play many games on the game and its very good becuase of this. i would add this game stands out for not being too arcade and this attributes to its very goodness and some of my friends play they say its very good i would recommend this to those looking for a very good game and a very good time especially if you have a very good group of friends to play some good organised very good games. theres many good roles to play some more good than others and some are the most good. thank.",2
"great game. i personally like the 2nd one better. too much gun sway in this one. much harder to effectively hit targets. vehicle control is tough to get used to. shocks act like shocks, so watch the bumps.",1
"war is hell. this game is so real its scary. 12/10 #swag",1
"this is the best fps if you want a challenging gameplay with a massive amount of players. battlefield and cod is garbage, so delete that  from your pc and get this game! arma 3 master race!",3
"gets run over by atv moving at 60 mph, only breaks legs. 10/10",1
"this game is amazing, but has its own drawbacks. first of all, absolutely do not buy this if you cant cope with slow paced combat, cause this game has a lot of it. with a huge map (270 square kilometers) you cant aspect to have players everywhere you go, and the down times between firefights can be really long. overall the best militar simulator, packed with adrenaline and realistic fights.",1
"this is an amazing game with many game modes, a bit of d-sync but its amazing, i love the multiplayer and so many mods, import mods, to mods the compleastly change the game and need arma 3 as a button, altis life arma 3 is a fun multiplayer mission, you can join the altis police department (apd) oor join the rebelion ! and if you are a fan of mods, arma 3 life will be the mod for you (still work in progress for 2014) and well, the missions and the: helping you out mission thats just the cherry on the cake for this game, i recomend you buy it whiel its in a sale, or just buy it anyway, thanks for reading, enjoy the game",2
"arma 3 is the best of its series. fantastic new look to the game, amazing single-player, just overall a great game. - 9/11 ign",1
"it was the only game i played till i had 140hrs on it. o.o",2
"very good game but you do need a decent computer to play multiplayer",5
"this game has everything you want when it comes to military simulation and actions. i personally recommend it to anyone who has a passion for war tactics and realism without cutting out the fun. a game that cannot be compared to the rest.",3
"arma 3 is a miltary simulator through and through, but unlike most simulators arma 3 has a campaign with in-depth story to boot and competitive mp thats more then decent. the ai is of a standard above what most games have to offer out there and each weapon, ground or aireal vehicle strive to give as realistic experience as can do when operating said equipment. weapons need to be zeroised and as per actual warfair artillery or mortars need to be given a grid reference (gr) before effective fire can be achieved; and you yourself can operate fire support weapons. the campaign is set into episodes and each episode has just below ten missions that offer a challenge in every aspect. although your ai teammates need to be babysitted somewhat and the game could use some more optimisation but thats a small price to pay in a game that is overall great. i score this game a 8.5/10.",1
"fantastic game, great graphics, not too taxing on system resources, great ai, and provides an unsurpassed level of emersion. arma 3 truely is the closest you can get to real combat from your pc.",1
"arma 3 is simply the best combat simulator there is. and if youre playing alone or with friends, the game is fun either way.",1
"i officially declare this game to have one of the 3 worst single player campaigns i have ever experienced in my long gaming career. whyyyy?! why did these guys waste so much time on something that that they are not good at, instead of fixing the existing bugs and adding custom content? arma iii is unique, like a special needs kid whos messed up in the head but can also hack through the most advanced security system. it has a lot of potential but you have to have a monster pc and swim through a lake of cr*p to get to the good parts. disappointed i am very much so far, but i cant not recommend this game, even in its broken state. i am however probably going to revert to arma ii.",2
"if you are looking for a real challenging game i invite you to try arma 3 cause you will die more than once during the entire game and that is a fact, no matter how many fps you have played or action and strategy games they wont be too much helpful, you will almost need a real military training to play this game because its a war simulator and hell it is hard but fun. i did not have the chance to try the full game but from what i could its fantastic its an open world in which you need to find your way in to go though and there is not just one path. you need to take your own decisions of how you are gonna make one mission depending of your resources and plan every single move you make, otherwise you are welcomed to visit death,its like chess, if you did not paid attention to the moves of your opponent you will lose. you may be freely walking and up ahead there is a patrol that you did not see coming or you step over a landmine or even fall in your own traps which happened a lot times to me. yeah i know the game is frustrating but when you fit in the game it will be a different story. and lets not forget of the beautiful graphics and enviroment that the game offers. 10/10",1
"this game is fun in all of its aspects. i enjoy the competitive gaming and the interactions with other members of your squad. of course i have played arma 1 and 2 and believe that they should have changed to a different engine. other than that i enjoy playing the game, driving the vehicles, shooting up places, and the amount of teamwork it takes to be successful in a mission. i do recommend altis life. i love the role playing and the fact that the community is really friendly. i dont like the rdming but, its something that you get used to after a while. overall this game gets a 4/5 from me. 4/5 mainly because of the glitches of the cars and the walls. but other than that i truly enjoy playing this game with friends and enemies alike. :d",1
"to be honest i might go for arma 2 this time, i dunno i think it has more... besides its cheaper, and it has dayz as well, nice community (both actually), but there is something arma 3 has never came up with..... bikes, man i use bike as weapons here, real talk... what are you going to do when you are out of ammo!?, i till what to do, use a bike simple as dat, deadly yet, convenient.",1
"treid new flying controls, stayed in the air for 5 seconds and nose dived into a fuel truck. 11/10",1
"this game is very intertaining. you can have lots of fun by playing the campaign or online. i find the best thing to playis the mod breaking point. this is a dayz like game that has a lot less problems. you can pick a faction each time you die and respawn.",1
"totally worth your money. because its like garrys mod (community made stuffs) you can download anything problem is few are only hardworking on the workshop :/ because of course its hard (high res/quality items)",1
"one of the most enjoyable militairy games out there. dynamic, with the ability to write your own missions, modding built in and endless customization. huge maps with millions of posibilities. there is literally no other gaming experience like this. even though it may seem a bit daunting at first, once you learn the ropes youre in for one hell of a ride.",1
"cant get the hang of the real game, but altis life is definetly awesome.",1
"remember when you got 40 frames in multiplayer with over 80 people? hah, neither do i.",1
"i got global banned from both arma 3 and dayz sa because i piked up hacked money in an altis life server. complete",1
"it is an amazing game with alot adventures and amazing graphics it is worth more than 36 pounds in my opinion i reccomend this game to every person that likes roleplaying flanking and doing epic things",1
"the next generation military simulator (or how bohemia call it: sandbox game). i love the details and features like weapons attachments and the new clothing system. also the new helicopter flight system is just brilliant. although i never played take on helicopters before. its just a awesome moment when flying a littlebird with the new flight system and transporting troops. cant wait for the helicopter dlc. thanks for that masterpiece bohemia interactive!",5
"i luv it cause of all da mods and every single thing aboot it",2
"a really fun game uses alot of team work and you get to shoot stuff :)",1
"great game because 1. children never play online. (no headaches.) 2. combat style is more realistic than others. 3. graphics are 10/10 4. entertaining but hard missions. 5. more dlcs to come. i would recomment the epoch mod for anyone who liked dayz. i rate this game 10/10",1
"ai snipes you with automatic rifles from miles away. ai drives into walls and trees and buildings. game looks terrible, with garbage hdr lighting system making everything too dark to see, or headache inducingly bright. stratis map is amazingly bland and uninteresting, hundreds of miles of samey boring greek villas. really sad game.",1
"i absolutely love this game. and it just keeps getting better so i can only love it more. at first it may seem daunting to dive into and get familiar with. but after a while of playing, getting used to the controls and then learning some of the more advance controls, you can wage an entire war by yourself by commanding squads or with friends by playing cooperatively. with the steam workshop you can also find hundreds, if not, thousands of user created missions that are a lot of fun. i personally suggest dynamic universal war system for a fun but brutal gamemode that is really good for co-op or solo play.",2
"probably one of my favorite and most played games 10/10 <3",2
"its a really good game, but the one problem is that all the dlcs (discounting one) need like a 10 for me, which is kinda annoying when you want to enjoy the game.",2
"arma3 , find youre self in a tank , or in a gunship or even behinde hostile lines . arma3 brings war to life with outstanding bright and ghraphics . uniqe gameplay style , from diving to skydiving everything looks so real and lovely! . course a chance to test youre strenght in leading youre men to whats right , cuz belive me once ur assinghed as a team leader , youll do whatever it takes to save youre men from whatever comes to them . as a driver of a tank . youre the most wanted in the fight with a high strenghed armor and outwilling guns , you simply have no exsuse to lose . as a chopper gunner , you carry a death strike to ur foes . 30mm gun , rockets , laser , emp , you my dear gunner hunt youre hostiles one by one . as a jet pilot , you take air and ground to your hands , with a wide selection of armory to heavy bombing . you simply have the fight won in no time . plz go buy arma3 :d",2
"best army sim on the market. price may be a little big, but i dont regret it. 9 out of 10 highly recommend",1
"great game! probably the closest you will get to a military simulator.",1
"im going to be completely honest, i bought this game almost exculsively to play the battle royale game mod. as such, i have played very little of the actual campaign of vinilla experience. i can say though that if you like or enjoyed arma style games, you will appreciate the leve of detail and dedication to realism this series provides. the controls are responsive, and the guns handle amazingly. every time i died, it was 99% my fault and the other the lag i blame and curse over the microphone as i mourn my body. if you apprciate more realism to your games then straight up, over the top action, i would recomend giving this series a try. i did not mind spending the money and i bought this before the summer sale. i would highly recomend looking at the modding scene as well which is normally very active with arma series titles (look at the dayz mod)",1
"one steam review for this game was as follows: cod = kids battlefield = big boiiz arma = men if, like that reviewer, you feel that your manhood is at stake, you might be willing to convince yourselves (and vociferously attempt to convince others) that this game is great. the tedious gameplay would be tolerable if not for the truly awful ui. maybe it makes you a man to want a game in which you crawl through grass for 20 minutes before being shot by a sniper from 1km away, so you can start the mission over. or maybe its the experience of trying to navigate poorly designed context menus when someone is getting ready to shoot you in the face, or being set back an hour of gameplay because of an invisible toggle that was on the wrong setting. this is a game for people with egos that need stroking, who think bad interface is the same as challenging gameplay, and dealing with it makes you manly. and i suppose that is a lot of men. but not this one.",1
"played co-op invade and annex last night multiplayer last night for the first time, told all of the other players that i was new, and many people were friendly with helping me out and showin me some tips. played for 4 hours, and love it already!",1
"this game is so good i love to play simulations especially military simulators. i might not have alot of hours of ingame time now but im going to be playing this game untill it gets boring.(which it doesnt)",1
"it awesome game with great features and realism, definitely recommend it to anyone",2
"arma 3 is probably the best game ive played on pc. this milsim sandbox, although incredibly fun and addictive, it is also incredibly frustrating. since its a simulator there are many things you have to learn in order to do the most simple things. but, with its incredible detail and loads of items youll probaly spend the first few hours looking at all the different guns or crashing a helicopter a few seconds after you get in it. this may seem like the game is too hard for anyone to play but trust me, after a while youll get really good at it and feel proud for some reason. this game has so much to offer with all of its combat scenarios, and with the surprisin amount content you can mess around with, it truely makes it my favorite game. 10/10",2
"bring your friends, and take down these bandits! coop in core of its meaning.",1
"dont buy it till its fixed....wish i could get a refund",1
"best game for milsim ever. if you dont own it, youre a noob.",4
"arma 3 is a military simulator, it gives the game a very realistic feel to it but the only issue is the fact that the developers of the game break things quite often and dont fix them for extended periods of time. such as the new update that came out today.",5
"the game itself is good, the multiplayer is difficult to get used to but it is insane. the only real problem with it is that the people who run the servers are all 13 year olds who have these little things called server rules which usually pertain to if you run someone over, server ban. if you kill someone outside a red circle, server ban. if you do anything fun that can make another person mad, server ban. in other words, this is not dayz where you could torture people. however- highly enjoyable game.",2
"a futureistic shooter with i high learning curve and a very active community.",1
"this game is awsome, if you are looking for a military based game that is as real as a game can get, then this game has your name writen all over it. you need communication, team work, and strategy to win, lone wolfing it or running guns blazin will fail like there is no tomorrow!",1
"its a badass game but you need 1. a good pc 2. skillz 3. good m8s 4. to have fun 68. non-rageing poweres 69. a big keyboard 70. to use wasd 71. and make catface like this ---> :3 x3 ;3 b3 and most inportantli: dont suck!!!!!!!!",2
"the first thing i would like to say is that this game runs better than arma 2. also grapics is great. but what i miss are 2-3 body hit kills, forests (i just need them, i hate playing in desert areas) and also bullets seems to fly very slowly (compared to arma 2). however i dont think this game worths 45e, it has price of 30-33e",1
"the best game on steam. never ending fun, just like arma 2 ;)",1
"awesome game! i love it. looking forward to the expansions and mods being released for this!",2
"i played cod, its ok i played battlefield, its cool i played this for a day... meh. its a game.",1
"its really cool and fun! until someone hacks your favorite server and you cant play it anymore. good game bad community",1
"it will take about 20-30 hours of playing single player to figure out how arma works. then once you go online, you will spend another 10 hours until you really start enjoying it. but once you get into it, there is nothing like it, and it will be the most amazing game you have ever played.",1
"great multiplayer. massive open world and a lots of oppertunity. this is war",2
"i really believe that this game is a complete step up from arma 2! i love it!",1
"the nato forces had us pushed back to our final two bases, i was stationed at the northern camp. our forces were beaten back hard, and we were scattered. i battled fatigue up the hill to get a vantage point looking down across the east from the beach to the mainland, i adopted the prone position and set up my lmg and scoped the area. thats when i saw it, a brown figure darting accross the fields below, performing evasive maneuvers the likes i had never seen. it was an intense 5 minutes, leading the target and squeezing the trigger to deliver a burst of rounds at my foe. finally my enemy took refuge (or so he thought) on a ridge nestled between two trees. i aimed precisely, meaning for this to end and took my final shots. i observed for several minutes when i decided to go and get a certain status on my enemy. as i walked up to the ridge i could not see my enemy in sight, so i looked around some more. it must have been 30 seconds until i looked down and saw his little b***** whiskers and his **** floppy a*** ears and noticed my god damned foe was a mother f******* bunny rabbit. 10.01/10 will definitely buy",1
"great game! nice graphics and much better fps than arma2.",1
"this game is not like any fps it delivers skill,awsomeness, and the best army simulator game out there. i highly recommend this game. in my view if you dont get arma your missing half of the greatness in pc",2
"this is probaly one of the best games out there, you can really do whatever. mods, roleplay, missions, roaming, campaign anything really. it seriously worth buying!",1
"its fun if you play it with friends or with a clan. by yourself - its worthless.",5
"must buy. great game, gameplay is much more fluid than arma 2, and mods and user created content provide endless gameplay. grab some buds, make a squad, and go kick some !",3
"other than the few glitches and bugs, this game is about the best simulator i have ever played. its your call! you can play it serious such as rpg servers or even for fun such as stratis-altis- life. the mods available are very fun and diverse! top notch!",1

"its arma, so i cant recommend it, if you ever played arma withhout beeing a fanboy you know the flaws and bugs it has cause theyre still the same as in arma 2 and thats how easy it is!",1
"to be honest like all previous bohemia games arma 3 is filled with all sorts of bugs and unfinished / half complete stuff , however there is something unique about this game , something special that keeps people playing this game .graphics , gameplay, campaign are pretty good even though they could be allot better. even though there are other military sims that are not bad at all , arma titles hold the very top . why, you may ask ? its because arma 3 provides the user with the tools to create whatever he wants. you finished the campaign ? no problem , here are hundreds of user created missions for you that you can now play. you dont like the missions ? no problem , here is the editor in which you can make ur own missions. you dont like the arma 3 factions/weapons/vehicles /visual fx/sound/ai/realism ? no problem , here , download the hundreds of mods available for free. you want to create ur own content ? here are the modding tools , you can do / create whatever you want with them. and this is what makes arma 3 special .i am sure bright future awaits this game if the devs listen to the community and the community stays loyal to this game.recommended.",3
"first impression - nice graphs, what i mean it is epic nice, on the other hand, hard to get familiar with inventory, selection stuff, but all in all it is worth price. ....so only few words about this awsome goodness. way better than arma2, if you think your computer cant handle this game. trust me it can, even if arma2 were lagging for you. :)",2

"whoever is over the aiming department .to you sir i say.....duh....duh...duh...downsyndrom you   .i shoot alot in real life and this...this is just pathetic,like truly pathetic.the skill it takes to hit someone running without a gun is just godlike.in real life hitting fast targets really isnt no more difficult than one moving slow but yall act like it takes a navy seal to shoot a gun.i dont know if yall are part of the anti gun group that thinks you dont have control of your gun while aiming but you do.even a 5 year old does",2
"if anyone has the copy of arma 3 give it to me and if you dont buy it if you have enough money",1
"the best arma game iv played, it has beutiful graphics, great gameplay, and good addon. if you are looking for a game like battlefield or call of duty this game is not for you it a lot more realistic than those two, so you actually have to plan how to carry on a mission and watch what you carry, sound not fun but once figure out how to play its really fun i totally recomend it.",1

"i love this game so much. but you really need to enjoy these types of games in order to keep playing this title from behemia interactive. this game has its ups and downs, first ill start with the cons .... you need a beefy computer to run it. this game is really taxing for your pc even though on max settings it doesnt look that amazing. its only because of its huge map and sandbox gametype. this game also has a few bugs that you can ignore because it doesnt affect your gameplay. but this game is fun as hell. delviering realistic gameplay like you are truely in the army fighting, i suggest putting on headphones and maxing out the effects sound option so those gunshots are loud! this game gets really intense, because you know even one bullet could end you... overall i suggest you buy this game but maybe when its on sale. if this game sounds amazing to you, then buy it now. 8.5/10",1
"really good game, i recommend it to anyone who enjoys teamplay. note: it is hard to understand the game at first, however later on, ones you understood the game it is really enjoyable.",3
"great military simulator with heaps of mods and fun multiplayer to keep you entertained for days, 9.5/10.",4
"best multiplayer game i own. always fun playing with friends and it never gets boring. if you dont have friends its still fun. awesome graphics and nice sounds. unique gameplay that you never get bored of. for extra fun buy the karts dlc or the dlc bundle, totally worth it!",3
"this sim is the best yet and has promised and carried it out. i have been with it since the first days of the pre alpha thru now an for years to come. my squad mates all moaned about it being to much like a sim than a game, well dah it is and much more. several has since jumped on the bandwagon and a few other that like arma ii have stepped over the line as well. all in all i would say that my word of mouth was directly responsible for 17 copies being purchased and countless other indirectly! keep up the great work!! wheelchair",2
"i recommend this game to anyone who likes a more realistic type of shooter. this game also has a big modding community so there are tons of different ways to play the game. controls are most fluid then arma 2 and it feels more natural and less mechanical. it does still have a slight mechanical feel but that just goes with the genre. every act requires you to take a second to complete that task just like rl. i didnt log many hours when i first got it but iv recently found servers that run the sc (sector control) game mode and its fantastic. you gain levels by being in the target sector and money to buy new gear. il keep this brief but its a great game and keeps getting better with every update.",1
"this is a great game i recommend it to all my friends. reasons why: it is fun !, many possibilities, online gameplay, many updates, cool gameplay, great campains and lot of weapons and cars. fun to play and really sweet graphics! only one thing.... they must make more maps!! stay aswome arma iii !!",2
"for an alpha this gives us a short but sweet insight visa what to expect in armas future. and the future is bright. decent performance, beautiful islands (only 1 included in this alpha), many improvements in movement, weapon systems and physics and best of all searchlights on helios that work!. and look sweet! that first moment when you look up at a lighthouse in the night and see those beams of light piecing the darkness youll know that arma should have a decent future when finally released. best of all, if you buy the alpha itll automatically upgrade to the beta and then the retail release for no extra cost! just dont forget to report those bugs eh? (the alpha is still buggy, has some ai issues and balancing issues. it is also short of content. do not expect a campaign or full featured game until release)",1
"i dont play classic arma 3 modes, but i play battleroyale and its awesome! highly recommended for expirienced fps players who love hardcore gaming. sadly arma 3 has lots of troubles with fps and it not so easy to google the solution, but its still very good game!",1
"this game..... i wont say its bad but bohemia really needs to optimize its games better. every game i have played on my pc can get a minimum of 45 fps in almost any scenario on max settings, except this one. when i play on medium settings in single player i get about 50 fps but when i play on a multiplayer server, no matter what the server is or where it is i will get around 20 fps. that just confuses me, and it really impares my experience of the game, because i bought this game (not at full price) to play the multiplayer because i wanted to have some fun in wasteland or mabey even just a tdm. i cant do that though because when i say around 20 fps i mean 23 max fps and that was rare. even after the multiplayer was supposedly more optimized i still had the same issues. i really want to like this game, but i cant because again, the framerate in multiplayer is just not playable. being that i bought this game for multiplayer and i cannot use that i have to give this a bad review. 4/10",1
"great game,very good,so much fun playing with or without your mates,highley recomended",2
"with this you can have fun !!!! ( altis life rpg ) if you want to be serious then you can have even more fun :) altis life rpg to be honest it took me a little while to adjust from playing arma 2 to arma 3 but once you have found your footing youll be a right happy chappy :) at this time the game is on a free weekend so i recommend that you try it .",1
"after 500 hours of gameplay experience ive decided to write a proper review on this game. now lets get started. the multiplayer is way off for a game this huge the fact that your gonna be getting 60 fps barely is disappointing. it drops to 50 to 25 in a few mins. they overprice their dlcs and give little content. most people on this dont dislike other fps shooters because of exo suits or police brutality such as call of duty and battlefield hardline. they choose to like this game because of their own ignorance and their specs being so low this is the only crap they can run. the single player is a waste of time it is completely boring and long. the only now read this part steady only reason this game is getting a thumbs up is because of the mods. most of the mods are very very entertaining hell if they just got the mods and turned them into games there would be no point to this. if you choose to buy this go ahead if you dont, dont",3
"its an ok game best part of the game is obviously its multiplayer but with the constant connection problems it can be a drag and its not realy worth a buy considering other games do mp better!",1
"the best massively open world first and third person shooter i have every played. arma 3 makes call of duty advanced warfare and battle field 4 look likes child play. the amount of detail in all there helicopters, tanks, troop transports, characters, weapons, maps, lighting, effects, go-carts is overwhelming! sometimes when im flying over a city getting ready to para-drop into a hell fire of tanks and jets, i feel like im watching a hd action movie of the year! i dont what i love most about this game the most, might be laying in the grass on a hill a mile away from any conflict staring down my scope of my rifle calculating the wind and the bullet drop, then taking the shot. no game has every made me feel so rewarded when i complete a mission. amra 3 missions are not these 5 minute deathmatches there long fought out high action battles. also there map is so big its insane, and its not just one island, theres others that are insanely big, i cant even imagine how long it would take to go from one side of the main island to the other flying in a helicopter going over 200+ miles per hour. lastly very unique complex non-repetitive terrain. love it, care for it, buy it!",2
"pretty basic until you get mods for it. find a good community of gamers who game regularly and with good mods and this becomes one of the best games youll ever buy. im going to fail my degree because of this game. 10/10",4
"a fantastic military sandbox with many addons & mods to experiment with. it has its fair share of cons and pros, the cons laying mostly with the multiplayer aspect of the game. if you intend to buy this game, i recommend upgrading your cpu as well as your gpu pc specs (if yours dont already meet recommended specs). while singleplayer is a graphical  and is fantastic to play on maxed out settings, multiplayer youll find it the complete opposite. multiplayer i found is managable only if you can deal with the fact that you may have to play on low graphical settings. as a cpu intensive game for multiplayer, youll have to deal with lower fps and graphical settings if you intend to play on bigger servers. on smaller servers, higher fps is attainable as well as higher graphics. if you can deal with this con that arma3 bears in its mutiplayer system, then your time & money will be well spent on this game. away from the cons and on to the pros, this game is the best military sandbox out there. with arma3s many details and functions you can find yourself commanding a squadron of jet-fighters or leading a squad to capture a control point. the scenarios are limitless with arma3s steam workshop integration. all in all id give this game a 9/10.",4
"if you want ruin your life away aimlessly runn--err driving from place to place, hoping to god you dont get roadblocked by the cops with 4 people carrying as much herione as you body will allow, then this game is for you. if you like being those cops stopping those four people with as much cocaine as possible then this is for you too. or you if you like being clean and runnung salt, theres that too, for you. but really though, the mp is crazy, especially the altis (rpg) map, which is where these scenarios would happen. the campaign is really complex for you hardcore gamers who really get into and is very nice i might add. only gripe from me and its on my end is that my damn third person button wont work. so since its the free weekend and on a ridiculous sale (10/23-10/26) get it get it now asap and any other acronym you can think of for something speedy, its that good.",2

"i dont have much of a game time in this game yet, but from what ive played and from what ive seen... its by far one of the best games i have played, its a massive open world army simulation kind of game, youre not being given anything like the enemy being highlighted ect, you have to use your eyes and ears and watch your every step... 8/10 maybe a couple of improvements can be made, but its deffo one of the best games i have played and id reccomend it to anyone with a bit of patience as its not as fast paced like games such as call of duty ect",1

"this game is great and very realistic, but you definitely need to play this with friends and it has a definite learning curve.",1
"ill admit, i was super excited to try this game out solely because of the depth of graphics and immersion portayed for itself. unfortunately, even with a high-end graphics card, the game averages itself around 15-35 fps on everything ultra; which barely seems fair seeing as how a gtx 560 is recommended, yet i have a 970 ftw! i know this is a big game, but it really sucks having to turn down the graphics just for a smoother experience but not having the edgy visuals that looked really awesome for this game.. i guess ill have to be more careful on how i spend $60 next time.. tl:dr my standards may be a little high, but if youre someone who can enjoy 30-35 fps for a pc game with lower graphics settings applied, then go ahead and see if this game tailors itself well to you!",1

"lots of running around, not much action. if you are really into c.o.d. or b.f. you probably will not find this slow-paced game very interesting. on the plus side it does have some of the best weapon, player, and vehicle graphics that exist right now.",1

"arma 3 so when i saw this game for the first time, i thought that soon will release another excellent piece arma. however, the first disappointment was already in anticipation, as the extremely small amount of technology and absence campaign. but this disappointment disappeared when issuing the first chapter of the campaign was excellent and the new technique also appeared. but i will not criticize. i must say that the guys from bohemians are struggling and working hard to repair, etc. graphically its a big shift but a new engine this could offer more. the playing area is huge and real and opens new possibilities for mods. technical equipment and weapon was terrible at the beginning and the newly added equipment was broken but gradually improves and fixes. despite this, however, it is compared arma i and ii, step backward. personally, i think that would bohemia interactive could use a better future. on the other hand, however, the campaign is excellent, what more can i say. final verdict: arma iii is an improved forward, but it is incredibly untapped potential. if it bohemia interactive put in the time and dedicated technicians and armor, or even a new engine, so it would be something completely different, much better. 8/10",1

"this is a great game and well worth the money spent. however, since ive been playing from the begining of the alpha, its not quite as fresh as id like. good on its own, but far better with friends, a dedicated server, and some decent co-op missions. the dlc is not worth mentioning, unfortunately.",4
"very good modern military simulator. you have a fun editor you can play with, with a host of different options for making missions, stories, and massive battles where everything is annihalated and you start the third world war. have you ever wanted to pilot an a-10 warthod and blow a tank apart with that massive minigun everyone talks about? this game... has the next best thing. nah, but it is pretty similar, and it is quite a fun plane to fly. make sure you have a decent computer before attempting the really massive battles with dozens of infantry and support units. the game also hosts a large amount of mods that come from a dedicated and creatively endowed community. i recommend.",1

"ya its a great game if you enjoy using the editor. new features with the ability to change stances is very cool. graphics are much improved from arma ii, but this game is not playable on multiplayer. some might say you must have a high spec processor and graphics card, but then why can i play single player with 60 fps on ultra.(i have fx-4170 4.2ghz cpu, r9-270 gpu) multiplayer matches have only the ability to deliver 20 fps which is just unplayable. then people say you must find a good server, but nearly every server is this way, unless i play a small 4 man coop mission which isnt even the selling point of this game. i thought this game was meant to be played on huge multiplayer missions on huge maps but it hasnt gone that way and hasnt been that way since the alpha.",1

"in my opinion, much better than any of the previous arma games. first and foremost where do i start? the animations, the graphics and the physics are all improved perfectly and it just feels like you are at war! the optimization gives you much more freedom to tweak graphical settings. the co-op just has to be the best feature, knowing that everyone depends on you and you depend on everyone as a team.",1

"arma 3 improves on all the aspects of the previous games. it is a military simulator with more focus on infantry than vehicles. theres still plenty of vehicles and you can drive all of them. the biggest thing about this game is that the most of the content is coming from the community and not the developers. modding is encouraged and missions can be made with an absurd amount of difference with only the in-game mission editor. and your gaming experience is heavily dependent on what kind of mission you play. the games campaign is now fully out and so far its been fun but the story is so and so. all in all its a solid good game that you may or may not like. you die quickly and most of you time might be just spent on getting to the action. so if all you want is action, i suggest you try other games.",2
"maybe i just dont get it? maybe ive just been playing too much ghosts and hawken lately to really appreciate it? maybe i was just bored this weekend and couldnt pass up a steam sale? id say get this if you know somebody in real life to play with online. i dont even feel like going into detail, but this is not a good single player campaign compared to some of the other fps titles out. i think the goal of the developers was to create a realistic sandbox and they succeeded there, with respect to bullet trajectory and not being able to get shot up and instantly heal like in other games. it sounds like a lot of people enjoy creating custom missions and getting together as a group to play them. but despite all that, id rather read a tom clancy novel or watch an oliver north show than play this game.",1
"great military sim. this does not play out like a run-and-gun game like bf4. this is a tactical shooter and you have to take movement slow and methodical. ai is extremely efficient at killing you, so you cant go in guns-blazing. it has about 5 different character classes to choose from, as well as rarely used vehicles. each class has their own abilites and weaponry. i would not recommend this game to anyone except those who have a high end cpu and video card because this games graphics and netcode are very poorly optimized, causing even the best computers to run at low fps. i have an i7-4790k overclock 4.4ghz cpu, 16 gig ram, and gtx780s in sli and i get from 30-50 fps in multiplayer. most ppl get below 30.",2

"hmm.. what can i say about arma 3? i mean.. i cant describe it because of its awesome epicness. just buy it and u will never play another game ;)",3
"if your an arma fan this game wont dissapoint. its not fps in the sense that you dont have a health bar ect, one shot can kill you if placed right. this makes for using tactics all the more important. you dont just charge into a fight guns blazing, instead you tend to plan your approach and put alot more effort into each scenario. this is a true combat simulator and the best ive played of the arma series so far.",1
"military simulation at its finest, my own disappointment is the flow of content, other than that the combat mechanics are incredible. there is all kinds of community content that even further improves the game as well.",1
"feels wrong writing a review of this game now as its not finished. the engine alone is just limitless to what can be created. the online community is very active providing a mass of servers and different game types. overall awesome game and can only get better.",1
"arma 3, the best military sim out there. me and my squad load into the plane, just another drop in an enemy town. the plan was to sabotage th aa so we could carpet bomb the place. our recon ****** up. we were supposed to drop in far enough away so are plane wouldnt get hit, but apparently the aa were farther up than expected. jump! jump! jump! our sargent said. we all jumped. into the forest surrounded by the enemy. we all rallied at the plane crash, and decided to fortify there to hold off the enemy. we will die today men, but for every man hit, ten of theirs will fall! they closed in... we shot six rounds.. they responded with artillary.. oohh, the artillary. i surived with broken legs. just me. all alone. as i crawled through the carnage, i saw sarge, lying their, blood seeping through his cloaths. i black out, from the loss of blood. and i never wake up. ever, ever, again.",1
"come join my new server! help me expand my player base and help the server become popular arma 3 epoch with all-terrainpack enabled. - 88.150.150.250:2382 temaspeak 3 - 85.236.100.27:19147",2
"arma 3 is a great game. love the steam workshop adds more to the game. the only problem is that you ned a best pc to run the game, the singalplayer whorks great",1
"this game was good but, developers lost their minds and game is downgrading. they dont make additional things that ppl ask for (still no working bipods, no fastroping builded in the helis) half of the vehicles are mix of everything from every nation available in the game, there was plenty of a time to release really stabilized version but still every patch just  ups everything, right now optimalization is below a$$",2
"very fun, the possibilities are limitless with this game engine!",2
"arma 3, a game, about being in the army... that was the summary, of the entire game... and the free-battle mode... 10 / 10 would fight again",1
"awesome sandbox game and the modding possibilities! having a blast with altis life mod atm, try it out, best game until dayz sa gets in beta.",1
"amazing game best military game i have ever played if you get it you need to play on 23rd servers on coopertive missions its so real and amazing also come join are clan!!!!",5
"this game is actually a 100% accurate and very elaborate and detailed invasion plan for the greek island of lemnos, with two of the games developers being arrested in greece on charges of espionage. the dates in the game itself correspond to invasion plans written up for the island, which were leaked by edward snowden.",1
"if you were looking for a tacticool military shooter that is going to take hours out of your life, look no further, for you have found your game. arma 3 includes: -sleek helicopters -guns of the future -x-ray visioned ai -sleek tanks -an oversized flat map -an undersized hilly map -good multiplayer -and more! squeakers may appear on weekends.",3
"terrible optimization, controls, plot and animations. most of servers have white list so they will kick out as you join them. when you find a good server all you play is a walking simulator and not a war game. i am not a call of duty or battlefield fan but i think they are good games if you compare them to this. also, people pretend this war game is realistic. no, its not. the only realistic thing is the boredom",1
"amazing game, a real step up from arma 2, if you are into fun games, get this one.",2
"i have really come to enjoy arma 3, it was difficult at first to understand the controls . after thirt minutes of gameplay i was really good. i would recomember this to people who enjoy serious tatical gameplay.",1
"i have to say that this game is a worthy successor of the arma series. it takes aspects of the other games and improves them, while adding new content and a storyline that hasnt had a single broken level, or ai with a choppy voice. however, this game just isnt finished yet. id wait until the horrible fps drops on multiplayer are fixed. once that is done, the game will be perfect. wait a while before you purchase this game.",2
"for a military simulator it doesnt give you a realistic experience of  yourself in a desert",2
"this game is not for those who believe call of duty and/or battlefield is realistic. this is as close to realism as you can get without actually going to war. this is a breath of fresh air to anyone who wants an authentic military feel in their games.",5
"im going to cry myself to sleep after the free weekend is over.",1
"difficult to master but awesome to play. realistic army sim.",1
"this game is ing amazing you should buy this amazing game",1
"you must want to play it to enjoy it. i really enjoy this game. to be honest, it is my favorite multiplayer of all time. i would recommend it for anyone who is looking for uniqe moments in gaming. note you must be willing to put up with a heavy learning curve to play this game. but in the end it is very much worth it.",1
"while the game may be buggy and doesnt have as much content as arma 2, this game is still brilliant the campaign is quite good and the multiplayer has multiple different modes from altis life for those who like rpg games to the various msos that the hardcore realists play on it has something for everyone especaly with the workshop intigration",1
"10/10 game. altis life is awesome and the graphics are amazing. 10/10 +1",4
"just wow! there is so muuuch to discover in this game! unlimited potential to rpg gaming! i really enjoy altis life ! hope there will be much more added, so i dont need to go outside anymore and can do all my stuff inside my second life in altis.",1
"this game is amazing, personally it blows cod and battlefield out of the water, then again those two arent exactly milsims, however this game is just brilliant, one minute you can be running through woods not an enemy in sight, next minute youll be surrounded by a squad of enemy soldiers and youre just screwed 10/10",1
"please be aware, this game does not work for many people. if you dont believe me please read teh forums about this ame. many people have this issue and no one has an answer/or is willing to help. i cant even get my $49.99 back.",1
"what can i say about arma 3. definitively, not a lot seeing as my fairly robust system can not handle the online component of this game. its a simulation. vast, endless even, and unforgiving. both in terms of learning curve and on your cpu. sadly my amd a8 6600k can not handle this game and i get around 10 to 25 fps online on a good server with good scripting. if you want the biggest war simulator on the block with limitless potential, and insanely dedicated community of player and modders then arma 3 is the game you want, but only if you have a good intel processor to handle the spectacle and scale of it all. arma is in a class all its own but the sheer ammount of content, even in such short time in terms of mods and even official content makes it worth every penny. go in with some friends and prepare to make memories.",2
"arma 3 had a horrible release, it took about a year just to make it somewhat decent, still not a great game. arma 2 is still far better in my opinion.",1
"this game best of first person shooting.if you play it with friends, you really enjoy it !! 10/10",1
"amazing gameplay with the track ir 5. amazing gameplay without it. keep your head down or you going night night. 10/10.",1
"this is a truly amazing game. i have over 300 hours and cant stop playing :)",3
"optimization is horrible. i have an octa core and the cpu usage never dips over 30%. this causes my graphics card usage to never go over 30% as well. good game, poor optimization. the advantages outweigh the cons however as the devs continue to update and patch the game making it better and better. edited from a negative to positive.",1
"good game... for when it works. it keeps crashing all the time",1
"a man in underwear crashed a quadbike into me. 10/10",2
"love the instense battles, graphics in this game. arma is always a must have",1
"the best combat/tactics/war game available today. and there are awesome mods where you can display how far bullets fly and how devastating they are!",2
"i remember getting arma 2 on special back in the day, played it once then put it on the shelf. then i seen this mod called dayz and i have been sucked into the arma world ever since. more to the point, arma 3. a vast improvement on its predecessor but still a game that takes a lot of trial and error before you really get the hang of it and can appreciate the engine. the single player campaign was slowly worked on and released over time, with fixes and improvements over a period of time to end up with a really nice and although linear storyline, they really add elements that allow you to verge away from the main storyline and engage in heaps of other tasks and activities ( i had to play the main campaign twice to appreciate it) the main reason to get arma 3 though is the mods. from breaking point, epoch to a heap of mission maps and game modes, arma really throws a lot of diversity at you and is great bang for your buck.",3
"ive played dayz and this game totally beats it. with the customization available, there is really nothing bad about this game. there is occationally lag spikes and fps drops but thats probably just me. great game!",1
"imagine you got a cake. you cover that cake in nutella. you eat the cake which is smeared in the good stuff, and experience a wonderful foodgasm. i just described this game. i r8 8/8 m8.",1
"10/10 would get stuck in a rock again! in all seriousness this game really puts it all on the table, realistic bullet drop, realistic combat and ai (youll die a lot), expansive maps, team effort, and a fun time. anyone looking for a replacement for combat sims, or shooters need not look further! just watch out for rocks :)",1
"great game, couldnt play it cuz my computer is sh**. but a great game you should get it!",1
"bought the game - have been terribly unhappy with the slow rate of updates, the unoptimized graphics engine, and general lack of content. an open world with very little in it - not very much fun at all.",3
"ing get me this game someone pl,ease edit: i got the game, it is a wonderful game. realistic, fun and you can do anything your mind pleases. for new players i recommend wasteland, king of the hill, and battle royale",1
"if you like dayz kinda action, and you are willing to rpg. altis life mod for arma 3 is verry cool, look up a good community and get your life going. get a job: pick apples, peaches, mine for iron, copper, salt and even diamonds. become a criminal, and pick, process weed, cocain or heroin. become a cop, arrest ppl. search vehicles, and hunt people that have a price on their head. you can even become a rebel. before you get a life on a server, read the rules of a server, the rules may vary on each server, if you want to become a cop, most of the time they want you white-listed. the server i play on the most: serverfilter: trinity join me.",2
"is it good? hell yeah is it call of duty? hell no is it worth waisting an entire day in your life? hell yeah",1
"before i bought arma 3 it had been sitting in my wish list for a long time! lets start with the obvious, it takes a few hours to finally start to get used to it and even longer to learn the controls. but once you know all that, arma 3 will be an amazing game that makes you feel like your in a real world situation. i cant tell you if you should buy this game because you should keep in mind its not one of your cod face to face pew pew kinda game, its all as realistic as it can be so it almost perfectly matches the afghanistan nato deployment! i remember sitting for 2 hours and a half in prone with a sniper and picked off about a dozen soldiers! if your into simulations then this is a game for you!",2
"well for the time that i had to play arma it was very fun, but it is very damanding for graphics. after i had 3 days to play it i tryed to open it but then i got this steam update news with nothing on it and this came up every time so i had to uninsatall the game......",1
"this game, epic. if you like war games (and who doesnt like war games?) then this game is perfect for you! currently its in alpha so the map is only 20km^2 large, but the full map will be ~270km^2 large. i personally love this game, its a must play!",2
"it was a bad investment you ask why? well the frames per second were below average even when set at low settings maybe they need to optimize the game a little more i dont know. my recommendation is if you dont have a up to par gaming pc dont buy it.",1
"an amazing game take a little while to get used to the controls but the campaign has an amzing story line and the multiplayer is unmatched.",5
"arma 3 has given me the best milsim sandbox experience up to date. you can make your own scenarios, choose your own loadouts and overall a great game to co-op with. it has infantry combat, ifv/armored combat, and air combat.",3
"been playing arma games since 2006. and before that the old of. and they continue to be my favourite games of all time. and although arma 3 is still in alpha i can see this game exceeding the previous games, and becoming another great war sim to play for many more years. id highly recommend this if you enjoyed arma 2.",1
"dont waste your money on this one if you ask me. if youre really really in to tacital  like this, then get it, if youre a pro cod camper then play it because thats all you do; camp. the game is camping and running to better camping spots and when you see something hostile lagging to hard to do anything about it. you need a great computer and some google help to have okay fps and you need extreme patience to connect to servers and actually play the game.",1
"this game is plain amazing. it will give you countless hours of gameplay hours to play with your friends or even by yourself. there is workshop support/many mods that add new scenarios everyday. the developers are also constantly working on this and they come out with a major update about every month that adds even more hours. there is a singleplayer campaign that will probably last around ten hours(im not sure about this) with a great story that helps you get to understand the game in more depth. the multiplayer has tons of servers and tons of players with a bunch of different amazing modes. 10/10 superb game that will last you forever.",1
"well th game its self is amazing omfg i love it better then dayz i really love it buy im really pissed that after a week of owning it.it will not load anymore it just says preparing to launch aram 3 and it sits there for hours and does nothin make sure you have a poweful pc or a gaming pc because a crappy family or business pc wil not do it but other then that its really good",1
"for me is this the most realistic game ever! campain is less boring than in flashpoint and previous arma series. for me is main editor. you can create what you want. you can make funny scenes etc. this game is really originally and one of few games what are good for buy. authors are looking after this game -> thats next reason. this is not wasted many !",1
"i dont get why theres so many good reviews for this game. yes its fun but its so unfinished in terms of realism, yes you can say this game is as realistic as it gets and its difficult, but giving ai unforgiving aim and reaction time isnt realism people. this games idea is a gemstone but they chipped away it and cut corners while making this one, they actually just didnt even work hard, the flow of the game is just dull and the physics are god awful, cars get stuck on fences, helicopter blades fly off when you hit a tent, you get stuck in floor for vaulting? its just so hard to play with the game mechanics just being unfinished. its fun to play with friends but when it falls to the milsim portion you just cant. specially trained soldier? cant run 20 meters without breathing your entire lung capacity. need to snipe some taliban? oh heres no bipod. driving 120kms an hour? here hit a bush and explode its just so hard to play with this broken engine. go back to arma 2.",2
"love the game!. havent had as much fun playing a game as i have this one in a long time. the multiplayer mod servers are where you will have the most fun at!.",1
"this game is absolutely amazing. it can be whatever you want it to be deliver any experience you are looking for. whether that be hardcore realism like no other game imaginable, shooting with your friends and driving karts, simply taking in the beauty, and everything inbetween, this game can provide it. it may be slow paced at times, but this allows for a scale beyond all others. in no other game can i say that i had a good time in a mission, but also have used my compass more than my trigger.",3
"this game is awesome just the roleplay mode is awesome!!!!!",1
"except for the dlc content overlay whenever you jump in a dlc vehicle, great game and so many possibilities. ive spent many hours and made many friends with this game. a good game for your library.",2
"well where should i start... i never played any arma title until now. arma3 as the main game got a great storyline. for the multiplayer, well i bought it just for altis life - mod :d but this mod is awesome! altis life is an role playing mod with standart rp rules (on the most servers). you can chose to be a normal guy, farming salt, gold, diamonds or go fishing, selling the stuff for better equipment, cars or helicopters. or.. you can farm cannabis, cocain and heroin. become a rebel and fight the police and the system. steal money from the good people and so on. every cop inside the game is a real player! you chose !",1
"this game is awesome, you have to try out stratis wasteland or king of the hill game modes :p",1
"best military sandbox experience.. free community driven content.",2
"this review is for a badge but this is still a great game!",3
"arma 3 really is a great game and is by far the best military sim on steam. the core game itself has good content and a few nice game modes, however the mods such as battle royale and altis life really bring this game to life.",1
"tried playing on win7 x64/intel celeron 1037u/4gb ram/hd graphics - 20-30 fps@800x600(everything low/turned off) and pemanent problems with the game ui and mouse - it starts working only after i switch the ui scale. multiplayer crashes (tried playing some rpg mode)",1
"armas control system is more complicated than a woman. and i seem to spend more time arguing with it than i do my wife. having said that, its a beautiful game with lots of potential fun, but seriously, why is it so hard to change how i look down my scope? stupid bloody overcomplicated control system...grump.",1
"i have a love/hate relationship with this game. the action menu needs to die, the people on the game need to shove a big black  in their mouth and choke on it and a lot of other  that i wont go into. other then all that, this game looks spectacular, the most realistic game i have ever played. on my rig it looks absolutely ing beautiful, you need a beast of a computer to run this game and see its true potential. this is the closest thing to real life as far as gaming comes along. also, i cant tell you how many hours i have into this game and ive only had it for about a month! arma 3 is a must have, get this game now, if you dont have this game youre missing out on hours of fun!",4
"great game, have a pretty  laptop but suprizingly i lag on arma 2 and dayz standalone, but i can run this at 50 fps, i brought it in sale for $40 next day, down to $30, wtf steam! could of spent the extra $10 on a months subscription on brazzers.. -_-",1
"really good game, i recommend it to anyone who enjoys teamplay. note: it is hard to understand the game at first, however later on, ones you understood the game it is really enjoyable.",3
"arma 3 is one of the best looking games ive played. great graphics and a great smilitary simulator. you should definetly get this game.",1
"from altis life to breaking point arma 3 has become one of my favorite games. their are countless amounts of missions and game modes you can play, i highly recommend this game to everyone!",1
"epic game. amazing graphics, super immersive, and generally great at what it does. however, some people may not like what it does. it is very much a simulator, so it takes time to get in to. and playing with the right people, is almost essential to get the full experience. that is however not a bad thing, cause the depth that this game delivers makes it one of the best games i have ever played",1
"its everything you love about sandbox games, mixed with everything you love about battlefield 3 but with everything you hate about call of duty stripped. buy it.",1
"really really great. i love it, but i always get so sidetracked than i cant freaking finish the campaign. mods are fun tho, and the missions are sometimes better.",1
"after 401 hours on this magnificent game, i reccommend it to you. edit: i have no life. if you doubt how good it is, check out gameplay videos or screenshots. do eit.",3
"such a good game everything about it is great you should definetly pick it up",2
"8/8 mate would play arma 3 again m8 i r8 8/8 would masterb8 m8 nice b8 m8",1
"its grown on me a little......*looks at hours played*",2
"great game! tons of gamemodes and tons of things to do. the campaign is awesome along with the multiplayer. i would reccomend this game! 10/10",1
"great game, hours of fun but you need a good computer to run it nicely",2
"great game, one of the best all around modern day, military sim.",2
"bohemia once again leaves it to the fanbase to fix a broken game. implementing future armaments was a really silly decision and it leaves huge holes in balance and playability. put in modern weapons and vehicles and if you charge for it you can  right off.",1
"good for people that like real army simulation. there are some really hardcore servers, then there are just silly ones. all in all a great game.",2
"wanna play a war simulator? arma 3 is the best! play with friends and have fun!",2
"besides the lights shining through mountains, this game is epic. by far one of the best sandbox simulators i have ever come accross. so much smoother than arma 2, arma 3 has the ability to make you forget you are in a game.",1
"wow! very impressed with it, far slicker and fluid in movement and in performance. it all just feels right and they have improved upon all the failings i saw with arma 2. you can run up a hill now, wheeled vehicles can get up inclines and dont get damaged by nudging a rock and the physics are nice, id definitely recommend getting this if you enjoyed arma 2",1
"this (like all the other arma games) is a great game. there is just so much to do with the workshop that i would never get bored. multiplayer is also fun. single player : i dont really play single player in arma games mainly because the ai, but it is great. mutliplayer : multiplayer is awesome! you can play actual gamemodes like invade & annex, wasteland, or domination. then you can play the rp gamemodes like altis life or takistan life. i give this game a 8/10 could be optimized better.",1
"i recommend this game it has a tactical aspect and good graphics.also good gameplay.",1
"arma 3 is a good game, but it is still a work in progress. there are many bugs and glitches that will be punched out as time goes by, but that shouldnt keep you from buying the game. look at arma 2, it has become a huge success, mostly tahnks to dayz but its rp aspect. arma 3 is a truly next-gen game which is capable of doing so much. buy it, dont ask any questions, just do it.",1
"a game for the die hard virtual combatant with tons of player created and plot driven experiences well worth your time and money (note: for best experience find a solid active clan or gaming community )",3
"absolutely amazing game, never had as much adrenaline in my life! when you are in combat, it feels like you are in deep  in real life... dont masturbate after infantry combat, your hands shake and it is not physically possible, but hey...give it a try",2
"dont get me wrong its an ok game but there is some stuff thats bad about it. first of all the ai. the ai once just circled around in a helicopter without even reaching the waypoint. they also repeat everything they say. lastly the realism. i know many of you dont care but its not as realistic as arma 2. in arma 2 you could kill someone with one shot but not in this one. it took me like 10 with a rifle. i do not recomend this game unless there is a huge update. lastly i forgot the physics",2
"while i dont own the game and only played on the free weekend this has to be one of the best games i have played in awhile so what im saying is 10/10",1
"played king of the hill stole helicopter everyone entered helicopter i tried to fly helicopter i crash helicopter into spawn got abuse in chat 10/10 would get called  pilot again.",1
"this game is very fun i reccomend the dayz arma mod.",1
"its a fine arma til you look at all the locked  they are throwing on,  you bohemia. and not only that they charge full price for the ing game and all this  dlc for a military sim, like  that noise if im spending close to that much$$$$$$$$$ ill be playing a ing game worth buying for that much, not some  sim that got stupidly popular caus of a deadass mod.",1
"awesome graphics and the gameplay is highly realistic",1
"bohemia once again leaves it to the fanbase to fix a broken game. implementing future armaments was a really silly decision and it leaves huge holes in balance and playability. put in modern weapons and vehicles and if you charge for it you can  right off. edit: now its fixed",1
"not a huge fan of this game, but....i am really liking the breaking point mod for it. is it worth $60 ? not for the game, but for the mod, it could be close. keep an eye out on sales for arma 3, get it then, and immediately download the breaking point mod. much better",1
"quite possibly the most in depth shooter ive ever played, even in alpha stage it still blows me away. the graphics are insane, the guns feel realistic, the movement system is revolutionary, and its just too much fun.",1
"not a game for the casual shooter. slow and steady is the key as this is a simulator, not an arcade game. those who love combat realism will love this. with realistic physics, there is a lot to do in this simulator.",1
"i must say that this is the best millitary simlation/sandbox game everrr!! everything is great about this game! however i not so famillar with arma series, but damnn the game is good, especially the graphics. one thing i dont get used to is the controls. there are so many things going on, and i love it. so the conclusion is that i would 100% recommend it!! 9/11",1
"if you like team based war games that people accualy work as a team in this is for you i rate it better than wiping your  with the softess toilet paper in the world welll eating a ribeye steak",1
"very slow paced. controls are clunky. campaign makes absolutely no sense! if a game is not attractive enough to play for free, then its not something i would pay for ever",1
"faningtastic game. it makes my eyes feel like they are ing. im upgrading my pc soon and i honestly cannot wait to play this sex-tastic game on ultra. it just may be the death of me.",1
"fun game, though the combat system takes time getting used to.",1
"arma 3 is the most replayable game ever. its so easy to create your own content, and if you join a clan or just play with some friends you will always have something to do. yes, arma has its bugs; and yes they can be annoying. but the pros just out weigh all of the cons: buy the game.",1
"an amazing game. was able to play it free for a weekend. had so much fun! anyone who can afford it should get it immediately",1
"this is game is the ! best military simulator on the market. check out the patrol ops 3 add-on, its basically a random mission generator that you can play co-op with your friends on your own server.",1
"its arma....... although arma 2 is still better in my opinion. 10/10",1
"my most anticipated releas eof the year! after being an arma 2 junkie for years this fulfills my wishes and brings the arma series to the modern age, also i have to add that this game is probly the most beutiful game ive seen to date. highly modable, sandbox, multiplayer experiance. 10 out of 10 !",2
"if battlefield was ing massive and had teamwork, it would be this game.",1
"best war sim out there as of forever ago and forever on!!",1
"pros - freedom - customization - visive impact - mods & addons cons - still some bug - need optimization would i reccomend this game? hell a lot, hell a lot. this game is hard, requires time and sometimes you need to pass over little problems, but it rocks. a lot of extra-free-content, a lot of mods that change game characteristics, addons, mod for sound, mod for graphics, mod for ai, new maps, new a lot of stuff. really cool simulation. unluckly i cant play this online because i didnt have time, but there is a lot of sp missions and you can create also your own. big community behind. 8.510 reccomend!",1
"this game is hella good you can go from helicopters, jets, boats, submarines, parachutes, on foot... you can do anything that you want freely the choice is up to you. you want too explore you can but... you always must use caution you never know if/when you will be shot at from any direction, any height, any distance and from any type of challenge wether its planes boats, tanks, mines, enemies aka troops and paratroopers you name it.. you can also create missions for you and your friends to play, you can also do anything set on your mind.. but you must follow server rules, if you dont want too be kicked/banned. you can also do solo missions, the campaign, training anything! this game has a ton of mods! so what are you waiting for buy now!!",5
"this game is great. its bugy and clunky but that only adds to its charm. highly mod-able its like 100 games in one. i would not pay 60 for wait for it to go on sale. i got it for 30 durring the summer sale.",1
"great game really enjoyable i reccomend it to any gamer",1
"amazing graphics and amazing sound quality! it is a heavy game but most gaming pcs can run this easily! battle royale for life!",1
"this game is just what you would expect from the bohemia interactive devs, a great game that is fun with a group of friends. you have many recuring mods in the arma series such as island life, wasteland, domination, and even an arma 3 port of dayz, there is even a gamemode only in arma 3 called king of the hill. with the multiplayer basis out of the way what about singleplayer? arma 3 provides a story driven campaign, and a couple of showcases i.e. infantry combat, aquatic warfare, etc. arma 3 is also returning with a more user friendly mission editor/creator, here you can make your own missions that you or some friends can test out, or upload it to the steam workshop. along with uploading you can also download others missions, some serious, some not. but other than that you should have a great time with this game. now for the cons (every game has some) just as expected this game is extremely cpu intensive, and gpu intensive, so if you are getting this game make sure you have a good computer. p.s. fps will be drastically higher in singleplayer compared to multiplayer i.e. sp 45-60 mp 15-30 depending on the server (some are crappy) beware!",1
"important note to all who are having low fps! i was having concecutive fps of 9 so what i did was add this little thing -winxp to my parameters and now i boosted up from 9 fps to 120 fps! that parameter sets your directx to 9 for the game and gives instant fps boost!",4
"if you were looking for a tacticool military shooter that is going to take hours out of your life, look no further, for you have found your game. arma 3 includes: -sleek helicopters -guns of the future -x-ray visioned ai -sleek tanks -an oversized flat map -an undersized hilly map -good multiplayer -and more! squeakers may appear on weekends.",3
"not sure wether to say yes or no really... i mean, i have arma 2 and play it alot, and i like the new graphic yadda, yadda, yadda... but i dont like how hard it is to convert if you play arma 2... yaknow? being use to bullets hitting their marks from an assult rifle from 150 meters away... also some button and vehicles are just wierd and provide no cover at all... u.s. military would never use them... on the topic of vehicles by the way, where the **** are the humvees and hu-1ys?!?!?!?! sorry but i dont have my good chopper or cars... instead i get moon rover crap and guns i never even heard of... i will stick to arma 2 for now and i hope for more modern stuff later in devolpment...",1
"the realisim in this game is intense! this always has my heart racing and puts you right there in on the action. love it great job.",1
"ten times better the arma 2s story to much altis life servers but still a very good game 8/10",1
"this game is great if you want an advanced tactical shooter that is virtualy infinite.",3
"if you plan to have any free time after buying arma 3, forget it, way too addictive. brilliant game. many hours spent so far, many more to come....highly recommend this game 11/10",3
"buyed arma because of my friends. never thought itll be so good. now i have 560h in not even a year. im addicted to it now :p i just started to work on my own map. the possibiltes of this game are insane. koth, epoch, altis life, battleroyal, coop, wasteland. in team we started to create our own little modes, the game is to insane. buy battlefield for 50$ or buy arma for 25$, i can just say arma is better :d",3
"you just cant beat the arma series; gaming at the next level.",2
"i dont even own this game. 10/10 id play it again",1
"this game is all about tactics and fallowing orders great game if you can combine thoose 2 if not go play cod or bf where things are much more simple this game is a simulator.",1
"great game to learn to shoot ppl from long to short distance",2
"i am actually very satisfacted with the changes that boheima has made to this game including things like better vehical sounds better vehical entrance animations reload animations weapon customiastion and more",1
"the perfect war sandbox! anything from small squad assaults to full war! arma3 is one of the few modern games that provides good support for modifications. also the regular updates to the game are really nice. if you want a little slower paced game than cod, with more thinking. this is a good game for you.",2
"thought you could be a soldier? think again! arma 3 throws the player into a near realistic shooter designed to test the best of gamers. a honourable challenge to any and all.",1
"i think this might be the most realistic war game i have ever played :)",2
"if you are looking for a more realistic military sandbox, arma 3 does it right. you can set up all kinds of different combat scenarios in the editor and give it a try in singleplayer or multiplayer. once you have learned how the ai wants to be controlled, it is pretty good. at least the ai can give you a hard challenge on the enemy side, but propperly used it can be really deadly on the friendly side too. multiplayer is best played in a clan where everybody sticks to the plan. but thats the same with most games. but now and then you find little flaws that make you frown. some of them are the players fault caused by lack of experience with the game mechanics or unrealistic behaviour in hot combat zones. but others are real bugs that will be fixed in the future. arma 3 surely has some kind of high-angle learning curve until you fully understand the mechanics. but after that you can have tons of hours of fun. most of the people i know have stacked 200+ hours. at least arma 3 is 10 times worth your money and absolutely worth your time. you should try it. and if you have problems playing it, ask experienced players for help.",3
"best game i have ever played. best and worst game tho. your pc will take a hit from this game in the fps range but over all my fav game",5
"action packed, you can do almost anything imaginable with this game, immersive campaign, the introduction of steam workshop really added to the amount of fun you can have with this game. i personally prefer the rpg (altis life) or sandbox servers. 9.5/10",1
"you can make some really weird  with this game... but hey 10/10 would weird  again",1
"great game, very friendly community and so much variety within the game itself, as well as the mods made by other users like me and you, which believe me are great! the graphics and quality is magnificent for this map size and even player count. some servers have the ability to hold over 100 online players; you cannot get these numbers on any other game as far as im aware. the performance is great on nvidia, however i am not sure it works as good on amd.",5
"a game i would recommend to people since alot of stuff has happend to it over the last mouth or two having some well devloped mods such as epoch, arma 3 life, breaking point and many more mission files you can put hours of game time into",4
"within 24 hours of buying this game, i have played 14.2 hours. im pretty sure its good",1
"ran towards a tank butt naked firing a pistol. got blown to hell.10/10.",1
"arma 3 is one of the best selling fps sandbox games ever made. some of those people come from arma 2 or arma 1 but most people i know, arma 3 was their first arma game. from flying helicopters to infantry rush. arma 3 has a huge community and is still growing today! also not to note the spectacular performance by the dev team update almost weekly. the best thing i love about aroma is there always going to be something new each time you play from altis life to the realism units. friend me if you want to see some screenshots of arma 3 ~macmaster",3
"the most dangerous things in arma 3 are as follows. -stairs -ai -rocks -teammates -the car you are driving -the enemy",2
"its got nowhere near as much content as arma 2 but with an engine thats leagues beyond arma 2s operate hard a",1
"okay im going to keep this simple +graphics amazing imo + multi types of servers all fun from epoch to wasteland ect +amazing fun if you have friends and still fun on your own sneaking up on them and killing them all :0 +love the wep customization ect +prolly my most fav game on steam by far +never fully get bored of it all dlcs are 100% worth con but dont take these into consideration it still a great game -once in awhile you may notice a hacker -maybe the odd bugg but hay it dont ruin it completely",1
"if say you like call of duty, straight into some action, then probably not the game for you, however, forget this games campaign and clunky  controls and go to the multiplayer, give say an invade and annex server a try, trust me, if you are to just follow a group of players, you are bound to have some of the best moments in your gaming life so far.",2
"awsome just awsome good graphics and everything i recommend 100%",2
"this game is the god of all military games. you can not have a better military game, with as much realism as this. the graphics are also amazing. once your done with singleplayer you can explore the vast amount of gamemodes in multiplayer from zombies mods too sandboxes and even bonus campaigns. this game truly has it all.",1
"the improved arma engine really helps the series but many are turned off by the futuristic setting. mods will make or break this one. despite this, it is still the best military simulation on the market focused on infantry combat.",1
"i like this i am far from good at it if anyone plays it hit me up im down for some training",1
"good game, poorly opitimized, but its all about the battle royale. everything else is kinda meh.",1
"played it for about thirty-six minutes, i didnt like it, personally i think its overated, just buy arma 2: operation arrowhead.",1
"you can in salute people like what hey get this game noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwww",1
"gets run over by atv moving at 60 mph, only breaks legs. 10/10",1
"absolute blast not to mention the mod breaking point is so much fun. just buy it! its so much fun",1
"love this game.. enjoyed many hours so far hopeful many more in the future",1
"most realistic shooter i have ever played...and thats a lot.",4
"fun times to be had. ignore all the issues and play the game. when you get down to it killing hapless peasants at range with a 50 cal and thermal optics is just as fun as gunning them down from across the street with a lmg. this game is at its best when you are on your own behind enemy lines with nothing but abdul the condenscending persian and your t-100. you can fire from behind a house or in a hull down position at the backs of unsuspecting armor, infantry, or the occasional aircraft. fall back and repeat while the smoke fills the sky and peasants burn to their horrid deaths. in the end the game has some flaws but thats to be expected in a game this size, regardles of that; i love this game. 9/10 would use as trophy wife.",1
"its a really fun, realistic game that takes up a ton of time. i got really invested in the game and i loved walking through stratis and altis with my team.",3
"this game is very diverse with the mods making it enjoyable for anyone to play stretching from all out war on king of the hill to altis life where you live as a citizen on an the island of altis trying to make a living. very diverse, very enjoyable and would definetly recommend to anyone.",1
"like going to war without having to get in shape 10/10!",5
"endless amounts of fun jsut involve friends and play games like alits life and wasteland",2
"such a good game everything about it is great you should definetly pick it up",2
"played this when it was free. good game. its only 30$ right now and i spent my 50$ buck on reign of kings and civ v cuz i didnt know this was on sale. worst decision of my life. i cant believe how bad i missed this amazing deal. asking any kind soul out there to please gift this to me. it would be much appreciated.",1
"i got to play this game for free as it was one of the free games for the weekend at the time and ive got to say that the experience of war that you get is amazing and would recommend this game to any one who likes role playing games and military simulators.",1
"this game comes with tons of mods you can play like alits life, wasteland, breakingpoint(dayz) and epoch! awesome graphic awesome gameplay awesome realistic! 11/10 tire would blowout with net fence again!",4
"maybe good for mods, but campain looks . maybe not campain itself but ai. ive finished 6 missions so far and all time ive been running behind ai as they never get tired.. then you have  aim etc etc etc. also i hate super duper talks like copy that and other bla-bla. too much of non-sense in simple situations. movement is good",1
"love it! though i wish i had a better graphics card (gt 750m).",2
"for an alpha the game is pretty sweet. a little too much like arma 2 for my liking.",1
"tired of boring unrealistic call of duty and glitchy battlefield? arma 3, the 3rd installment of the famous armed assault series, will serve you beatifully with content updates regularly and a huge community to interact with, arma 3 is a great game to back and is well worth the money!",1
"this is one of the best games that i have ever played i hope you come and join the game its really fun. also the graphics and some more realism into the game from its previous arma 2.",2
"the base game i would give 80/100.....with all the great mods people put together for it i would give it a 90/100. this is due to the fact some of the mods are still.....meh....to say the least. great game overall and highly suggested to realistic shooter enthusiasts.",3
"campaign is a 4/10, multiplayer/mods are 10/10. essentially all the player created stuff is 1000x better than the  bohemia made.",1
"amazing game i have been wanting for a while and well worth the money for arma 3 alone never mind the countless mods that make the game amazing!!!!!",1
"i killed a guy trying to run me over and he outstretched himself. 10/10.",1
"need plenty of peeps with ya when playing to really enjoy",2
"what a piece of , glitchy, unrealistic game! i cant believe they released such a crappy game. the helo flying is horrendous (i am a helo pilot in real life). nothing is easy, specially during the learning curve, tutorails are not there to help you learn but to help you lose your cool and feel like deleting the game. i dont recommend, dont waste your money. if i could i would love to have my money back. disgusting.",1
"fun army simulator game, although i play it for the rpg city life element. its also less buggy in comparison to its predecessor, arma 2.",1
"this game is by far one of the best tactical shooters i have ever played. i love the maps and the way the game feels in the way of how the weapons work, the movement, and the flow of the game just feel amazing.",4
"from my review on arma 2, this is more realistic and of course, better. both games are awesome though. 10 / 10",1
"controls are sloppy and placed terribly.the search for realism has gone to far.btw bohemia we are not actually there to hear where the shots are coming from,and when 1 of 10 guys say enemy front idk wich direction to look.wtf minimap maybe?and most of all since when does a marine run 150 meters before he has to stop from exaustion.this is terrible!!!and finally multyplayer? this is the worst part of the game,not because its difficult but because there is little to no game organization.people just run around with no objective.its all sandbox.and then they add an indipendent team?you never know who to shoot.if you decide to shoot more than 30 meters make sure to rest for 20 min. before you shoot or you will have a gun waving all over the sceen.this game looks and sound awsome but folks im afraid it is a huge waste of money :(",2
"if you are looking for a realistic military sandbox, then look no further than arma 3. from a mission editor that allows the player to create any scenario possible, to an extensive list of community mods and addons, the possiblities are endless. the developers do an amazing job of fixing bugs and fueling all players with new content, and will do so for the next few years for sure! 10/10",2
"really fun game! so many game styles to play, the modding community is fantastic, well worth the price!",4
"bought it, got sucked in, played it for 20 hours straight. earned about a million. lost everything after buying my first expensive truck. tried to earn it back. lost it all while on the way to jewelery store. some s insulted me in voice like little kids with no love. switched serwers, found a stranger and went fishing with him. saved him from 3 robbers, got 150k bounty on me. then another 50k after saving him again. made a deal to get me in jail so that he gets the reward and shares it. went into jail with a sexual nutjob trying to give everyone s and making gurgling sounds in voice chat. 10/10 this game is so messed up... but in an addictive way.",1
"the best war simulator game that i have ever seen, arma 3 is a simulator game that has series and dlcs all around this game. i recommend buying this game when you have played the arma series. arma 3 has a mod that is comming out that is called day z where players have to survive in a world full of zombies and bandits. you can find loot, fight zombies, find vehicles and mostly. fighting bandits. you can trust anyone, but they cant trust you... - stevenisadork",1
"best military simulator out there. its still clunky as hell like arma ii, but we still love it anyways.",1
"pros: -lots of vehicles -very very realistic -downloadable senarios -lots of controls (theres one to even salute and sit down) -a variety of weapons, it just so happens that 95% of the time i have a scar of some sort cons: -ai is terrible and dumb and slow! -shooting someone makes them to some kind of limbo back bending motion, looks really weird (whats up with that) -takes forever to get in the action on multiplayer co-op modes and i mean forever (really frustrating when you finially get on the ground then die or have a dumb pilot that crashes) -cant walk and switch weapons, like really? overall 50/50 but im going to recommend it beacuse a lot of people like it a lot more than i do so maybe youre one of those people",1
"best game i own. 300+ hours. strongly recommend it",2
"amazing! just wow, graphics are so good, its scary, (oh snap! granade!! wait, its just a game! :) ) i am a huge fan of bohemia interactive and codemasters, from operation flashpoint when i was 7 (dont tell anyne :p ) all the way to this beta game, and for this price ( which is steep, but you will never ever run out of missions to create. want to kill a government leader? get a mod of that guy and do it! , and the ai are tough to kill, but if you catch them by suprise they are alot easier to destroy, and no spamming units in warfare will help, its all about strategy, and with the new uavs and ugvs , im suprised the millitary doesnt use it to train their teams, ( would be crazy to even think about that, but we have alot to learn from games... to sum this up in two words? buy it!!!!",1
"its kind of like day z but without the zombies. i dont get it",1
"this game is a true test of skill. fun to play with friends. team work is a must!",1
"large improvement over arma 2, still needs work tho in my humble opinion. and optimisation! rolling it on a mid range system produces less than playable results exactly when you need it to run smoothly the most: multiplayer firefights. theres something inherently wrong with the way you program your game engines guys. probably make a better game engine, one that handles all the stuff it ha to do in a smart way, so you dont need a top of the line pc to play on medium quality! all in all, its worth buying. not going to improve much in the areas it suffers, because they are tied in with the game engine, but as technomogy catches up, it will be fun to play the mods people are making for this, just like dayz was... without the cheaters hehe. props to rocket for that one, but dayz standalone is still a total fail...",1
"your really going to charge people for extra vehicals. the reason i stoped playing battle field is they kept realasing dlc that you had to pay extra for. looks like this game is next.",2
"bohemia interactive made their debut with operation flashpoint and then changed to arma series afterwards. since the first installment it has been downhill up to third one. the engine is heavy, unoptimised, clunky for smooth gameplay no matter what setup you may find for your pc. the menu and ui interface is also archaeic and still as slow as it was in ofp days. i cant see justification for this game unless it would be around 4,90 and even then its not worth your time. the map is boring and unimaginative compared to that of chernarus, sahrani and the multiple locations of ofp. as for gameplay the shooting is well done and the many ways of controlling your character is definitely the best of the industry has to offer. its unfortunate that the teamplay and coordination falls down to its own clunkiness. finally the modding is still there which offers replayability and whatever people come up with to use but still i find the engine and other problems within the core too deep to actually be worth of ones time.",1
"this game is amazing i rate it 10/10 i love the wasteland",1
"yes i love this game! i always get kidnapped! its always a fun way to learn why people kidnap you for cocaine...",1
"extremely fun and a bit of an adrenaline rush at times if you are playing wasteland or koth, recommend playing with a crew and get some comms up for the ultimate experience! i plan to spend more time pew pewing baddies and taking their loot! quite and amazing amount of detail in the game, sometimes im amazed at the littlest things i see in game.",1
"arma 3 is quite a jump from arma 2 and even arma 2 op arrowhead, i have alot of fun playing and the gameplay is much more fluid then arma 2. 8.5/10",1
"a fantastic game which hold countless hours of gameplay and stories and funtimes :dddd",1
"if youre bored of counter-strike: go give this a shot. a slow paced, adrenaline filled, action-packed military shooter.",1
"best military simulator out there. its still clunky as hell like arma ii, but we still love it anyways.",1
"good game and lots of mods so you never get bored breaking point, waste land, altis life just to name a few!!!!",4
"the most realistic shooter on the planet. battle royale mod is the most intense and satisfying game mode ive ever played.",1
"t-bagged someone with only a combat helmet and night-vision goggles. 12/10",2
"features one of the worst aiming systems ever made in a video game (if you manage to kill someone it will be by sheer luck). combine that with piss poor ai, an unnecessarily complicated inventory system, random deaths to invisible landmines and voice acting which is at the level of x-rebirth and you get arma 3. one of the single most unfun experiences of my life and ive seen razorlight live.",1
"highly recommend arma 3 for any fan of shooter games that are looking for much more expansive and open world military games. really fun game to move tactical in with a squad of teammates!",3
"best digital milsim on the market, i recommend it to any one who is in to realistic shooters, the only downside is that to actually play the game how it is intended to be playied you need to have some understanding of the core mechanincs.",1
"this is by far the best millitary sumulator out there and it is highly moddable so you can do almost anything you want",1
"an epic, realistic army simulator! this game is incredibly amazing and stunning as you are playing a role in the army. unlike any other shooter/army games, arma manage to give the player a open-world battlefield. the map is very big, there are a massive range of weapons, outfits, vehicles, helicopters, boats and planes. problems: if you are thinking about buying this game, please be careful, when i bought the game, it shocked me when the game ran at 10 fps at low settings, i had to buy a complete new graphics card in order for it to at least run above 40 fps in medium/high settings.",2
"ever since they messed up and changed the weapon sway the game is ruined. i want a refund, i feel betrayed and hurt.",2
"great game!!! a more adult battlefield 4. good graphics and the best modz ever!",1
"the new features are nice and makes the expiriance better but the game still feel`s like arma2 for example walking aroun still feals like if you are not shure if you whant to move(not fluid). the vehicule physics are still way bad, still feels like a millitary light transport is made out of glass and you also still fall trough staires. whit the really over price dlc that does not fix anything and makes you pay for 2 heli and a arma 2 mod that was better when it was a mod, i recomend this game but only durring the glorius steam sells",1
"extremley fun, extremely low price and a great amount of content, if you liked the previous arma games then its a no-brainer, buy it!",2
"been a battlefield fan for a while then i came upon arma 2 which blew me away and since then have followed to arma 3 and it just keeps getting better and better. maps are big and a big varity of vechicles just need a good eye and switched on and you do fine.",1
"one of my favorite games, it has more realism than any other fps out on the market. yes the physics can be a bit ed but as for actual gunplay and the things that matter are great. arma 2 is the reason i joined the master race lol",3
"this is a amazing game struggle to get bored off this game as there are so many mods you can play. theres day, wastelane, atlis life etc.... the campaign is a struggle and hard to complete. the gun effects and other effects are mint there game is so realistic its unreal rate this game 10/10",1
"bohemia have really stepped up their game. i got this while it was still in alpha. felt like arma 2.5 at that point. come now to the release of survive i cant wait for more. imagine that, the story of a bloody arma game has me engaged as . i am only talking about survive, not multiplayer. this is so much better paced than arma 2 was. graphics (minus far terrain) are brilliant. also of all things, pacing is amazing. when choppers start flying over, it has impact. when a mortar hits nearby, it actually has impact because they are not being spammed. there is an idea of scarcity, and it makes you feel like such an underdog. and that is ing brilliant. the feel of control of your guns fells so much better. the sights are also very nice. many improvements over arma 2. overall so far, this is a massive improvement over arma 2, keep this up bohemia, i am really starting to like you guys",1
"well this is a good game but i got the game to play a mod called atlis life but i guess they added it into the game and i dont know how to play it. :(",1
"if you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. if you dont have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. if you dont have the game to play, get money for it. if you dont have the money for it, get a job. if you dont have a job, rob a bank. if you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.",1
"not really serious about playing this, got it for just $10 in a sale & only really play it for the graphics. very demanding game really need to get into it more.",1
"if youre a fan of open world military shooters then this is probably your best (and only) bet. the amount of content is unbelievable. youll spend hours and hours just with the editor alone. dont like shooters? fine. just spawn a civilian car (or whatever vehicle you want) and take it for a spin. now its suddenly an open world car simulator. thats arma for ya!",1
"better than cod. may strain your computer, your memory (realizm demands many keyboard shortcuts), and your eyesight (is that a rock or is that a sniper trying to line up a shot at my head?). longer multiplayer matches than battlefield (lets retake the entire island with our 30 man team against an actual army). fantastic steam workshop content in the form of car races, single- and multi-player campaigns, and shooting ranges. 9/10.",1
"the most well done military game ive ever seen. the graphics are awesome, the mechanics are awesome, the reality is real and its still on alpha at this point!. plenty of mods. plenty of things you can do in the game. buy it cause its worth every penny.",3
"a very fun and compelling mil-sim sandbox. 10/10. would buy again.",1
"great game, very demanding though, i have a 780ti and i run the game on very high and get 80fps on sp and 30fps on mp. i recomend you play epoch and king of the hill if you like slow pace tactical gameplay, and altis life if you like role playing! i recomend you wait for the game to go on sale, i waited for it to be 50% off",1
"deffinatly recomend this game, ive spent over 800hrs on this and have loved every bit of it!!!!!!!!!!",5
"this is very amazing game! , you guys should buy it !!!",2
"its so real its almost like am actually playing a video game.",1
"worst experiance i ever had. i constantly get kicked from servers for having a high ping, but in reallity my ping is always 80 or below. the game seems fun but, ill never get to find out.",1
"this game is not cod or battlefeild this game is much more then your normal fps it may not have some of the effect that bf4 has with buildings but this is a sirous game if your looking for tons and i mean tons of player abilityies leaning bending 4 different types of stans learning to fly and use different vehicles from start to finish this game takes you through it all can say is play it",1
"pure gold. so much to do in this it turns into a endless adventure. you can play with hardcore relaism people in online co-op or you can cut loose and sell cocaine online with rpg mod servers. so much endless fun it is unbelievable. the one key phrase you must know is f**k the police. thats the essentials in online rpg altis life. personally i like to get into my scuba gear and assault people from the water... but thats just me.",1
"alot of fun if you like role playing servers :d ;)",1
"great sequel to arma 2, i recommend it to anybody looking for a genuine tactical game",2
"if youre getting this because you enjoyed arma 2, then its nothing like it. better graphics, but i feel left down. 7.8 / 10",1
"this game is good, yea? optimised this game is, yea? clunky not tin man like controls easy, yea? more features, yea? prettier looking than game last like arma ii, yea? play hard difficulty high, yea? need do attend to naval academy know to play how, yea? is good!",1
"really great game, or simulator i should say despite the many bugs this game has (which eventually will be worked out), its really fun(if you have a high quality pc if you have a low-end pc you might want to think about upgrading before you purchase it, its a real cpu eater.). one dislike i have is the over-rated, over-played game modes wasteland and altis life but it really isint the game more like the community itself, its sometimes hard to find a good realism game mode with a decent amount of players or decent ping, and more guns could be added too (which are) its quite annoying to have to download a mod for a specific firearm. overall its a great buy, well worth the money",1
"arma 3 was described to me when i first got into it as a military simulation. i can say without a doubt that it portrays a sence of vastness that in my opinion is unmatched compaired with other games that lean into realism. if you are into cod this might not be the game for you. its not particularly fast paced. your going to find yourself on unexpected 10k ruck march from time to time because you were distracted by the scenery and hit a wall and popped the tire on your vehicle. but when the action happens and it will. your going to find yourself in the most intence and realistic firefight you will ever have and you just wont find this expierence in another game. i will say this game has a very steep learning curve. i highly reccomend taking the tutorials and practicing before you enter a server to run and gun. at the time of writing this review i have over 200 hours logged and its still every bit as exciting as it was when i first started to play it. i bought this game on sale but i would happily buy it for full price. it is worth every single cent.",2
"i wouldnt see this as a game, but rather a platform that offers endless expansion. 8/10 for clumsy controlls but good possibilities. (good mods can be found, such as br and bp)",1
"booped a car in the bum with my tank. tank became rocketship, achieved speeds of 1000km/h+. 15/10",5
"just buy arma ii operation arrowhead, dayz mod, and you have a game better than this load of crap.",1
"this game is aiming to be as realistic as possible with everything about war. it tries to concurent battlefield (which concurents call of duty). thats a huge + what counters my positive review is the fact, that on either default or lowest settings my fps cannot exceed 20! you probably should not buy this game unless you have the highest level of the high-end gaming monsters.",1
"this game.... is ing beast no in all seriousness if you like mil sims and want realistic and fun military game this is the game for you.... just make sure u have a supercomputer to play it though 10/10",2
"at first i was like - (   ) but then - (   ) and then a bit after- (   )",2
"i recommend this game because it has roleplayinggame [rpg] and i was joining a fantastic group of friends, made a lot of people who are now my friends.. also when you purchase this game, make sure you get the go-kart dlc, its fun and fantastic. when you join a rpg server, beware of there admins because due to the fact i was randomly killed then got randomly sent to troll island for actually trolling for picking up my things isnt consider trolling as im pretty still new to the game myself. there are 3 type of roles in rpg ; apd [atlis police department] ems [emergency medic service] and civil [civilian / rebel] - i mostly play on apd but after got blacklisted from that, i usually play rebel nowadays. but yeah this game is for men only not little wannabe kids / boys that play battlefield. most of this game features are actually true as in for me, idk bout you guys. recommend to purchase this game! -teamspeak official [tso darklord]",4
"if you like military shooters and realism, this is your game. only complaint is the mp as its not overly optimized at the moment.",1
"armas popularity stems from the fact that its a modern shooter with good modding support. thats it. the game itself is heavily flawed and buggy. bohemia interactives strategy is to exploit the lack of moddable shooters by releasing a half- game and letting the modding community fix it. sure, there will be some great mods for the game but their success shouldnt be attributed to arma. games like battlefield 1942, battlefield 2, and the half-life series were hugely popular due to all the great mods made for them. but the games themselves, without mods, were actually competent. with the shift to catering towards console gamers, modding support has fell by the wayside, and arma, perhaps unintentionally, fills that gap. but arma has horrible ai, horrible physics, horrible performance, a clunky ui, and so on. if arma werent moddable, im confident its metacritic rating would be more like 5/10.",1
"arma 3 is a great game. its the most realistic shooting game i ever played!",1

"can someone please buy arma 3 as a gift to me please :(???? you see, i am very poor and i just cant afford a game like arma 3. i just love this intense game and it has a wonderful sensation. i wish i could just get my hands on it but i dont have the required amount of mey just yet. im just begging anyone out there that is kind to buy me this game as a gift. it would touch my heart deep inside me ;). im crying now as i type. if anyone out there has a heart that is strong enough to be generous i would highly appreciate it :). most people wont listen but it will be awesome. thankyou!!! ;)",1
"good game but the weapons dont impress me i want to see weapons i saw in arma 2 with different gun sounds.",1
"i luv this game it has amazing graphics but there is one problem with playing! that is you need a group of freinds",1
"i love this game 10/10 i love the guns and items and the user interface thats a big plus way better than arma2 why are u reading this go buy it now im going to buy thats for shore 10/10. :)",1
"[do not read negative posts, they are extremely misleading] i went ahead and just bought it with the 50% off sale, and i wouldnt be angry if i had paid 60 dollars for it. it is a top game indeed with so much to do, it is more than a warsim, it is much more than what is advertised...dont think twice, just go get it! its definitely worth it. yes your pc needs to be somewhat good for this to run well but i was scared about this very same issue and turns out it runs amazing in ultra settings for me.",1
"arma three fits into the modern fps category very poorly, its not a bad game its just not cod, a better category would be tfps, tactical first person shooter, cause thats what it is, its also a very fun and challenging game.",3
"abundance of possibilities, consistent gameplay, ongoing development and a great campaign make this game the mostplayed in my steam library. i would definitly recommend the purchase!",2
"waay better than call of duty its awsome. if you love open world milatary games that are realistic buy this game now",3

"it was the best of games, it was the worst of games.",1
"a very nice game alot of mods the altis life mode is the best. i give it 9/10 .",1
"summary: tensions rise as nato peacekeeping forces begin to leave the republic of altis: a strategic fault-line between crumbling european influence and a powerful, resurgent east. but when a key radar facility drops off the grid, a mediterranean flashpoint risks escalating into global conflict. also gameplay: the engine is a big step up over arma 2. things like the adjustable stances, dynamic fog, physics and underwater terrain add tons of possibilities in the game. setting: this is one of my major problems with the game. sci-fi and simulation dont mix well. while i know that everything in the game is possible, the fact remains that most vehicles and weapons are pure speculation. the equipment not being used in present day armed forces partly kills the immersion for me. hopefully ace mod will fix this. sp content: the campaign (so far) is awesome. bi managed to improve the storytelling and the gameplay as well as the realism. mp: performance in mp can be horrible, depending on the gametype and server. i dont often find populated servers with interesting gametypes, as there only seem to be 2 popular gametypes on public servers. collapse",1

"almost 40 hours into the game and i can honestly say its the best game ive purchased on steam, amazingly fun, action packed and a lot of things to do, never gotten tired of it and ill continue to play it until i find another game as funny as this one.",1
"best milsim on steam, but needs a few mods to really shine",1
"best game ever it is really fun doing the altis life.",1
"easy to get lost in this world.... love the game and fantastic missions/ mods available",3
"insanely boring. after the first few days of playing, i finished the campaign and went into multiplayer. once you finish the campaign, there is absolutely nothing to do, because nearly every server on the multiplayer is either broken or the same thing as the last one.",1
"enjoy a challenge? enjoy frustration, enjoy sucking, enjoy dying, enjoy never getting good, enjoy trying, enjoy failing, enjoy being determined to fail some more? then enjoy. maybe one day ill enjoy all of it. for now ill honestly say i wish i hadnt bought the game and dlc, even on sale... id like to step away from this game instead of force myself to get into it. but im 40-50$ in to deep, gonna try a couple more times",1
"great game. awesome alternative to battlefield 3, if youre looking for a slower paced more tactical game experience. amazing visuals tempt me to lose track, and just fly around the map, to just explore. the main map of altis has over 200km of shoreline, with over 270 square km of map space. (arma 2, chernarus was 225km2) with the new lighting and physics added to the engine, night conflicts are no longer a pain, but great to play. ragdoll physics in the game are tastefully done, in my opinion. i recomend this game, the addition of the ease of modding, makes this game perfect to tailor to your perfect prefrences.",2
"arma 3 is an amazing game! this game is great for anyone who likes shooters or rp games. this game is one of the best first person/3rd person games i have ever played. i have played arma 2 and i have to say arma 3 is so much better than arma 2. the only problems about this games that really game to my attention is... first off glitches, theyre not too bad but they can get annoying every now and then. also servers is a big problem, there arent many servers out there for a variety of gamemodes, the ones that i commonly see is deathmatch or battle royale, breakingpoint, king of the hill, and some others, but other than that this game is really fun and an enjoyable experience for players that are new or old to the 1st/3rd person shooter genre. i really recommend you get this game, especially if youre coming from arma 2 or even battlefield. thanks! i hope i helped you out!",1
"this game is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo eipc make more update best game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",3
"you cant jump into this game expecting to do anything well. arma 3 isnt a game in the traditional sense; its a platform and sandbox for military scenarios. arma 3 is made to be flexible; it can be anything you make it to be. expect the meat of the experience to be in community-made missions and multiplayer, but the featured campaign isnt too bad. a lot of military enthusiasts and veterans appreciate armas more true-to-life simulations of weapons and military tactics. only recommended for people who is willing to spend the first 10 hours into learning(struggling, actually) how to proficiently control your character. once you succeed, the possibilities arma offers are numerous. at $30 during the holiday sales, it is well worth the money.",2
"arma 3 and 2 is the best war game i have ever played it is like my number one favorite game",1
"it is a combat simulator. just be aware of that. it is not a battlefield 4 type game. steep learning curve for sure. tough to master but if you do boy its a great simulator.",2
"they say its the best combat simulator and say it has the best physix, well to tell you the truth its absolute , very glitchy, annimations are , and how is it you cant jump, shots dont register half the time, and flares do almost nothing to defend against anti air, somehow i cant pull myself away from the fact that i feel like im playing a beta, this game is not worth 60 dollars, hell its not even worth 30 dollars, how can they put out this garbage and say its the best. 1/10",3
"if you like awesome army stuff then multiply by 100 = arma3",1
"at first watching trailers for arma 3 i was not impressed, i have never liked futuristic games but as soon as i finaly picked this game up i loved it. so much you can do compared to arma 2, like the work shop, you can load custom missions and i love how you can change gun attachments. if you are unsure i would highly advise you to buy this game. may not look like much, but believe me it is.",1
"arma is how my hubby convinced me to join the pc gaming community. couldnt say enough good about it! cant wait to see how it evolves over the next few years. :)",1
"starting to hat arma 3 beacause i every time i try downloading it wont download and dev dont even respond to you!",5
"arma 3 does a good job at improving many aspects that were lacking in their previous versions. most notably, in my opinion, is the ability to dive underwater without dying. helicopter flight dynamics seem to have improved, although they are still not realistic. i would like to see vortex ring state (now implemented with helo dlc, thanks!), limited power during hot/heavy/high altitude operations, and a wider ability to slingload realistic loads (partially implemented in helo dlc, thanks bi!) into battle.",1
"i bought this game with the hopes that it would be an awesome realistic war simulator, it didnt go the way i thought. i wish that steam could let reviewers to choose a neutral option instead of thumbs or down. arma 3 is a really nice game, but also a bloody glitchy one. the game is quite enjoyable so far, but it requires lots of updates to make it even more enjoyable. to give an example of this is that some of the physics in this game are completely illogical! an example is a sports vehicle, you touch a single rock or tree on the road you can say goodbye to your wheels or hull, because the car seems to be made of paper, but when someone shoots your car, it takes like 3 clips to explode it. there are many glitches in this game that destroys the fun i have at some points, and i really hope they fix that soon. in other words, if you intend to buy arma 3, i recommend you to take it with a grain of salt, it would be better if you bought it in a discount.",1
"best game na. like get this game it will change your life, it has an awesome military simulation. :d",1
"arma 3 is an amzing game. if you owned arma 2 and experienced terrible fps, then this is the game for you. they amazingly increased the fps in the game, and it has amazing graphics.",1
"found server. got drivers license. run over dude. gets banned for vdm. 10/10 would vdm again.",1
"10/10 best walking simulator on the market, would walk again",4
"a difficult game with a bit of a learning curve with all the controls. fun, but multiplayer can be a pain in the  on the rpg servers. to many kids and people who dont care/cant speak english. sort of disapointed where my money was spent yet again. feeling disapointed with fpss as of recently.",1
"joined into an altis life server. looked at a guy the wrong way. he shot me in the leg. i shot him in the face. got banned for life. 10/10 would shoot that  again",3
"meh, its good. allows for some fun on gamemodes such as king of the hill and wasteland. but, arma 2 for life.",2
"arma 3 combines graphics and gameplay of a great modern war simulator. great buy for anyone even for the price. mods are endless and easily accessable through the steam workshop. overall great buy and suggest this for any casual or diehard arma fans, and any fans of shooters in general.",1
"this game packs a level of detail and immersion not common in games these days. the scale is enourmous and there is something in here for everyone. plus, the modability and community activity promises a long lifespan. just like its predecessors!!! there are not many games like this these days, but bohemia has spoiled us with one every couple of years!",2
"after the update with the launcher arma and bisudio can go to in hell i uninstalled the game and hope they burn up in hell",4
"extremely awesome and getting better all the time. :)",1
"this is a damn good and realistic game. very good war simulator and graphics are awesomeness when they are at high and when graphics are set to ultra or better they are fantastic! this is one of the best games i have played!",1
"wow... when i bought this game i thought that i was going to play it like 1 hour or so. but now that i bought it, im addicted. it has endless gamemodes. maybe its expensive, but its worth it.",1
"best war simulator out there. needs a lot of polishing though! also it feels a little alien with all the futuristic weapons. would have been nice with present weapons. luckily there is a very active modding community that is very skilled. a most have game in my opionion.",5
"this game is amazing, so far its the best game all around i have played. it has amazing graphics, lots of differant simulations, and endless replay value. the main campaign is not part of the game at launch, but is a free dlc in 3 differant installments. the fact you can play this game in first or third person, increases the amount of people this game can apeal to. the learning curve is a little rough, but after a few times running around doing missions or just playing around, its super easy to pick up. again graphics, a++ if you dont have this game yet, its worth the money, i got the game during alpha, i got one for my wife in beta, and now the full games out, and it just blows alpha and beta away with how amazing the game turned out to be.",1
"not for the weak hearted. seriosly, i sat on a rock observing for 7 hrs. not fun. overall great game.",1
"downright the best military simulation game ever.....its a must play game highly recommend",2
"while there are still a few bugs, it really is a great game, much better than arma 2. highly recommended!",1
"very good game and love it even more with the mods that i have put on it",1
"love this game id love to see some dlc for sasr or commandos! i recomend this to all my mates!",2
"what has made this series so popular is the ability to mod it. the game by itself (talking about arma 2 and arma oa) are terrible games, but i have 100s of hours playing the modded versions of them, particularly the ace mod. since ace is not out for arma 3, and no sign of when it may come out, i cannot in good conscious recommend this game to anyone. the arsenal available in vanilla arma 3 is miniscule, and they have recycled a lot of graphical stuff from arma 2, making this worthy of the $20 shelf, not the current $60 price point. in summary, with ace out i would pay $60 for arma 3 today. without ace, only 2 maps, 2/3 of a campaign out, and no real game improvements coming from bohemian i would wait until this game gets to $19.99. update 22 july 2014. i can finally recommend this game again, since there are enough mods out there to once again make this game great. bi makes a poor game, the modding community makes it into a great game. while ace is still not out, there are other mods coming forward such as agm that make this game great. the weapon sway is completely broken without mods. as of this writing it is still $60, which is more than i would pay. pick this up on a steam sale for $30 or less.",2
"solid purchase, tons of mods, community is great. every installment from arma 2 to this is great.",2
"great game. definitely not your average shooter, as you really need to know what youre doing otherwise you will not succeed.",1
"a rocky start but got of to be a great game after a few months. when the game first came out and i got it i wasnt convinced, the campaigns being added gradually was a bit annoying and it had a lot of bugs, now though its a great milsim and a good sequen to arma2, the multiplayer is great fun with lots of possibilities including the zeus mode, which is like an rts. recomended, really fun game.",1
"if youre thinking about getting this game, get it! i have 38 hours at the time of writing this review, and i have enjoyed every last second of it. pros: beautiful game all the mods good fps elements cons: can be glitchy sometimes, but most of them are pretty hilarious kick @$$ graphics make the game hard to run this is the best mil sim on the market, i have well over 400 hours in arma 2 and plan to have more in this",1
"i dont know how to get in to severs it kicks me out all the time why ??",1
"the only game series which is progressing from installment to installment instead of degrading.",1
"this game is the ing best !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",4
"this game is so good fun but dont count on the campaing that is just",1
"i cant connect to any of the servers. the game actually crashes my internet completely. it appears i need to buy a new router/modem. im really disapointed.",1
"if youre sick of battlefield 4 and are still waiting for the good maps to be released: buy this. this game is incomplete, buggy and frustrating at times. you will feel right at home from battlefield, attempting to figure out how to ask for help or where the enemies are shooting you from. as for hackers: this game has partial hacker support (aimbots are incompatable). the fun is not killing, its attempting to organise, get from the base to the ao without dying or crashing you vehicles and smashing helicopters into the object you were attempting to pick up.",2
"i go to war with in my underwear every day...10/10",1
"the game is just amazing if you like arma 2 you will definitely like arma 3. if you never played that game get it now, you will enjoy it for sure, the simulation is good but not perfect since sometimes he have obstacle that normally in real life you will be enable to do,but you cant in arma 3.but yeah 1 thing is annoying is the crash sometimes you can get in arma 3. let me explain my experience when i started for the first time the game. first i open my game i go in multiplayer,and i join a server. all my keys where messed up, so i had to keybind everything after 15mins, i was almost done but i get hit by a car and die and my game crash. so yeah 10/10 would get bump and crash again!",2
"this game is awesome i love it its so realistic and everything so i will continue playing this game cause it is to awesome alright :)",1
"this is a great game it has beutiful graphics good gameplay. it makes me fell like im actuall in a real war.",1
"dear bohemia you guys made a nice game, yes. the cons are easily noticable, starting witrh the beta ready engine, (we all know this but still love it) the fact that youre money farming people for helos dlcs and seeing if it works. the fact you pander more for the life community side this time than the core fans. but hey, you take what you can get. its still a good game if you can find a good unit to play with, and mods. games legit worth is about $39,99 usd without the modding community. i recommend this if you are someone who has a vast majority of free time playing army barbie or just a kissless virgin who never touched a woman and spends it playing out a simulation of a real life. if youre a core fan. dont bother 90% of core servers are hosted on 4gb of ram",4
"well, every single fps is  compared to arma iii. just. this.",1
"verdict: good reasons: on its own the game is a small disapointment from what we would come to expect from bohemia. stating this i would like to mention that the game is not even close to being a bad game the standards where just set very high. the game allows tons of mods about all kinds of things. this game is nothing near cod so you cod fanboys that do nothing else than cod please dont ruin this game for others. overall the anti hack system is prety good. this game requires a lot of team work so dont even think about being a stingy player it wouldnt benifit you. im not the best in reviews but i hope this helped someone",4
"as coming from arma 2 and what it gave was out-standing. arma 3 atm gives alot to do from player made missions to mods. with time to come am sure this game will grow. the only downside is the fps lag and servers with lots of plug-ins and player count. overall this is a great game and if you are fan of arma, battlefield or just looking for a game to buy i recommend this (10/10)",2
"this game is a must have if you like milsim. it is very realistic, and has a great community. wasteland is for those who enjoy killing everyone in sight even if they are wearing the same camo. deathmatch is meh. coop missions are some of the best game modes. if you are new to the series, check this out, the controls are a little strange at first, but you will grow to love them.",3
"i want a refund! this game is riddled with bugs and even if you spend thousands on a pc you still wont be able to enjoy it.",1
"a lllllllot better than arma and arma 2 the game play and performance has improved, but still kind of a rage game especially when ai on normal can headshot you from 500 meters away with an assult rifle with red dot sights(ultra realism huh?) also you still die in like 3 shots",1
"arma 3 is the most pure pc game in the world. 10/10",1
"such a great game, espescially online, if you love the realism in games then youre going to love this futuristic military game, even though you might need a good pc, the fun is still unbearable",1
"possibly the worst game created so far, even compared to really  indie titles. this game was never optimized for a computer from the look of things. if you run intel anything youll be fine, but god forbid that you run amd youll get 0-20 fps no matter what situation. the developers for this game are autistic  who have clearly never cared for gameplay in anything, sure you can argue its a simulator, not a game but its still a military simulator. there is no effort for gunplay whatsoever in this torm of a simulator. all the guns feel the same, bullets never connect where theyre supposed to, you run around feeling clunky as  shooting nerf guns at nothing. tl;dr pros: its a game cons: its a really  game low/nonexistant fps  gunplay models are ugly server list sucks just about every game out there is better than this , and thats terrible seeing as theres a full dev team that made this. just take your $60 and spend it elsewhere, thats all there is to it.",1
"well am an arma 2 veteran i was skeptical on getting the 3rd game of the series and man am i sad to say this game is a blow to the series while there are many new things that do look and feel rather amazing most of the content was cut out by the devs due to unknown reasons,lack of weapons,vehicles,maps and general content makes the game feel rushed and unfinished. i have been there since alpha and yet not much honestly has changed i think the creators let this game slip with intention since little information is given about new content from the community managers and devs themselfs making this just another generic ocd/add combat shooter. it may best to say wait 5 years until most of the content will be added by the fanbase and community modders . . .",1
"best friggin game ever. been playing arma 2 for years now. will play arma 3 for years to come. if there is an aspect about this game you dont like, then theres probably a mod for that! seriously, check out mods like arma 3 life, epoch or breaking point. arma 3 is not just a fun game by itself, but the mods make this any gaming experience you want it to be. if you like fps, this is really the only game you need!",1
"i must say this is simply the best shooter out there with so many user created contents like sandbox environment, persistent player stats apart from the normal pvp and co-op game mode. arma 3 is much more optimised than the prior version. best immersive gaming experience like you felt when first time played ops flashpoint: cold war crisis.",1
"really nice game.. beautiful aswell. just the campaign made me rage xd",2
"true battle simulator 2014 when you want it to be, but also a hint of rpg. obviously by a hint i mean the ~1000 altis life servers running right now. love this game, its my most played game. king of the hill, battle-royale, wasteland, breaking point, and countless life type servers make this a great game for programmers and players. worth the $60 i didnt spend for it. *cough* bought it *cough* reatil. *cough*",2
"one of the most astonishingly open-ended games i have ever played. the sheer scope, diversity and flexibility of content packed in this game is completely and utterly mindblowing. this game and its predecessors stand and laugh at all those other games calling themselves realistic, and shows them how to get it done. twitch reflexes dont win here, player cunning and coordination does.",2
"i dont know what to say, it isnt ing optimized  you bohemia interactive gud stuff though otherwise like shooting controls are ed too though as any other arma. too many. 8.1/10 would lag again",1
"decent game but rather shabby compared to arma 2, devlopers cud of done much better stuf but decided not to i cud of done much better job",1
"this is the first arma game ive played, the first milsim acctually, and its great ive been looking for a game like this for a while.",1
"this game is great combines between fps and simulation, in a realistic environments it got everything a game needs, starting with the amazing graphics, sounds, ambient effects, everything gameplay is great, & steam workshop got some of the best mods youll ever imagine, great game, a must have.",3
"best military simulation out there. huge modding community, wit hthat comes lots of content. the multiplayer is very bugged because the performance depends on the server you play",1
"running around aimlessly through miles of durka-durka land squinting your eyes for multiple hours trying to find something that moves. once you do, you find out that you need to reload your gun and you get shot a million and a half times. i like this game. it is fun.",1
"arma 3 is a really good game. if you feel like a real army game, go and play arma, good tactics etc makes your team win. for the roleplayers out here, they are also at the right addres, arma has an rp mod called altis life this is fantastic for people who love rp with good graphics. i really recommend this game for actually every player who loves an army game and for people who seek real roleplay",2
"my favorite steam game! many free mods (altis life, wasteland, hostile takeover, breaking point, etc) we play @",5
"one of the best games ever. this game has been made better with modding community adding various gamemodes and other fun things. buy it!!",1
"please rudse the price of arma 3 to 24 again so i can buy it for all my mates arma 3 is so fun to play when you have got some friends on the game to its just greate i think everyone should buy it when it goes down price of coruse :d",1
"best opensand box,shooter,reallife game for pc out there!",3
"i think it is the best game around and i baught it for how good it is i give it a 100/100 its the best",1
"this is a really really great game and worth every penny, very enjoyable with friends.",4
"great gameplay, great graphics, great multiplayer, great community, great game.",1
"this is one the best combat simulators ive ever played. the sand box on here is a blast and the steam work shop is awesome for user created content. the only down fall for me is that i dont have anyone to play this with.",2
"the most complex and realistic tactical military shooter ... once ghost recon went down the tubes after ghost recon 1 this filled the void for me and gets allot of my attention and game time :)",1
"shit i just paid 60$ for this game and now its on sale. . steam plz refund",1
"you dont need it anymore theres a standalone for dayz",1
"great game really fun with a group of people and if they try to play it serious its almost seems like you r in there.",1
"great looking game altho it has probably the worst control setup of shooter i have played. after 30 minutes of trying to figure out how to walk and turn trying different key configurations i gave up.",1
"worth getting! even if you only like arma 3 altis life :)",1
"the only thing in the known universe more addictive than heroin.",2
"great game lots of new content constantly from the steam workshop and great graphics for a mil sim! only thing that drags it down is the slightly wkward controls but other than that you learn to cope with them.",3
"best game i`ve played ever.soooooo many missions & addons. highly recommend for keyboard commando like me!!!!",2
"this is by far the worst campaign i have ever played. the only fun mission is the first one, the second one is absolutly horrible. you have to get to a camp in 10 mintues but there are 50 ai that are pro shots that will kill you instantly. oh yea i forgot to mention, there are ied/ landmines everywhere. the multiplayer is alright, i can only get in about maby 3 servers out of 200 update: i really like this game after playing it bunch. still the campaign sucks but the senarios are pretty cool. multiplayer can be fun if you get a good server. i like playing on patrol ops. anyways i give campaign 3/10, multiplayer, 8/10",1
"great game ! its a must buy for everyone who has some time on their hands !",3
"remarkably well put together as bohemia games go! i only noticed two serious game play  ups: the ai twice ( in my entire 40 hour playthrough) decided to just sit in a house and play dominos rather than follow me into battle. beautiful game, the sound and your vulnerability makes every firefight an intense one, and close quarters stuff is just amazing. the thrill of getting the drop on the enemy ai ( which is a tough son of a  at the best of times) is great.",1
"this is a good game if you have friends to play it with otherwise prepare to get demolished constantly if your a casual player like myself !! this game needs a lot of work it just feels empty however i do love it ! it runs better on a mid range laptop then arma 2 does and i appreciat that. if your into a tactical army sim like arma them go nuts i just think you need a friend or two to play with any way have fun !!!!!!!",1
"the sheer scale of the maps. the roles its crazy though villanlia is alright. get a few mods installed and you can have alloooot of fun with it. this is the only milsim game ik that does a milsim better, though their are alot buggs i heard at least i persoanly have only ran into cliping issues. but its pretty good at the end of the day.",4
"this game is fun but god it en crashes so god damn much i dont think ive ever played a full online game without the game ing crashing its a glitchy  online and i want to strangle the developers cause this  aint playable online. but singleplayer is well made and fun. i have well qualified specs for this game.",2
"worth 20 just for the eye candy, and still only an alpha!!!!!",2
"if it would get a better engine i will recommend it. but it is fun only you got sometimes (in battles) huge fps drops etc. fun game, have like 250hours in the game or something, dont know xd",2
"just another arma. same bugs (with a bunch of new ones), same gameplay, same problems, same game. absolutely worth buying for anyone who fell in love with tactical shooters (any of the ofp, arma series or bf2: project reality). and not recommended to anyone else.",1
"very nice game got a bunch of options for game mods",1
"arma died with the influx of wasteland and dayz deathmatch players. bohemia a once community friendly company seems to gone the way of greedy developer once they got a taste of the dayz and dayz standalone money. $66 for a digital download of a nearly 2 year old game? $17 for 2 choppers????? seriously?",1
"what the alpha has shown so far is amazing, i cannot wait to see what continues with the full game. definitley worth the price, buy it now.",1
"if you are the guy who love act of valor, black hawk down or lone survivor kinda movies, then this game is for you!",1
"seriously i had never played any game from bohemia interactive until arma 3. and only reason why i bought this game was that is developed by czech studio and i wanted to support them. so i tried it and guess what... i found the game very, very interesting. even when there wasnt any campaign, there was an editor (key feature of arma 3). in there you can create your own missions. and whats the best? you dont even have to be much skillfull. the editors interface is very friendly. only few minutes are enought to familiarize with whole process how to create a mission. if i take to account beautifull graphic and very deep done almost every detail in huge map (biggest you can ever seen in any game before), i can only say if the community stay so awesome how its now (modders, mission creators etc.) game have big potential be best fps military shooter in singleplayer and if you find good people for cooperation the second best in multiplayer. (the king of whole genre is still and will be battlefield.) 7/10",1
"a good sequel from arma 2, with even easier mission making and better performance. and the best is even that steamworkshop works great and it still has mods (not many games out there that support mods) only still, the system requirements are quite high, but if you can run it, you should buy it. (with friends)",1
"very fun lots of game modes and had lots of fun using editor great game if you love tatical games and teambased and vey realestic sorry bad english",3
"nvidia gtx 780 = $800 asus 24 1080p monitor = $300 playing on all lows and still getting 10fps = arma 3",1
"this is one of the most amazing games i have ever played. all of the stuff that were obnoxious and annoying are fixed in arma 3. i totally recommend it!",1
"this game is a lot of fun, especially with friends. once you get tired of arma 3 you can download the mods - breaking point, battle royale and others make this an epic title. this game has pissed my wife off because i play it so much! 10/10 would piss my wife off again.",2
"awesome game, fluid graphics, perfect for creating a battlefield set for a group. the only downsides are the small equipment, etc., but thats if you compare it to arma 2, which had 3 dlcs and an expansion; and also if you dont mind small bugs and glitches due to just classic arma physics :p. any vet of arma(people whove played previous releases in the series) will say that there are bugs, but the gameplay exceeds the bugs :) best part about it is that theres less 10 year olds than cod or bf >:d",3
"this is the best game i have ever played. most of the people are very nice and will be glad to teach you the ropes.",1
"i wish it was still free ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((",1
"10/10 i got headshotted by ai using iron sights at night, no nvgs, from 300 meters while i was behind some bushes.",2
"alot like arma2, graphics and some very slight phisics updates. though these games usually improve with age.",1
"i love this game, spent many hours into various kinds of game modes from alpha to release. i have played many singleplayer maps which i have gotten from the workshop, some i have spent countless of hours restarting over and over again, just to enjoy it a little bit more. and some i have played with my friends in various fun co-op missions. i have played various multiplayer modes from wasteland, king of the hill, to altis life. i have had my moments of rage, and i have had my crazy ammount of laughter. if you like a good fps game with a great ammount of depth and lots of replayability, then this is a game for you. if you like to sit on a hill far away from the combat sniping down on the unknown enemy soldiers, then this is a game for you. if you enjoy commandering a group of troops, hell, even a whole army in battle, then this is a game for you. or if you just want to do illegal drug business while avoiding cops in altis life, then this is a game for you. i feel repetive now, but i really enjoy this game, and hope you do so too. sorry if there is any grammatic errors in the text, english is not my native language.",2
"the server browser sucks , it cuts out your internet everytime you refresh the list of servers and the game is poorly optimized, but once you actually get into the game it is a lot of fun.",1
"cool game , but at the same time need powerfull pc and some mods are weird !",1
"severely underated game. even with its growing popularity, its still overlooked by many many people. trying to get my friends to play it is a chore, probably because theyre too pansy to make any effort to get through the learning curve.",1
"shot a guy from 600m with a katiba with a rco scope 10/10 ign for fun.",3
"great game id pay $100 for this! its a must buy if you like real life type shooters.",3
"this is not your typical shooter, it is more of a simulation game with firefights usually at football feild lengths away unlike the close quarter battles in cod or moh. this is not a shooter with tightly scripted fights and cynimatic bravado, it is a sandbox game in the truest sense of the word especially with the games support of the mod community. if you have basic scripting knowledge or patience then the game opens new possibilities with the fantasic mission editor that alows you to set up single and multiplayer firefights in minutes. lastly the multiplayer is fun though i find multiplayer is better at a smaller scale with friends on custom missions though if you can get into a warefare game it is a lot of fun playing a large scale realistic rts/fps.",1
"11/10. one of the best military sims out there (in my opinion.) plus the controls are better compared to arma 2. :p",1
"the game is great, but when i try to host my game crashes!!",5
"i won a firefight in the middle of the night chilling out in limeri bay and it lasted 3 hours 10/10",1
"a very good game,still needs some work on it. i love the arma games and this is the best yet. keep up the great work guys.",4
"seemed slow, very slow compared to other games i have played but, well, i think it could get interesting. only played a small bit during free weekend but, if cheap enough, i would probably buy it. i know it says i only played 0.8 hours... that is all the free campaign lasted... but it gives you a good feel for the game.",1
"huge disappointment, lack of content, no jets, no campaign (later as free dlc - what a ...). imo arma2/oa still beat a3.",1
"hardware requirements are rediculous. i can run most other games well on medium or high visuals. on arma 3 i can only manage to squeeze 9 fps servers lag like  buy it in a decade from the bargain bin. youll be able to run it then",2
"300 game crashes per second when trying to join every server.",1
"one of the most realistic games i have ever played. this is very challenging, but a little hard to learn. there are tutorials, and i would greatly recommend playing through them all. the helicopter expansion is just the , the helicopter is a beast in this game, and i had a lot of fun learning how to fly it. i have yet to learn how to actually get one in gameplay, but again, i imagine this game takes a really long time to get used to. the controls are a little wonky sometimes though. i am not sure if it is because i havent learned all of them yet, but i find myself in menu that i dont know how to get out of, or not being able to quickly take aim and fire. the game does support my xbox360 controller though, however, by using it i lose some functionality. some vehicles/equipment require more manipulation than my controller has buttons. i dont have any doubts that i will eventually figure it out, but if you have friends that are already in the game, i would recommend teaming up with them to learn about it. great game if you are a fan of realistic and difficult combat.",1
"this game is what pc gaming is all about! arma 3 da beast!",5
"a great game with many different ways to play! a wide variety of community and official game modes and mods exist for arma 3 that will keep you coming back for more. the campaign/single player really isnt anything special, but the graphics are on point. play with friends to get the most enjoyment! all in all, 8/10 would recommend!",2
"this is a really good game with amazing graphics. best to play with friends and to communicate.",1
"realy good game looks stunning plays realy well the only down side i can say is the lack of air and land vehicles for that reason i would give it a 8/10 if it had the list of stuff like arma 2 it would be an easy 10/10 for me :)",1
"a great simulator of my home country, alpacastan. i appreciate the correct modelling of alpacastanians, and there wonderful law-enforced attire of blue striped shirts, hats, tan shorts, and sandals. i also love the fact that you can recreate traditional alpacastanian picnics within this great simulator. it always brings tears to my eyes to remember the death of my grandfather, backwards cap guy- he was hit by a car, and then shot by a spy during the great cleansing of stan. rip, he will be missed. 11 frolicks out of 10.",3
"very nice gameplay 10/10 would reccomend, very fluid controls and gameplay",1
"the best military sim game to date. nothing compares to the realism and strategy this game offers. with all the great single player games in the steam workshop you dont have to join an online clan to enjoy this game, although it really shines as a multiplayer. expect a fairly steep learning curve when coming from other shooters, especially when getting into mission building and mods. once you get used to this game you will wish you had its freedom in other games.",2
"easily one of the best military simulators on the market. if youre a fan of arma 2. youll be a fan of arma 3. although the game has slight optimization issues it overall doesnt effect the game drastically. highly recommended a beefy/above average computer before buying. side note wish the games flight aspects were made more realistic. good military sim recommended. 8.5/10",2
"to be honest i might go for arma 2 this time, i dunno i think it has more... besides its cheaper, and it has dayz as well, nice community (both actually), but there is something arma 3 has never came up with..... bikes, man i use bike as weapons here, real talk... what are you going to do when you are out of ammo!?, i till what to do, use a bike simple as dat, deadly yet, convenient.",1
"i dont know if i did not give this game enough time or not, but from what i have played i hate it lol.",1
"all i can say is that this game is amazing. i think its better than the previous armas and has a pretty damn good story to go with it",1
"got banned for calling someone, who had no life and were just chilling at the noobtown, son of a  on an altis life server. no admins are able to understand fun. 10/10 would definitly recommend",1
"man, doe be like comin out of the trees and , and you be all like oh mayne, who hims that? you that and your team all like nah, it aint me, but it do and you like yah, it do and then you both shoot him and , people droppin all around, man with helichopter come in all shootin missiles and , blowing up children and you like yah, but there is the cav and everyone else dying, but you not. nah, you not.",1
"i like the campaign so far but everytime i try and join a mp gmae it wont let me and i dont know why. i really would like to play mp but i cant so im losing out on alot of content :(",1
"one of best experiences in multiplayer in my life. most of times i do mil-sim coop so this game is worth all money if you dont expect cod or bf like gameplay",2
"arma 3 is fun if you have friends to play it with. plus thiers a wide vairity of mods such breaking point that can enhance your arma experiance. buy it on sale and have fun!",3
"arma 3 is living from multiplayer. you can have so much fun playing king of the hills, altis life, battle royal, breaking point, epoch (will come hopefully in the future), ... the singleplayer campaign or the scenarios are good (scenarios are pretty goof to learn the controls of the game, if you havent played any arma before), but you will spend more time online. if you like cod, bf, ... you maybe dislike arma, because it is no arcade action game, but i personally love it, because it is so realistic. its definitly a slower game than the mentioned other games, but thats an advantage in my opinion. rating: 9.5/10",1
"one of the best military sims ever created. amazing true-to-life graphics and a real sense of peril -coupled with one of the largest modding communities of any game means this will never get old. i must buy for any military shooter/sim.",1
"10/10 i have probably spent too much time in this game! the game has so many areas to it so there is always more to do. for example, there is rp mods, dayz like mods and even servers like ctf. it is so much fun and it is a total must have!",2
"ing attriociuos game, spend an hour running to get shot by a bush biggest joke of a game ever. its not even ing finished it looks horrible and runs horrible but thats what u should expect biggest no way bohemia would optimise the game even slightly. i can run crysis 3 settings maved out completely solid 70fps i run this  piece of a game at 30 at max and when i change the settings to as low as possible i get 20fps. what the  kind of  are you making finish your ing games. the only reason this  house company is still around is because of ing dayz and that is even . awful game 0/10 for effort -100/10 for not giving a   you.",1
"needed to get to a battle. player flys squad out to a strategic overwatch position. pilot doesnt know how to land. flips helicopter and plows us into the ground. ok respawn. still need to get to battle. different player flys squad to a strategic overwatch position. pilot also doesnt know how to land. barrel rolls into a treeline. weve been playing for 45 minutes. 10/10 no but seriously, amazingly deep military sandbox.",1
"a game about being a soilder who falls through the floor 10/10 would fall through floor again",1
"i love this game, has great mods to it as well. you will need a good graphics card to play it.",1
"although i cant get past the first checkpoint, or get a single kill in the first 2 hours, dont let the difficulty baffle you as there is a lot more out there that meets the eye. not only does arma iii offer you a ginormous sandbox openworld map, it gives you a range of choice between vehicles, weapons and body gear. the intense graphics allow magnificent details which give you the best experience possible of what its like being out in there in the field. as you slowly immerse deeper and deeper into this game, past reminiscences of other fps shooting games from series such as the call of duty and counter strike will fade. however there are still some noticable glitches and bugs but these defects barely affect your gameplay and only give the creators more urge to make this game even more fantastic than it already is. the arma series has really opened the gates to a bridge that connects man to virtual reality and i highly recommend people to buy this game as it is a should buy -- no, must buy game on the steam store.",1
"a great well rounded military sim, a very good game has graphics of jesus juice, it looks and plays beutiful. on a decent pc it runs well on most servers. it has some great mods for it consisting of battle royale hamf and alot more. then other missions like wasteland a game where you can shoot muthaas and kill everything you see, then there is altis life, a role play game mode where you do drugs kill coppas and have an allout good time. i would greatly reccomend the game to avid mil sim players.",1
"power of arma is in modding and community, it is improved a lot since previous titles and bis will support its development further. (good side) nice graphics improvement from arma 2, the game has an editor that let you do what you want on a huge map and multiplayer is fun. (bad side) the campaign is ok, fps drop in towns and the game is hard for beginners and bad vechiles physics. conclusion best military simulation i have ever played, and possible one of the best games.",2
"as of late i find this game to be alot more entertaining that the current dayz. although the dayz graphics are better in some ways this just has so much more to do other than run......forever.",1
"as a reddit gold user, ive waded through dirt and mud (referring to dreaded reposts, haha!) before so i know what to expect from a real life army man simulator. this was not what i was expecting. i was put in to a tight spot with my team, i couldnt even move, let alone adjust my fedora to tip at the lady members of our team! (just kidding, there were none! get in the kitchen! haha!) and i even died once while i was distracted, looking at the funnybanana meme which yes, i did save. thanks john! its a great game, but i dont think ill be playing it much when i get accepted in to the r/megalounge! haha! get me a whiskey on the rocks, autobutler! haha! - peter",1
"this is one of the best games i have ever played. one of the most realistic military shooters out there. if you get the right mods for this game, you can make it even more epic. i recommend you get this game when its on sale though. oh and by the way, all of the glitches, and stupid bugs in this game is what makes this game so amazing.",2
"of all hardware intensive games we have, arma 3 has the best muiltiplayer. when we arent lagging around the map, pretending to be wizards, we are experiencing the wonderous 15 fps, which makes it more cinematic, especially when you are using textures that look like they were professionally spray painted in ms.paint. 11/10 would play again!",1
"love this game love playing it. still needs a bit of work like adding new weapons helicopters but other then that its a great game.",4
"love the realism this game brings to the 1st/3rd person action genre. recommend to anyone looking to step up from battlefield or call of duty.",1
"good game if you can find the right people to play with look for a clan",2
"i tricked a 12 year old cop and stole his cop car. 11/10",1
"its realistic in terms of graphics and gameplay. lots of different game modes/mods which give the game a broad spectrum, thus catering for any type of player. dayz players would enjoy it.",1
"yes arma 3 is amazing, its not only fun but its huge.",3
"tried to do a backflip in a helicopter, didnt press z whilst upside down... i died. 99/11",1
"a2 but with all bugs fixed, well most, but im very upset that i bought it at the beginning of the week and wasnt thinking of steam summer sale, and now its $20 less. grrrr. but yeah this arma is way more realistic, way improved, weapon customization, smoother gameplay, and if you are really looking for some tactical realism, this game is home to the most serious gaming clans. but hey its $40!! buy it!",1
"i was wondering if someone could help me , i can run the game fine between in the game all the buttons work but what ever i have the moving setup to be , so its normally w,a,s,d but i push the button and it doesnt move , does any know how to solve this ?",1
"this is a beautifully detailed military simulation, but sadly quite a poor computer game. it demands a very powerful pc to run well, and it is not at all friendly to new players. there also doesnt seem to much hand crafted content besides the huge sandbox they created. for example, i remember playing several fun missions in the original operation flashpoint with my friends, but when i tried to play co-op with a friend in this new game, there was very little to choose from and some missions were very confusing.",1
"gives me hours of enjoyment. worth the $60. and i highly recomend.",1
"amazing experience, especially when playing multiplayer. cooperative online is where this game really shines. though just in like real life warfare, you sometimes spend more time on logistics than on actual fighting. the beauty of this game makes this all more than worth it, while the game also fixes most of the major frustrations from arma2, including a handy new inventory system and much smoother infantry control.",3
"install mods incinerate bosnia remove kebab praise vojislav eelj get put on the nsa watchlist. best game of my life",1
"so complicated cant understand but is fun if you want this game i would recommend insurgency because it is simpler unless you love arma series",1
"picture yourself standing in the middle of ing nowhere then having to run 60 miles to get home, you picturing that? well the game should really be called arma 3 the real jogging simulator or dream smasher because let me tell ya you run for that long and get some cool gear, youre probably gonna get killed",2
"absolutely the best game i own. worth all 60$ of it. already have 100+ hours and have barely even dug into altis life alone. there is so much you can do in this game, and its all beautiful, because the graphics in this game are amazing. 11/10 would recommend to anyone.",2
"pros: great comunity cons: really really really poorly optimised. go buy arma 2 its only really poorly optimised. wait for a steam sale.",1
"earlier today i was in a game where this guy jack would just repeatedly teamkill everyone. the person in charge of the game smote him with a ing crazy lightning bolt, and spawn butterflys on his corpse. then we had an atv race down a ravine, and the gm called a missile strike on the finish line. 10/10 would play again.",1
"pilot jumpsuit army vs. iranians from outer space. and some greek guys that suck.",2
"if you want a good game to roleplay in get this game, it has the altis life mode which is like gta online on steriods but with real roleplay and jobs. 10/10.",1
"loved this game from day one, now 6 months later i still love it",1
"very good and impressive, especially for me, im a not easily pleased when it comes to video games i would reccomend this to all my friends it made a big jump from arma ii",1
"what can i say about this game , good points is that its very modable and enjoyable with or with out mods , but this game comes to light when it has mods installed . bad point about the game is the stamina bar as seems the devs had so unfit poor soul run his  off as seems if you run more then 50 m you cant hit thing beacuse of your scope bouncing around all over the place when you stop . but overall it great game to play and the task force radio mod is must adds more depth and realism",1
"spawned killed many civs were the gun shop was then i saw one getting held up so decided to be nice so i shot the bad guy took his stuff nice gun btw then blew the civs head off with my favorite gun the m1911 *bam* he fell to the ground dead will do this again but i was kicked off the server 10/10",1
"absolutltely no , big no, do not buy this game. this game is super worked, is for geeks that like details to te point that is no fun. to many keys, to hard to figure stuff and when you figure it you need to many keys to make it happen. i buy it, if i could have the chance again to not bui it i would not buy this game. grafics = awsome, hard worked, like i said a game for perfectionists, but a common folk will have no fun. not recomended",1
"great addition to the arma series, it is buggy sometimes, weird along funny bugs.",1
"to be honest arma 3 alone is good but the community mods for it are really what makes the game come alive in the mil sim community! once you go arma you will never go back.",4
"if you like realistic war game, then arma 3 is what your are looking for. :)",1
"recommended for people who enjoy cod. but feel trapped in tiny maps with no ability to drive/fly vehicles at will. arma has all of those and more",2
"got arrested for standing still for too long. and got kidnapped 6 times in one hour.",1
"fantastic game. a really immersive game that you can pump a lot of hours into. plus an incredibly complex and expansive multiplayer.",1
"this game is beautiful every aspect of the game is something to love the mods are the best part and the community is great for the most part too. highly recommend although, dont buy it for the full $60 u can find this game in many places for much cheaper",2
"arma 3: arma the almighty miletary sim, which may catch your eye with the immersive feel and the futuristic feel which i will get to later. i feel that this is a good arma but not on the same par as arma 2 which can i tell you can be either a bag of piss or alot of fun to play with bugs and  ai to some of the most action packed immersive combat you will experience to date. arma 3 delivers what it sets out to do an invasion of a made up map and you need to help secure it (sorry if you would class that as a spoiler). there are few if any bugs and beautifull graphics great multiplayer improvement from arma 2 but as a fan of the series i am a bit dissapointed in bohemia with their choice of a futeristic feel which i dont personally like compared to modern combat. if you are a laid back gamer you will still enjoy this title due to the community, multiplayer, beauty, editor. the editor is my favourite part of the game as it lets you be creative and put what you would want in a campaign mission into your own. overall i would reccomend this game but if you are looking for an army sim go for arma 2 by far.",1
"arma 3 is really fun and there`s lots of different ame modes to play. there`s really super tactical military simulation servers, then there`s things like altis life where you have your own life on the island. the free updates are really good and the dlc is really worth it for what you get. it`s a bit hard to get used to but it does get easier if you practice. 9/10, really good game but a bit confusing for beginners.",1
"squad-leaders brains got splattered all over me before i could finish taking off my pants. 9/10",1
"you think im a ?! for watching anime? ha what a joke let me tell you a story so you can futher grasp just who it is youre talking to when it comes to earning the right to call someone a . me and my best bro used to play this game where we suck each others  and call the person who cums first a . i usually win because my bros never been all that great at ucking, and when he es in my mouth, i make him finish me off then give him a passionate kiss so he has to swallow both loads. then i berate him for the next hour or so about what a total  he is. to this day ive acumulated over 1200 victories in this battle of skill and edurance, not only over my best bro, but over hundreds of other chalengers. each just wishing to earn the right to even call me a . so next time you decide to try to berate me by claiming im a  for watching anime just remember i doubt you could suck off a  even half as well as i can.",2
"one the best games ever, years of selfmaking content :)",1
"best walking simulator - ign 21/10 (whats nine plus ten)",1
"seems like a good game i wouldnt know so glitchy it crashes me every 10 mins before i get a weapon!",1
"a nice game, but not optimised for amd-multicore users. im a big arma fan, but its unplayable on my pc. (5-20 fps) amd fx-8120 black edition gtx780 8 gb ram probably the game uses one core most of the time. there are a lot of such called tweaks but they all have the placebo effect. please bohemia, fix it. when you have an decent intel processor, this game runs better. still thumbs up for the game.",1
"banned for someone elses fault period life in altis gets givin million bux bi bans me  you bohema!  you!",1
"the game is fine the only problem for it is that its server dependent meaning,.. you need to find a good server in order to have a good game... it lacks offical game servers.",1
"good sim where all mistakes are punished by death.",4
"graphics are very good and the open world is amazing. make sure you have a godly computer if you want to run 60 fps though!",1
"arma iii, the fourth game in the arma series, if we include the original operation flashpoint as well. many mainstream fps gamers complain about armas style, because its unique? thats exactly why i love this game. you really have to find patience and a learning curve to this game. but once you have control over the game, youll find tons of enjoyable content. youll find yourself playing around with the editor, campaign with great storyline, 2 beautiful islands to explore, customizable gear, multiplayer fun as well as serious gameplay. what else do you want? yeah it might have some bugs and lag. but, if you look back at arma 2, not many complained about it though arma 3 is highly improved from the previous title. arma is a huge game that you will be playing for years to come. youll always find ways to emerge into armas gameplay. its ultimately up to you to be creative. because of bohemia interactives hard work on unique warfare gameplay, and immersive experience, id give it 9/10 :)",4
"virtual reality engine is just awesome :) tons of content to play!!",2
"nice game , nice graphics , i recommend for all people to play this game :)",1
"heck say. dispite many bugs and some annoying things this game is just want i like. a tactical shooter without all the run and gun. single player missions are trash but mp and steam workshop makes up for it. the fans really make this game worth it.",1
"this game is a nice roleplay game fun to play with friends too so it worth to buy this game!!",1
"lots of fun game modes, altis life, wasteland, battle royale etc. hackers can be a bit of a bit of a problem crashing servers every so often and killing everyone. graphics are nice. movements and gunplay can occasionally be clunky. lots of different stances for any type of situation and lots of vehicles to have fun with. overall 8.5/10.",1
"arma 3 is definatly easily my favorite game of all time, it produced an unforgetable experience, it showed stunning visual gamplay along with a brilliant engine that works very well with the game, it has a massive selection of weapons and vehicles. the community of arma 3 is amazingly massive, there are tons of gamemodes and servers just waiting to be played on. it comes with a campaign that is entertaining and well developed. it also has a gigantic workshop community with new weapon skins, vehicles and all sorts being added each day. this game is simply fantastic and well worth every penny. 10/10",2
"if i could give this game 5 stars... i wouldnt... but 4.5 without question, this game is a tonne of fun if your looking for something way more realistic than battlefeild! best served with a squad and a large helping of patience... also expect many random deaths due to walls and stuff",2
"this is the most amzing strategy fps war simulation game ever , and i have been playing who knows tones of those type , but here the amazing team bohemia interactive just show again a huge quality and talent behind arma 3 and its dlc ! if you like editing this is even better you will never be bored, the game is endless and offers you a way to create your own campagn or mission or just simply what you want to be challenged of on a warfield ^^ arma 3 is so far to me the best war game simulation :) looking forward to play again ! stop reading now and go get it ...",1
"bought this game for the mods only! worth it 100%. br + breaking point = hours of fun.",1
"one of the few games i have not regretted purchasing. i highly recommend this game if you are patient and willing to learn the mechanics. this is as thorough and realistic as you are going to get in a military game. not just a fps, a true military game.",1
"if theres ever been a game for everyone its arma 3. the graphics are spactacular and the engine never stops amazing me. there are many multiplayer modes that inculde everyone from king of the hill to altis life the glories are endless! 10/10",1
"how about fixing this game first then make updates and dlc,s?????? i mean i got 1 of the top class pc and i am unable to play at 60 fps in mp with mroe then 5 players i mean wtf???",1
"the arma sierecs for me was a hard franshies to get into, but if you know what you are doing and can undersatand the advance controls, you can have a bunch of fun. for example my freind and i realy enjoy playing wastland (what dayz was based off of) doing missions and getting geo cheashes. so over all if you have friends that like to play with game or like to have a massive world to mess around in, get it, and if you have tried dayz or want to, play wastland it is a verry good gamemode with more wepons and vehicles. p.s. if you do play wastland find food and water, it is in buildings ;)",2
"arma 3, iv spent many an hour on you and i still dont know how you work... be careful, wooden fences may blow up your tank xd awesome game",1
"a very good simulation and game. so many things to! good buy if u like these sort of games!",2
"an unbelievable step forward in nearly every respect within an already great series. graphically sublime with most improvements focusing on animation and gameplay fluidity. steam workshop has made the world of modding and mission making bigger and more accessible than ever before. a triumph.",2
"best of its kind! still a bit buggy but great fun and everything is possible! :d",2
"even at 10fps still fun, now thats saying something",1
"this game is endless fun but has a steep learning curve.",2
"a very good game, extraudinary graphics, the best game if your looking for a game with a large community and a lot of variation, many different gamemodes such as epoch which has an amazing community and many servers, or maybe battle royal which is the perfect game for adrenaline when your running throught the forest hoping not to get killed, but anyway, now we come onto the bad parts: its rather expensive for what you get, they charge you for the actuall game but when your in a server and then u feel the relief of finding some kind of rare vehicle such as a helicopter, you find out you cant enter the vehicle because you need to spend more money on all the dlcs, when i found this out i just thought the game lost its touch. but its still an amazing game with great graphics, i also found that if you play it on your own or you like to play games solo you dont live the game up to the full potential, when i first logged in i instantly knew this was a game for co-operative play with friends where stratagy is the key but in the end, this is just my opinion of the game, i hope this has helped everyone who is thinking about buying this game and if you do, happy huntin boys :d",1
"as always, this still is the best military simulator in the world! arma keeps affascinating me for its realism. i really suggest you to buy the game if youre a fan of war, real war. the maps are really detailed and the ai is really ! actually, too much but there are mods that can help you resolve that problem. anyway, if you buy this game, play it with a clan. arma 3 really makes you cooperate with other people in order to survive and complete your mission. if youre a cod fan, you rather change side or forget about arma. they are completely different, and arma itself is usually not liked by shoot and run fan boys. however, armas editor allows you to create your own missions in every detail. actually, its not too simple making them, but with some commands and other stuff you can start making some nice missions and enjoy the game with your friends. furthermore, there are tons of forums and people that can help you improve your editing skills providing you with commands, suggestions, and scripts. enjoy.",1
"having owned this since the alpha, i can say i highly recommend it. this beautiful game brings not only fantastic single and multiplayer modes, but stunning graphics as well. it has a much better optimization than arma 2, but is also more graphically intensive due to being a newer game. modding community is very developed and mods are plentiful. breaking point mod highly recomended for those who enjoy dayz. all together an amazing game and a huge step-up from arma 2.",2
"very unsatisfied with this purchase. im still playng arma 2 at this point very little time is wasted with arma 3. i am running a computer than can compleatly blast arma 2 i7 proccessor nividia graphics card (not the best but still expensive and good) and loads of memory and internet capability and this game runs total crap in multiplayer and 30fps on single with all graphics turned to bare minimum it looks only slightly better than arma 2 at this point. i could get past all that but the way you pick up ammo is just stupid really stupid. further more the ai is call of duty dumb and the part that ruins the game completly......you have to shhot enemys up to 5 times to drop them, now its based in the future so i figured maybe they are basing the logic on some form of new armor ok, so i aim for the arms and the thick part of the leg, a very easy kill or incapacitate shot for a 7.62, nope nothin just needs the same shots in. its like they forgot everything that arma was about. its like call of duty sandbox style",1
"great all around combat sim. if youve played arma since the beginning then im sure your loving this one too. if you havent played arma then, well, what the hell are you waiting for!",4
"totally awsoome game with nice graphics does not regret a single coin spent on this game.",2
"when i got arma 3 i was a little worried that this game would not be for me. but after putting over 200 hours into the game, i can safely say this game is an amazing video game and highly recommened it to any call of duty players as my self looking for a new way of looking at war games. arma 3 provides so much along the line of the base story, super fun multiplayer games, and also an awesome editor system. some things i suggest doing if you buy this game is finding a group of people to play with. because although this game is great by its self, it is much more fun with freinds. i have met alot of great people on this game that i play with constanly. another thing i suggest you do in arma 3 is try out the editor. you can make some really cool stuff with it. i have made around 6 missions that i can play with my freinds whenever i want to. now i am not going to lie there are some bad things about this game as well. for one multiplayer can get a little stupid sometimes along the lines of, well other players. there is also the glitches that pop up now and again. and if you really want to have fun in this game you better have some good internet connection and a decent computer. but all in all this game is pretty darn good and i highly recommend this game to war game gamers.",2
"amazing game. probably my most favourite. worth every penny.",2
"not much servers without large mods no more but you know 9.8/10",1
"much like its predecessor, arma 3 is an outstandingly good game. the sandbox action and incredible battles that the player can create are absolutely brilliant, and its great graphics also provide a treat for the eyes. that being said, i cant recommend it entirely. the amount of realism is a bit too much, and i guess thats the dilemma with shooters. theres one series that makes about as much sense as the plot of batman & robin, a totally unrealistic game; but with this, its like, you walk 10 feet and then you have the aim of an imperial stormtrooper. also, the amount of keys it has is a bit too much to bear at some times, and configuring them can be an absolute nightmare. my ultimate verdict is that i recommend arma 3, but there are still some things that i dont really like about it. im not attempting to ward off potential buyers, but just know that every rose has its thorns.",2
"okay let me start ... arma 3 is a amazing game massivly improving from arma 2/oa. if there is something you dislike about the game there is more than likly a mod to fix that .... lack of dinosaurs for example ... there is a mod for that. the only problem i have is that the dlc in this game is cool but i dont think it is worth the money. to be honest you could just get mods that do the exact same thing as the paid dlc so i do not see the point in it",2
"severely underated game. even with its growing popularity, its still overlooked by many many people. trying to get my friends to play it is a chore, probably because theyre too pansy to make any effort to get through the learning curve.",1
"i played the game at free weekend and i find it very good but even more promising. the graphics are breathtaking while the gameplay, in my opinion, can imrove a bit. i loved the greek setting, it reminds me of my vacations. the bad thing is that the free weekend is over and now i cant afford to buy the full game...anyone offering it as a gift? :)",1
"i wouldve gotten more enjoyment out of burning the 25 than by buying this buggy, laggy, always-35-fps-max-no-matter-if-settings-are-on-low-or-on-ultra, looking like crap piece of .",1
"great game, hate that the dlc comes up in my game, i would buy for the right price, purchased carts, maybe if helicopers was priced around $5.00 that would be exceptable, since at this time i dont have it, i would like to see the dlc ads in my game gone, mods and dlc are great dont get me wrong, just no need for it in game.",2
"dont buy since the last patch theres been thousands complaining there game crashes",3
"love the game so mush more than call of duty and has better graphics but the map is a tad too big,",2
"i highly recommend this game for any wanting to see the closest thing to real life combat without actually joining the army. not only does this simulate real military tactics but provides an excellent window of opportunity for clans to really feel like they are in the middle of a war! friends can get together and act like the special forces team that they all wanted when they were little kids! you can even have roleplaying games and custom games such as cops and robbers! this is by far my favorite military game of all time! sure it takes a while to learn about the dangers of not going prone when an enemy comes by or getting major fatigue in the middle of a firefight but it is a simulator and by far the best one for military standards. i do not recommend this game for the call of duty & battlefield lovers because there is just no simple respawn or run and gun it situation this is not built for deathmatches! it is built to be a simulator that simulates real time combat for the hardcore people! there are no killstreaks/cod type loadouts/simple respawn or scoreboard. if anyone gets mad because this game is just a simulator i only have one thing to say. this game is not for you!",1
"excellent military simulator with a wide variety of difficulty options, and editing stuff to customize your own military scenarios. supports steam workshop, achivements, trading cards, all round a much better steam focused game than arma 2. still, arma 2 is arguably better, but arma iii is still a great game. caution: the game may be very dificcult, even for the experience fps players. this game is a military simulator, it isnt cod or battlefield. so keep in mind that even on lowest difficulty, you may find this game very challenging.",1
"true battle simulator 2014 when you want it to be, but also a hint of rpg. obviously by a hint i mean the ~1000 altis life servers running right now. love this game, its my most played game. king of the hill, battle-royale, wasteland, breaking point, and countless life type servers make this a great game for programmers and players. worth the $60 i didnt spend for it. *cough* bought it *cough* reatil. *cough*",2
"online multiplayer: me: under fire friend: where from!? me:i dont know....ummm (checking compass bearing)....oh doesnt matter im dead friend: oh ok awesome game with huge diversity, play as a team for best experience, only probelm with this game is that the online servers can sometimes have really terrible fps with your pc, even if you have a good rig.",1
"arma 3 is a very fun game. on my other account i have put about 2000 hrs into arma 2. i just love the francise! very good driving mechanics also!",2
"best game so far, many great mods, fantastic community, awesome atmosphere 10/10 would recomend",1
"if you are looking for a more realistic experience from a first-person/third-person shooter, then this game is most definitely for you.",4
"get this game it is amazing. ive played 6 hours straight in one day. yes, thats how good it is.",1
"this is by far the best military game ive ever played; if you have money to spend and a good rig; buy this game",1
"arma iii in my opinion is a vast improvement over arma ii. theyve changed everything; making gun play much more well rounded, to smoothing out the driving mechanics. i enjoy the new equipment system, now instead of the old clunky backpack, you get a screen showing your character and two inventory slots (if youre looting a corpse, or picking something up) also if you remember the terrible main story of arma ii and operation arrowhead, then youll be satisfied to know that they did a complete 180 and actually tried with arma iii. i will say that i have some mixed feelings on how simplified arma iii feels compared to its predecessor, i do enjoy its easy to learn system, though i also feel a little put off by it as well. armas a game i play because of its somewhat complicated mechanics; if i wanted to play something simplified id go for battlefield or some other boring first person shooter. nevertheless this is a very well made game, and i urge you all to go and check it out.",1
"arma 3 is the most realistic military sim ive seen. you can find no other game that goes in such detail with weapons than arma 3. though there is a huge lack of weapons and the maps are dull, empty, and boring, it is a good all-around game. what you cant find in the game you can find in mods although it can be inconvient since the since the arma 3 steam workshop only can allow 1 pbo and only 200 mbs of space. anyway its a great simulator that needs few improvements and steam compatibility but a great game.",4
"led a small detatchment from the stratis island, trying to escape the exploding red people. we crashed on altis, trying to avoid the close air support jets in the air aswell as, you guessed it, more exploding red people. we escaped from the island with boats. 10/10 would die from exploding red people again",3
"unless there is no onther gome like this so you guys gonna get it. but i dont get why the programmers are not so interested in making a game which is playable..",3

"good game. 9/10 soo many things to do like altis life or battle royale",1
"you can  foot around with 13 year olds that want to do your mom when playing cod or battlefield games. when you want to step up to a mans fps, strap yourself in to arma 2 or 3, and join an arma community. be treated like a man.",1
"great combat simulator. the latest update made the sound effects 20x better and has made the game far more immersive than before. there are a tonne of different modes to enjoy and you can play any role you want ranging from a field medic, to a support pilot flying jets.",2
"if you like a single-player story-driven game where you are lead by commanders who are insane beyond belief, then this is the game for you. missions normally play like this... commander: kerry, we need you to take over location x. heres an rpg, 2 rockets, a rifle, 6 magazines, 2 grenades, some 40mm rounds, and 5 first aid kits. here is a squad of 5 people. five minutes into the mission, i am wounded and my entire squad is dead leaving me to face against 30 people alone and 1-2 armored vehicles. after about an hour of dying, i will have completed the mission. i feel like almost a god... 5/5 would recommend to military lovers and/or people who love to die.",1
"arma one of the greatest combat simulators of all time, armed assault may run  on my pc but i wont lie its still fun as hell.",1
"184.2 hrs on record, and i still have problems with cas 10/10, would buy again.",2
"fun game its best played with friends though however it does feel very realistic and it takes a bit to get used to if ur used to more close ranged fps",2
"really really fun game but it takes a certain type of gamer cause there are some bugs. but it has so much stuff you can do such as modding, rpg, wasteland, and missions",2
"this is a very involved game but a lot of fun very real gameplay and awesome physics",1
"excellent military-sim sandbox with a nearly endless plethora of mods. remember playing plastic army men as kids? this is way better ;)",2
"got this game on a friends recommendation. i tried the life servers. it sucks. the interface blows. plus, i dont feel like mining apples or whatever because i dont feel i should have to buy some kind of license to make dope.",1
"if you have a high end gaming pc and you are interested in heavy military simulators definitly get this game. its the few of its kind with that much detail and that level of simulation. its a really fun game.",1
"flew a plane into a person and he got stuck on my wing hanging over the rockets, shot a rocket, plane explodes. 11/10",1
"great for realism and simulation enthusiasts. but if your just buying this for wastelands or because you liked dayz, you can promptly  off and not get this game.",4
"will not update it goes to 100 then update pasued then ill play it and makes me redo the update then over and over again someone help plz",2
"dont believe the neckbeards saying its a military simulator. its immersive to an extent, but a mid level cod player could drop in with no problem. you see guys you shoot guys. the difference being there 500 meters away in tanks with thermal vision.",1
"beautiful game. only downside is that actually shooting people isnt really all that enjoyable. people have a mini-seizure everytime they get shot then ragdoll.",1
"nonfunctional game , 6fps multiplayer , no ai , no campaign.",1
"if you like military shooters and realism, this is your game. only complaint is the mp as its not overly optimized at the moment.",1

"arma 3. well what can i say about this piece of . for a normally 60 dollar game the graphic are unappealing to say the least. alright, thats it! im done with this game! id rather press my face against a hippopotamus butt while it muck-spreads! thats when a hippo takes a , rather than allowing the  to drop from its , it presses its tail against its own -crack, waving it back and forth, shredding the  all over the place! thats how much fun this game is! like putting a turd in a fan or a band-saw, you just dont do it! in other words dont buy it save ur money.",1
"been a huge fan of the series, waited a while for them to iron out most of the problems, and i must say i am not disapointed at all",1
"fantastic game 9/10. visuals are amazing on any setting above medium. style of gameplay is completely up to you. replayability is infinite. audio is brilliant. the only downfall is the ai (if you have no mods on), the settings for their skill levels needs a bit of refining. its either theyre as dumb as a stump or so smart that they drop you before you can even get ready. definitely recommend.",3

"great game! wether yout looking to play a tactical fps or an rpg or just a co-op with your friends arma 3 is right for you!",1
"its optimization was done by an autistc four year old, and its pretty much only fun with friends. would recommend.",1
"a fantastic game which hold countless hours of gameplay and stories and funtimes :dddd",1

"my friend blew up a friendly helicopter after we told him it was friendly. he said he panicked, there was one survivor*, 10/10 would play again i love this game xd seriously fun game though. *out of 7",2
"quite possibly the best fps experience out there, multiplayer wise, story i wasnt to fond of. for me there isnt a game that comes close to the real deal  as this one does. very very fun. cod and even battlefield players be warned this game isnt a run and gun in multiplayer, it requires teamwork so long as your teammates are not shooting you in the head just to steal your startup cash, it is a very communication teamwork based. yes you can go it alone but your chances of being surviving and objective or mission in multiplayer dwindle without someone making sure your not gonna get sniped as you go in assuming you dont get killed by the npcs at that objective. i like how you have to set your range on most medium to long ranged rifle scopes and damn near all vehicle guns/cannons etc. im telling you now i cant explain this game all in one review just buy it theres nothing more to say other than your crazy if you dont. it is a bit demanding for hardware but if you have nvidia card 660ti or above and have the geforce experince and let it optimize the game for you i find that i can get 45-55 fps. correct me if im wrong others in the community but im pretty sure this game will support 4k.",5

"arma 3 is a great tactical shooter. im going through cons first and then pros. cons -sometimes joining servers might be laggy -if you dont have a good pc you wont be able to run this game -single player isnt the best thing in this game pros +great multiplayer +good graphics +many weapons and vehicles +really good tactical shooter 8/10 when playing alone. 9/10 with friends",1
"this game is just so mutch u can do in :d its epic for my, base building, rp, fps, it got everything",2
"its arma, not call of duty or battlefield or halo or whatever... its simulation, so no 360quickscope, no gender-related bashing, no noobs vs pro to a certain degree, simply one of the best simulations game in existence. its basically a military simulations, with multiplayers and good gameplay, with multitudes of community mods. with massive content created by community, you buy this game, you could play more than just 1 game. yeah, wanna play the sims? arma 3 have it. wanna play tank battle? arma 3 have it. wanna play ace combat? arma 3 have it. wanna play racing games? arma 3 have it. wanna play... oh come on, try them for yourself! im not paid to write long review, so im gonna leave it here. oh, and zombies... hehe, whats better than playing zombie in arma themed world? download a zombie mod, use a script to spawn tank, and have fun!",2
"arma 2? amazing. decent dlc. arma 3? great. horrible dlc. for the simple fact theyre charging 10.99 for two helicopters, im just done witht his game.",1
"arma iii: is a outstanding fps simulation, that has great graphics; fluent and realistic gameplay. although it is 39.99 it is worth the money. the open world is amazing it includes;a underwater world enviroment; cool new vehiciles like the hunter, bodacious air play with planes, ospreys and helicopters. finally immersive infantry gameplay with awsome weapons. thats why you should definatley get if, also i want someone to play arma iii: with me.",2
"if you like military simulation this game is definitely for you. although its just an alpha its already much better than any other arma title was on launch day.",2
"what mods i think should be in the game: acre, for radio comms. allinarma terrain pack  this brings over the arma 2 & arma 1 terrains. shacktac mods, including sthud, stgi, stnt, stacre volume, st bunnyhop, st interact, st map autobrightness, st idle anim fix, st contour enable rh m4s and hlc weapon packs killochs multi-national force uniforms mbg killhouses, mrb voice stop, taosenais paper map, vts weapon rest. what they do: this should be in the game, cold war weapons, some buildings, shacktac mods, all armas terrains/maps, acre for a good voip, and a alot of national forces (with uniforms and gear) mrb voice stop, stops/reduces the radio chat from ai; paper map its a handed map and vts weapon rest for weaponing resting. thanks for reading =)",2

"arma 3 is one of the best open world games i have ever played. it has a wide variety of gamemodes and mods for everyone. unlike arma 2 its graphics have hade a massive step up and the first person is a whole lot smoother not like arma 2 choppy first person.",4
"best military sim out there. pub games will almost always have team killers, trolls, and little kids that scream their lungs off in side chat. but find a decent whitelist server, and youll have an incredible experience. i highly recommend downloading the acre (advanced combat radio environment) mod and once it comes out the ace (advanced combat environment) mod to add to the realism. if youre looking for a game where you can hop on the computer and play for a few minutes, this is not it; but if you want a full scale, realistic battle, then welcome to arma 3 my friend.",1

"brilliant game mechanics, challenging gameplay; a must-have if you are an ex-cadet or militarily minded...",2
"arma 3 improves on its prececessor in nearly every imaginable way. true to arma form, there are bugs and glitches and some graphical elements are a bit wonky, but the gameplay is substantially improved, the graphics for such a large scale are excellent, and the community is great. with dayz going standalone, and arma 2 maps imported into arma 3, i cant think of any reason at all to go back to arma 2. a great improvement in the series and the crown jewel of military simulation.",1
"walk-simulator...but if you have a couple of friends for coop it is fun i loved the old operation flashpoints games. you could save when you want, now with arma iii you cant, that makes replaying missions so annyoing, walking everytime like 5 minutes, again and again... also the peformence is terrible, you have to make the game very ugly to play it fluent on modern systems. please go back to your roots developer! about the multiplayer i cant say much, people banning you for no reason, but i like the coop if you find nice peoeple. on the good side, the controls improved very much, but i dont get the point of people saying it is a simulation if you cant even release your bipod...even in the arcade game battlefield 3/4 you can release your bipod... also the enemies can see through plants/threes and on. on sale you can have fun with it, but i would not buy this for a full price.",1

"sadly i have to not recomend this one, so i got this game expecting hours of fun screwing around on servers, which didnt disapoint, however, that being said, it lacked in many areas. for one, the graphics had much to be desired, and animations clipped horrificly, no to mention the complexity of the controls. its not a bad game, but the graphics and such need to catch up to the content",1
"you have to get this game. addicting. thats all. bye.",3
"after so many hours of playing this game, i can now truly say that this game is worth it. there are many many reasons into why this game is worth it, my first reason would be the workshop scenerios and edit missions, you can make your own missions to your hearts desire, the game is quite easy to edit on maps and now with the world maker, we are soon to find new maps in the coming years, second reason is the multiplayer... yes right now its still young and so was arma ii was young multiplayer was awful but in a year or two there will be more networking optimization in which online gaming will be the main core of arma iii. thats all i want to say, i can go into so much more details on realism and how i always come back to this game when i dont want to play fast shooting games. arma iii while still new and adding more and more stuff which includes the workshop will become one of the best games by bi and i am glad to say that this is a full on recommended game. please support bi, 60 dollars is nothing for this game especially when workshop is free, p.s : you buy bf4 for 60 and add the crazy dlc and no mod support at all when you pay 60 for arma 3 and you get full mod support and some dlc of your choice, but because of mod support with workshop arma 3 is the best choice when spending 40-60$",3
"arma 3 - the game operation flashpoint tried to be on the consoles... this however, is a whole sifferent story. it is tough to start with but persevere and what you are presented with is a hard working, rewarding experience that only pc gaming can provide. if and when you finish the content the game is packaged with, you can then turn to the steam workshop and pick up hand crafted missions to keep you going for probably forever. to be honest this makes it look like cod and battlefield are aimed at the pre 15 year old market... ready to play something sensible and realistic? buy and play arma 3.",1
"ive played many hours on this game... and the singleplayer sucks... the only thing that kept my hopes alive was the multiplayer. and my hope. is still in this franchise",2

"if youre looking for a good time go into a game, of people trying to talk like real life military radio operators. its hilarious. 11/10",1
"im not going to say, buy this game!! because its not for everyone, if you like arma 2 or military, fps shooters (not cod, thats more like an arcade game) then yeah this game is awesome and is a leader in that market. if you think this game is full on, arcade style action packs bullets,bombs and metal flying all over the place, its not, but its just as fun as one of those games.",4
"i have been playing arma 3 for the past couple days (with the free trial), and i was really concidering buying this game. however, even with all the realistic featues that i love, i cannot stand the fatigue and weapon sway system. after running for 3-4 minutes, a short sprint, or getting nicked by a bullet, it becomes nearly impossible to aim. even while focusing and holing my breath, the weapon is still moving to dramatically to accuratly hit a target at even a hundred meters with a scope. the army is trained to be able to shoot under stress, fatigue, and even injury. i myself have done 100 meter sprints, and half mile runs, then grabbed my ar immediatly after and can still quickly and accurately hit a man sized target at 100 meters. also, i only shoot with iron sights. until this unrealistic fatigue and weapon sway system is fixed, i will not be buying the game. honestly, what is the point of buying it if i cant even engage the ai, (who, guess what, can still accurately shoot you while injured or fatigued!)",1
"spend 40 minutes just to form a group with some guys to attack the enemy base and then my computer turned off. 11/10 would play again to do the mission again :d",1

"this game is the most fun and realistic military sim i have ever played. much better than battlefield or call of duty claim to be. maps are huge and combat is large and extensive. i would highly recommend this game.",1
"i like this game dont get me wrong but the optimal requirments to play it are ridiciuosly high and most pcs can thandle it therefor if your pc isnt beastly dont buy this game.",1
"love this game , great community and people have the best of servers. the a3l stolen stuff drama is fun to watch ;) love a bit of drama , great altis life servers out there and also some amazing mods to play with. i am aiming to finish the campaign soon since im finding it semi difficult but i will get there ;p 10/10 would bang again play*",3

"awesome game! wasnt too sure about it during the beta, but upon full release, this game is really awesome. there are lots of great planned (free) features coming out soon as well, which is great, as things will never get dull. the devs are activly updating and adding new content. if you are a fan of arma 2, you will love arma 3",1

"love it, or hate me. great sandbox, a living community, wonderful graphics, a lot of missions trough steam-workshop, and the zeus add-on (for free) combines ego-shooter with real-time strategy.",4
"this is great game very fun to play i mostly play altis life which is prety cool how everything works the storyline for single player is fine all together a great game",1
"bohemia have really stepped up their game. i got this while it was still in alpha. felt like arma 2.5 at that point. come now to the release of survive i cant wait for more. imagine that, the story of a bloody arma game has me engaged as . i am only talking about survive, not multiplayer. this is so much better paced than arma 2 was. graphics (minus far terrain) are brilliant. also of all things, pacing is amazing. when choppers start flying over, it has impact. when a mortar hits nearby, it actually has impact because they are not being spammed. there is an idea of scarcity, and it makes you feel like such an underdog. and that is ing brilliant. the feel of control of your guns fells so much better. the sights are also very nice. many improvements over arma 2. overall so far, this is a massive improvement over arma 2, keep this up bohemia, i am really starting to like you guys",1
"for the 3 hours i played it, i liked it a lot and wish i could afford it. 8/10 for being to exspensive",1
"paid 40 bucks on day 1 of the summer sale, nows its 30. woot.",1
"great game, i like the king of the hill mode, they seem to be improving it really well. just a lot of buttons, and the steam workshop is a nice touch. only downside is this games horriable engine. the engine its self is from 2001 and its been pushed beyond what it can really handle on the clients side. once you start to add about 20 ai or players the engine starts to use the cpu or video card less and less cuasing a performance drop. i seen maybe 30% cpu/gpu usage on a 106 player king of the hill match with 30 - 35fps hile on armory i can pull well into the 80s with a few players. thats my only gripe about this game. if they would fix that then i would have no complaints at all.",2
"great game, best military sim. good single player great multi-player either huge vs or even small squads vs ai or players. steamworkshop plus the lvl editor gives you a unlimited supply of missions, self made or other players.",1
"awesome game, its a shame that there is no day-z mod..",1
"ok so this review is quite short and you probably think its really stupid but anyways. this game is amazing from the user created mods to the interesting missions and level editor. i got this game about a year ago and instantly got hooked to the king of the hill mod my first day of playing it i got to about rank 12 and i loved every second. the next day i started playing some more but when i logged on i was banned why? no idea ws admin ban (random numbers i dont care about) i thought it was just that server so i tried joining another banned tried another banned until i realized i was banned from all servers. this especially sucked because i had just baught the game and i was not hacking i have played flashpoint arma cold war arma 2 arma 2 oa and never cheated/hacked in those games. due to this incident i can not recommend this game as i wasted my money and only bothered to do this review now because i watched a rhinocrunch video sniping 101 which was awesome and i hungered for arma but i never satisfied it.",1
"this is very addicting and there is alot u can do from creating your own game to playing in an altis life server. i think about this game day and night and cant sleep ever since i got it. i dream about it in my sleep and sometimes i get wet no lie. buy this game and together we can make babies.",1
"arma 3 is the culmination of 13yrs of open world, military sim expertise from bohemia interactive. if youre looking for a challenging yet rewarding combat experience, look no further. youre not going to be able to run 10mph, or destroy cars with your fists, or have to pump a full magazine into a bad guy to drop them. like the classic game bushido blade, a single strike can kill the enemy. one round to an unprotected head and they drop. a huge improvement over its predecessor, arma 3 improves in all aspects of the game. the vehicle physics, animation systems, ballistics and first person camera have all been updated significantly or rebuilt from scratch. this is a sim worth your time.",2
"this game is amazing, and the mods make it so much better. if you are a fan of simulators (not like cod), please get this game now!",2

"very fun if you like rpg and hunger games. ( atlis life rpg, battle royale hungergames)",1
"easily the most intense and realistic first person shooter ive ever played. the multiplayer is tactical, intense, and gives you reason to play smart and avoid death. not for the average call of duty or battlefield player! this game requires much more patience and is for a more serious/tactical gaming mind. its worth the money!",1

"i was introduced to arma through the dayz mod for arma 2. it says a lot when a game is so moddable that it spawns other games... ive bought arma 3 during the alpha. best money ive ever spent. find a good clan/group/community and youll have a hard time running out of things to do with this game. cherry on top? the devs are mad men. they hammer daily on the dev branch and release monster patch notes every months. the game has a few flaws like the scroll menu that makes me sometimes lose my  when i try to open a door and instead change weapon. ladders. oh dear god ladders. if you want a good fps with awesome vehicles. arma 3 is for you. and when you think youre done... go look at the mods...",2
"the greatest military sandbox i have ever played, arma 3 is a lovingly crafted game, giving you an endless amount of scenerios to enjoy. singleplayer gives you the option to screw around with the editor and either create the insane or the epic. its a challenge to learn but well worth it. the main campaign can be frustrating at times, but overall is a very excellent experience. user-made content and scenerios add another layer of depth, and zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer. multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game, giving an in-depth experience in many a situation. you can play it as a roleplayer, joining life servers. you can be a survivor of the wastes in wasteland, or you can join in many user-made situations. the greatest of the options, however, is proper, team-based objective gameplay. with the right men, squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds. it gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team, and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling. if you want a very-well made military simulator, offering wonderful graphics, processor-melting situations, teamwork, tension and combined-warfare operation, arma 3 is for you.",4

"fantastic mil-sim with a huge modding community and a wide variety of gamemodes. if you want to bomb a plane into a prison on a life mod, go ahead! if you want to lead you team of tanks the the forest moving everything down, you can do that too! this game is brilliant and i would highly recommend that you pick it up if you dont have it. try out some gamemodes and experiment with some mods and find out what suits you best. 12/8 m8",3
"great for people who love military sims. this game is best for people who go all out tactical and are clever enough to direct attacks. the campaign is very detailed and makes you feel attached to the characters. it is also a great way to get used to the mechanics of arma 3! the multiplayer has amazing team connectivity and makes you feel like you are actually part of a team. the tactical part of this game includes uavs, quad-rotors, and ulvs. i would not recommend this game to people who play call of duty because this game requires pure skill, patience, and toughness. if you have a computer with low graphics power, dont get this game. it includes two islands named stratis and altis, with altis being the largest one. altis may cause a  of lag due to its size, so play on stratis if you have a  computer.",2
"i have a brand new $3000 alienware computer and this game lags, tried putting the grafics on min did not work, then tried to use the games auto setting still did no work. to best describe the lag, its smooth for 8 seconds and lags for 4 seconds, and never stops that cycle, extremley annoyning, game seems fun but unplayable do to this, big waste of money do not buy.",1
"arma 3 is a military sim junkies dream. you can create any scenario you want. the best missions to play are those that you can download from the community created content. the game is a wip with ongoing iterations. best part is the multi-player experience. worst part is the ai experience.",5
"really fun game to play with friends many gamemodes/mission files to choose from great community :)",3
"it took forever to download and was a complete waste of seven hours of my life",1
"if theres any game i like, its arma 3 with its amazing gamplays. arma 3s singleplayer is fun, but i think multiplayer is the best",1
"off to a bit of a rough start, but all the core elements are sound and the engine has been done quite well. buy it not as a standalone game, but as a military sim platform - good things are on the way here.",1

"another great adition to the arma collection! arma 3 is closer to the most perfect action simulation i have tryed lots of new additions are included in this one. a nice touch with scuba diving and mine disarming, ai are realy on the ball, too die is very easy too :-( nice touch of wiled things around the map including the odd snake or too. bound to bite if close enough so stay clear. anouther darn head ach to tend too he he. just a thought.. ..maybe some hard core bomb disposal & disarming in the next mod or too please? 10/10 for this arma 3 thanks!",1
"i only have 4 favorited games in my library. this game is one of them.",3
"this is truly the best f.p.s game out there its my dream game and its better than cod and battlefield.",1
"im not sure, this game was in beta test for quite a short time, yet in alpha test for a decade (bought it in alpha). now, youd expect almost all the issues/bugs would be removed in the beta state, yet not with this one. it still is riddled with bugs and most of the vehices arent even added. when i made this review, there was only 1 plane, yet there are choppers/tanks, but considering their recent titles that one plane isnt enough especially when the games actually not optimized properly and still causes lag issues on multiple platforms in multiplayer. not to mention they didnt have the single player features (campaign) added, it was added about after a month when the game was already released. these things should of had all been done in beta!",1
"very fun. campaign is amazing and multiplayer! better then some of the call of dutys!",1
"its fun if you play it with friends or with a clan. by yourself - its worthless.",5
"great game but the fact that they didnt have the campaign ready when it shipped was kind of lame. i got it for 15 bucks when it was in alpha, awsome markiting.",1
"arma 3 is the biggest pile of  i have ever played. it is the worst game engine on the planet and is not optimized at all. it makes gaming pc explode. its terrible like its gameplay! do not buy this game at all, for your own safety!",1
"i say no simply because the arma 3 main game multiplayer (including wasteland) feels like it is still in beta with the amount of bugs, glitches, lag etc. it is worth it for the mods takistan life and altis life but i still wouldnt pay 35 for it. if its going cheap and your tempted? get it, otherwise avoid it. i still enjoy arma 2 more its smoother.",1
"if youre a call of duty  dont get! this game is even more massive and beautiful. only complaints are the low frames and futuristic setting. otherwise its a great game. with mods like altis life and wasteland theres so much to do in this military sandbox!",3
"joined altis life. met man willing to assist me. trusted man. man gets gun. man ties me up. man steals pants. 10/10 would get pants stolen again.",1
"really fun and realistic game, i just wish setting up servers that work were a little easier...",1
"absolutely fantastic combined arms simulator. if you prefer realistic approach to military games, this one is for you. 2 beautiful open islands to fight on, many weapons and technical to use. what i liked over the older instalments is enhanced movement and stance system, where you have more stances to adapt to the enviroment.",1
"concept and everything else about the game is pretty awesome. only downside is getting 5-15 fps no matter what your setup is. if you dont mind playing a game with 5-15 fps then go for it. otherwise its definately not worth the 60 dollars, more like 20-30",1
"i need help i got a big lg tv and on arma the fps gose down i was thinking if i get a pc screen would that help the fps im playing on a lg big tv but every time i look up at the sky the fps gose up to 50 i get 30 fps on very high so what u think if i get a pc screen would that help the fps ????",3
"arma 3 is a amazing game perfect for people that love first person shoots and 3rd its best sim going",1
"highly recommened for people who love rpg games or action games. feels like real life war, but into a game. worth the money.",1
"if you are creative and enjoying creating your own missions and playing with your friends you will like this game. the community has made some great mods for this game also.",5
"i know this game is awesome, but its super hard to run it!",1
"arma 3 in summary is simply brilliant! there are so many game modes and role playing games which lie within this game to keep you wanting to come back to this game! along with a good community which mods and creates more fantastic games and scenarios to play the game looks great and sounds amazing along with the physics to the most part very good and the military simulation is epic and also intense but very fun to plan your strategic tactics to ultimately finish whatever goal you are faced with arma 3 is great alone or with friends you can guarantee that the mass amount of time which you will spend on this game is spent well as the pricing of this game is fairly high arma 3 is addicting and i would recommend this game to anyone! 9.5/10",1
"arma 3 is and will be the most real life battles.nothing says real like getting caught between friendlies and combatants at the same time.bullets fly as bodies fall.love it and only wish for more.",1
"i love military games and this is a great one. this is good to get u to think mentaly and in every shape and form for exmaple u have to kill a guy so u and ur team go though this mission and u get hit and u r like should i heal. but other then that it gets hard and it makes u think. i love this game the story is great like i wont more of it every day i wake up its a great game. ben kerry is a great main soilder and i love playing as him and hes just great. i love this game. u will like this game if u like battlefeild and thinking thourg problems and getting the job done.",1

"this game is a waste of money.... its the buggiest game i ever played, sounds are late like mexican movie... player gets tired like he has a hangover, and the ai its on speed, its almost impossible to catch up... man just dont buy this game i wasted 40 bucks on this terrible game....",1
"ive been a fan of this series since operation flashpoint. arma3 is simply an incredible experience, visually stunning with environmental and visual features thats yaw dropping, gameplay that allows you to setup and experience an amazingly wide range of scenarios. i highly recommend getting into this fantastic gaming experience. this is one of the best investments i have ever made, getting more than 450 hours + gameplay. also, the modding community are very active and passionate, so the replayability is guarenteed.",3
"my most anticipated releas eof the year! after being an arma 2 junkie for years this fulfills my wishes and brings the arma series to the modern age, also i have to add that this game is probly the most beutiful game ive seen to date. highly modable, sandbox, multiplayer experiance. 10 out of 10 !",2
"if you like battlefield 3 or 4 for the graphics it has, youll appreciate this game. its a really different game though, if you have ever played arma 2 youll find yourself loving this game. when this was in beta i really hated it, regretted paying money for it at all, but then i realized it was a work in progress. the game has really been patched up a ton, the game is located in greece, on an island which actually exists in real life, look that up if you like, its awesome. anyway, when you are alone, not in combat and just walking into a little town and just listen to the ambient sound, youll fase off into another reality. i am not kidding, this doesnt feel like a game at times, playing on role-play servers really adds to that. tldr; great graphics. controls are wonky but thats the engine to blame, its the same engine as arma 2 if i am not mistaken, but once you get used to it its great. mod support is great as well, a lot of fun to be had. multiplayer is fully working, it has its flaws but nothing gamebreaking. hackers ive yet to be annoyed by, nothing too dramatic. price is a tad high, but knowing that black-ops is still rather pricey after a few years of being on the shelves, i think its a fair price since this game is better to begin with. definitely worth buying.",1
"best military simulation of all time. best fps of all time. 10/10. would love to see ace mod for this game like arma 2.",1
"hey, such an amazing game i really love almost 99.9% of the things in it and especially the way this game allows you to download modified data from 3rd parties and apply it to the game which is the best thing ever. one thing though, when the game spy program used to exist on the multiplayer server engines i used to be able to create a server of my own without any lags, now i cant, well i could but not anymore, i was told to open a port for the game but, the problem is that, everytime i open up a server, pick the port and put up the number of the maximum joining players with the name and hit okay, the game freezes and id have to use the task manager to shut it down and re-start it, id apprecciate a little bit of help or, at least a solution for such problem in the upcoming patches. thank you bohemia intractive, you lads rock!",4
"beautiful graphics, incredible content in game and via steam workshop a lot of mods available online, a must have for people looking for another kind of shooter or military enthusiast not fast paced, incredibly insane feeling when you cant even see the enemy and youre being shot at 10/10",1
"i just started playing and im hooked.this is by far one of the best simulators ive ever played . i am recommending this game if you are into shooters. the realism of arma 3 is amazing. this is no call of duty or battlefield.",1
"for someone not big on shooters, this game amazed me. its definitively a game, because its tons of fun, but many would rather call it a simulator - in this game i have stayed hidden in the bushes watching an enemy squad pass by, not to ambush them but simply to survive, and adrenaline was sky high the whole non-combat encounter. cant even describe the battles, except awesome. pros: so realistic in many aspects many roles to play, from civillian, to infanterist, to pilot, to general, and every step between. huge - insanely huge - maps (up to 200km squared!) many ways to play, play sp military missions, online mp missions, mp pvp, sp/mp sandbox pvp/pve and even rp! your own powerful (complex) mission editor - user-created content galore! mods! mods! mods! mods! mods! so much more... check out vids by dslyecxi or jester14 on youtube for good insight cons: steep learning curve first time, complex (though well-working) controls demanding for your hardware on graphical high settings and rendering distances (>4km) seems to have some time-space-twisting effect where hours dissappear into adrenaline-ridden joy one of my all-time favorites. and i dont like many shooters.",1
"this is by far the most technical, realistic and best military shooter game on the market. i recommend this game to anyone who is looking to be immersed into the world of combat. jump in and enjoy, but is like whiskey, you will either like it or hate it.",2
"really fun game if you like fps or shooters. super realistic can be buggy though.",1
"arma 3, and absolute major achivement by bohemia interactive! i am glad to say that this game has been my favourite game for quite some time and i strongly advise you to purchase this product if you havet already. buying the digital deluxe edition of this game gave me all the arma 3 game music which i thought was pretty cool considering the music is high def.",2
"i love this game and the community but i really wish the dlc wasnt so expensive... great game if youve got a bunch of friends and a bit of cash to spend.",1
"so there i was.... in the middle of a tdm server... i loaded up with my favorite sniper rifle and ghille suit which was not useful in any way, and spawned in the middle of the firefight. and then what happened? 360 no scope like a baws cod style!........ just kidding, i died instantly. if you want a first-person/3rd-person shooter game that isnt ridiculously  and made like a michael bay movie, then arma 3 is the game for you. im telling you, this game is one of the most realistic (if not the most) war games you will ever find out there. battle on atlis(arma 3 world) takes everything into account - how much gear youre carrying and how heavy it is (because with the new fatigue system, well trained soldiers have been transformed into chain-smokers), with sniping you have to take into account the wind speed, distance, and elevation; stealth tactics and just basic common sense. if youre the one who likes going in guns blazing with explosions everywhere expecting to get a triple kill, then youre in for a rude awakening when you try this game.",1
"anyone know why altis life isnt working... it says im missing a file or something",3

"arma 3 is one of the best selling fps sandbox games ever made. some of those people come from arma 2 or arma 1 but most people i know, arma 3 was their first arma game. from flying helicopters to infantry rush. arma 3 has a huge community and is still growing today! also not to note the spectacular performance by the dev team update almost weekly. the best thing i love about aroma is there always going to be something new each time you play from altis life to the realism units. friend me if you want to see some screenshots of arma 3 ~macmaster",3

"if you liked arma 2, even just a tiny bit, you will love this game!",1
"downloaded arma, and then opened it. proceeded to do a horrible tutorial, but after that, it was just beautiful. opened an rpg server, and ran 2 miles to get to an atm, and ran 2 miles to a shady car salesman. bought a car, spent the next half hour trying to figure out how to actually get into it. after i finally managed to glitch into it, i underestimated its ability to travel at light speed, which in turn caused me to crash into a wall. after that, my car was a smoking mess, with a top speed that a sloth could outdo. 10/10 would crash again",1

"very high quality. outranks cod, battlefield, and moh in my book.",1
"do you like a good shooter? are you a strategist? are you more inclined to play on hardcore servers in other games when you get the chance? then this might just be the game for you. the realism and beauty in arma 3 will blow you away. with heaps of multiplayer game modes avaliable for you to play, there will certainly be one that you will enjoy! and if multiplayer isnt your thing, then why not download one of the many custom made, high quality scenarios created by the community? steam workshop integration allows for endless fun, on scenarios that you can enjoy alone, or with friends! this is a game you really must try.",2
"one of the best combat simulators ive ever played!!!! the modding community is wonderful and supportive! this is a must have!",1
"slow-paced and heavily strategic/tactical. its a game that may not be fun, but it can be very immersive and tries to give you a breathtaking experience. if youre one of those guys that likes hardcore realistic simulation, then this game is definitely the best out there. also its more than just a game, its a platform that has plenty of mods to keep you busy when the original theme of the game is not quite what youre looking for.",1

"if youve loved any of the franchise... this one is just the next step in the evolution of the game. the game, in my opinion, seems to play smoother, the ai is a bit smarter, although it still seems like the enemy ai can spot you with ridiculous ease. with the community creating content, the possiblities for this game are endless. i kind of miss the realism of current existing weapons and vehicles and technology, but being set in the near future also gives the developers some creativity as well, and some of the included technology makes for an interesting experience. the campaign seems decent (at time of writing ive only played through the first installment). but the real meat of this game comes from user created content. for anyone who has never played any game in the franchise (arma, arma 2, operation flashpoint etc) this game has quite a large learning curve. that being said... all of the games have had the learning curve. but you have to start somewhere, with a bit of time and dedication, this game can and will be one of the most intense and realistic combat immersion experiences youll ever find.",2
"fun tactical game. dayz has made it to it so makes it twice as fun. play it for your opinion.",1
"a massive improvement from arma 2 (especially the voice acting). but i find the main dissapointment is the lack of weapon diversity and choice unlike arma 2. overall an amazing game well worth the price.",1
"this game is one-of-a-kind. you can have so much fun with it, because of its unique gameplay. the events that you will experience in this game cannot be compared to any other game (for example cod or battlefield). you will fear the enemy when the blood in your veins pump with adrenaline when youre shot at! it may have a lot of glitches but that shouldnt be a problem because of the many priviliges you get when buying this game. 9/10 - best of its kind",1

"very realistic military detail. accurate radio chatter, sounds, and ballistic mechanics. use of tactics is vital unlike call of duty and that crap where you shoot your way through everything. if you want to immerse your self in a lifelike warzone experience wait till this game is on sale and buy it.",1

"arma2 has much more content and is far more realistic (only medic can heal and it takes a while, weapons acting as real life counterparts, in arma3 everything is balanced and you can self-heal in 3 seconds by clicking a proper button). arma2 has also more vehicles, more weapons, more everything... really, there is nothing to go for arma3 except a bit better graphic, but this is hardly anything important, especially because arma2 looks not much worse. moreover its been over three months since the release date and the game still has unfinished campaign and terrible ai bugs. you dont have to take my word for it, watch a video:",1

"an undeniably accurate military simulator, no other game like it (yes, cod boys and bf fans, this is very different indeed). developed by actual military personel, this game is designed to be as realistic to military combat, tactics, and realismas humanly possible. ive played arma ii for years and never did i imagine a game, designed for the sole purpose of military simulations, take on the challenge of becomeing a modern day platform of arma iii.",1
"unrefined and jerky -- describes every aspect of this game. even with the settings turned down the animations are horrible and the guns are garbage - i cant even hit a window on the side of a building. bohemia needs to take some pointers from other shooters, refine the animations, fix the guns so they actually can shoot someone, and fix the jerky animations and lag so that whopever you shoot at, is not ghosting and jerking around like someone having a seaizure. i wouldnt even call this and alpha build and this game has been out for years -- no excuses at this point. i want my money back, this game is garbage.",1

"ok, yes i would recommend this game but in the vanilla campaign you seem to be a revolutionary insurgent instead of a nato infantry soldier. sort of special forces .. ish but without the nato aspect. create your own missions or join an online group and its a lot more realistic. its a shame that if you want to download player-made missions or join a clan you will have to heavily mod your game which can be a headf**k. so forget all those childish cod games etc. and get this game. the best milsim out there at the moment.",1

"this game is really cool i like king of the hill eerything about this game. i just get",1
"this game is very good. to start off i have started the campaign. but i spend most of my time on breaking point. i run settings at ultra and get around 60 fps. multplayer maps are twice to sometimes 4 times as big as the largest map in battefield. any map can be created by any user im you own zeus. this game just keeps getting better and better as i play it.",1
"terrible.!!! do not buy... just terrible..... has to many glitches!",1
"great military simulator, which will make you play for many hours with all the stuff do. the game looks really good for the huge map, and if you have friends to play with the games fun factor completely changes. you can plan operation and do them with your friends and you will feel like you are actually in the army. (but then you realize you sitting on your chair yelling at your friends through the mic.) everyone should get this game, not just because it is great fun, because it shows true teamwork and co-ordination. hope this helped with your decision :)",3
"solid game. im disappointed they didnt polish it up a bit more before launch, but overall its an enjoyable experience and one that ive put a lot of time into. just make sure your pc can run it smoothly.",1
"i highly recommend arma 3 if youre into army games with a (high) sense of realism. you can make this game as awesome as you want yourself. depending on which (modded) gamemodes you play or with who youre playing. im part of one of the largest arma 3 clans out there (joint task force 2) and it really adds to the experience, having a tactical realism based clan. think of stuff like basic training, military rank structure, working with a chain of command, teamplay based on military tactics and manoeuvers etc. check us out over at",3
"frustrating hard game,even putting on easy settings didnt help.trying to play online is a bit naff as well,everyone just boots you off server.not very friendly at all it seems.its just a walking in a pretty forest simulator at the moment :)",1
"great game to play especially in multiplayer with friends. the combat system is top notch and the graphics are great if you have a good enough pc to run the game in multilayer. the game has its flaws at times with fps dips on some servers but if you can get past that, the game is amazing. the mods for this game is where it shines for me personally. mainly the wasteland mod and the life mod. on the right servers you will find yourself hundreds of hours of fun easily just by how tense the game can get. my recommendation is to only buy this game if you have a few friends who are willing to play with you. also, if you want to play wasteland only play on sa-matra servers, this way you can reach 60fps quite easily in ultra if your pc is good enough, otherwise you will have to play on the not so optimized regular wasteland servers with low fps (30-40 or less)",2
"bought this game on sale for $33 and was not dissappointed. ive played the second one and this one is just 10x better. once my exams are over im going to get so many hours on this amazing game! :d this is the story for my first day in altis life... i join a nice server which seemed to have nice people and they seemed to beonly rude to the cops. i am invited into a little group by this one guy to have some fun with.. 20 minutes later im in the back of a truck with a guy holding a gun to my face and im  my pants here.... so they take me into a hideout where they make me sing for them and then they kill me. as i wait for a medic im being t-bagged by like 10 people which is not cool. once the medic came they killed him too and started t-bagging him. i then respawned a new man with a horrible past :( great game overall :d 10/10",1

"amazing military simulation, this game is in my top 5. if you are looking for a game that has alot of replayability and a ton of game modes, you are looking at it. this game also has alot of different mods ranging from search and rescue to life mods.",1
"the best game i have ever played... unbeliavably realistic and just simply amazing, only took 1 hr to get that impression, get whilst u still can on 40% off, otherwise it is very expensive, but well worth it. the only problem is the fact u need a very good computer to run it on very high settings, which would make gameplay even better, however, my 2 year old laptop runs it well on high/standard settings mix. anyway, could rant on and on about how great this is, but basically... its mint",3
"this game is good specially when you go in to the ice age level and smash down a tree with a microwave.",1

"a relentless pseudo-turn based dungeon crawler, with no end of challenge. the game features only two immediate and apparent difficulties: too easy, and easy. dont let these difficulty titles fool you, theyre a lot more daunting than they seem. the dungeons are unforgiving, one mistake or failure to prepare can ultimately lead to your cascading loss of the dungeon. the already challenging difficulties can be further multiplied by selecting different escape pods that give new rules to your dungeon. the greatest enemy you will face in the dungeons isnt the monsters, its the random number generator. whats in the next room? monsters? dust? a much needed damage-per-second, or utility hero? maybe the room will be empty. who knows whats in store for you in the depths of the dungeons of the endless. this game is not for those who are looking for a casual dungeon crawler.",1

"ive had this game for quite a long time but never really found what to do with it.,..until i found altis life! wow! its so much fun roleplaying as a civ trying to find his way on altis island. if you like roleplaying and are open to all sorts of avenues that appear in front of you, then this is definitely the game for you! top drawer!!",3
"one of the best (if not the best) mil sim out there. dont expect a bf3/bf4 or call of duty cuz it nothing like those titles (thak god). plenty of mod support, and with just a few choice mods you have your self somthing really special. for those looking for a realistc fps/mil sim this will never let you down. woth every penny i actually bought this game for my borther just so we could play together and the coop is outstanding.i would buy evryone a copy if i had enough money everyone should be able to enjoy this game at least once. 5/5 stars :)",2
"excellent game plenty of multiplayer options to suit all styles of play although for full enjoyment i would reccomend playing with froends",4
"i have no clue what these game developers are doing. i got a 5930k 32gb ddr4 980 gtx x 2 in sli a rampage v extreme motherboard, and this game wont run much over 30 fps for me. i put everything on low, and still 24 fps. autodetect did something right, but still not over 30-40 fps. and its not even super pretty. the game might be good, but the optimalization just is so bad its insane. i wonder what graphics the rest is playing on, because this is . neither of my 980 gtx will go over 911 mhz either, while playing it. so it stutters, while not utilizing the graphic cards. i want my money back, its a bad code-simulation.",1

"arma iii: pros: + most realistic military simulation / shooter there is on the market + unlimited stuff to do/to try => endless fun + really big maps + buggy as hell (trademarks of arma) cons: - buggy as hell (but still, they are annoying) - needs alot of good hardware to work properly. (im playing with 30 fps standard) evaluation: armas trademarks are the bugs in this game. youll get used to them and sometimes they are really funny. anyway, this game makes just fun when played on a high-tech computer, otherwise you may get depression. conclusion: it is really worth every buck, because if you play with friends its undefeatable fun.",2
"ghostieproductions arma 3 review overview: a simply amazing game. including an editor, a manual covering the game, its engine, and also tips and tricks, you come prepared when purchasing this game. if you are a fan of singleplayer, then you can be sure to be happy when purchasing this game. it includes a 3-part campaign, along with showcases of each of the aspects of the game. the multiplayer is a massive amount of gamemodes, with small gangs of players trying to escape from overwhelming amounts of enemies, to massive amounts of players fighting each other, or cooperating to exterminate the other ai presence. pros: -great graphics, visually stunning, well drawn -audio feedback is pleasing to the ears -well designed weapons -realistic ballistic system -accurate vehicular controls -accurate damage system -overall fun to play -customizable hud cons: -not a very good story (you can make your own, though.) -hard to tell the health of your player, meaning that its hard to differentiate from you being just fatigued, and about to bleed out. mods can fix this issue. -selection system is flunky, using a mouse wheel is not ideal in combat situations. verdict: i am happy to give this great sandbox shooter a 9/10. the dlcs are not required to experience the hours of fun available from this game. enjoy.",2
"this game is extremly good. i recomend it to anyone that like roleplaying games.",3
"this is a great game, the developer (bohemia interactive) clearly know what they want to do with themselves and their games. their content is all very high quality, everything from the world, to models, to texture, to most mechanics are all very well fleshed out and realized. for a simulator, this game is astounding, and engaging. imesrion ranges from cod to crying over the death of a squadmate. however! if you cannot quickly find yourself a group or squad to play with, this game will quickly become a bore. my only disapointment is their stubbornnes to not fix the action menu. feel free to watch dslyecxis video for more information. 9/10 if you can find your niche, and if you dont mind the action menu. please do not pick up this game however if you are not a fan of military simulators. are you a cod/battlefield/cs:go fanboy who doesnt appreciate other styles of shooters? this may not be for you.",1

"call of dutys more educated and respectable older cousin. an fps for the thinking man who appreciates the real life brutal realities of combat. this game doesnt grab your hand and guide you to its breast, this game makes you work for your entertainment. treat this game right, take the time to understand its nuances, and never underestimate its bite, and youll have a much more rewarding experience than you can achieve with most fps games. when a mission is carried out via your own strategic wit and whim, and hours are spent infiltrating and avoiding enemy patrols so that you can make it to that perfect firing position for your sniper, it really makes that one shot a lot more heart pounding than any round fired in any other military shooter. if you have adhd, watch wrestling, appeared on jerry springer, think call of duty is a good game, and/or are the offspring of two genetically similar parents, you will not enjoy this game.",1
"the game is very immersive and you will get some unique experience in it. sometimes even the simplest scenario (you hiding from an enemy while waiting for rescue) can become really intense. i recommend if you buy/have the game you should try out tee times warfare (somewhat like conquest in battlefield but with a currency to buy your own vehicles) and wasteland which can become very hardcore, always expect the enemy to have a tank when you only have a pistol, very interesting. also the majority of the people you will meet in the game are helpful and nice people that are ready to cooperate with you. its always nice when the community is like this.",4

"this game is a great improvement on arma 2. first off the graphics on this game are amazing there are so many stunning sites to see as you battle across the islands of alits and stratis. secondly the voice acting has been greatly improved and it no longer feels like you are in command of robots on top of that squad command and high command has been improved making it easier to control large numbers of ai. the downside to this game over arma 2 is there is currently only one jet and there are no large helicopters for mass troop transport and the campaign is not coop which was a disappointment.",1

"though i have not palyed this for the longest time, i have always been a fan of the arma series. i actually really like what they did with their newest game. it still pertains the original arma feel, but there have been a few changes from arma 2 i do not like. for example, i played alot of the campaigne and i find it strang how they made it that you die after about 2 shots (one to the head, three to the limbs), yet when i shoot an npc in the torso, it takes about half a magazine. i remember in arma 2 that the npcs had the same damage system as you. also, i feel that the first aid kits are a little bit cheap. in arma 2 if you didnt have a medic in your squad, or you wernt near a medical tent, you were screwed if you got shot, you would either crawl your way home if you were shot in the legs or shoot like a lawn sprinkler if you got shot anywhere else. im not saying its a bad game, in fact its a very good game, but previous arma fans be warned, there will be some things that will possibly get under you skin.",1

"release disappointment. campaign disappointment. bugs disappointment. i upgraded from a quad core at 3ghz to a oct core at 4 ghz and it still has poor performance in cities/fights, irrregardless of graphical settings. the problem is that bis is getting away with putting out an incomplete game because of dev apologists who instead of recognizing the core issues that bis has, they apologize it with modders with add/fix that. so why am i paying for a game that wont be finished until modders have plugged their hard work into free fixes? why not just get a modding community to make the better arma? since they do it outside of the company anyway? the thing is, many, many loyal community members pleaded with bis to remove the issues arma 2 had, with arma 3. but they didnt. i just cant agree with those ethics. i still play arma 3 because there is nothing like it. but just because there isnt anything like it doesnt mean it is the best it could be. far from it.",1

"you only buy arma 3 for the mods. the rest of the game and missions are lacking allot! but if you like altis life and other mods, then this is the game for you. but the net-code is just as bad or worse then bf4 so keep that in mind. but this is not a dice/ea game so you should buy it and teach ea a lesson!",2

"having been a counter-strike player for many years and loving it, i stumbled across an arma 2 video on youtube and was engrossed, i watched a few of them and the total difference between cs and arma was obvious to me, arma brought realism which is what i was missing from counter strike, so i checked the steam store for prices and noticed that arma 3 was due for release, so i hung fire and awaited the first arma 3 videos and knew that it was the game that i wanted. well! arma 3 is now owned and its as rock solid as any shooter ive owned with one exception, arma 3 actually makes me feel as though im in the actual game, i feel like a real soldier with a real mission, long gone are the days where i just run around a small map blasting anyone who gets in my way or dying and respawning, arma 3 is tactical, you have to think about every move you make because if you run around like an idiot, then you die like an idiot, arma 3 is starting to define me as a player and my goal...... is to stay alive and fight another day. arma 3 gets a rock solid 10/10 from me.",2
"fantastic game! this is not your typical cod or bf, this game requires patience, and wit. once you master those things, this game rewards you with a marvelous experience. the single player campagn is lengthy and challenging, tons of custom content, missions and not to mention the expansive multiplayer experience. i enjoy playing multiplayer coop the most in this game. working together is very rewarding and essential if you want to survive. its rare for a game to be so engaging that i keep coming back to it. 10/10",3
"great game. i recomend this gme to anione that loves a very intence & realistick war game.",4
"well... to start off im not a very big third person fan but with this game i think it beats all first person shooters. i have now logged over 400 hours with in the first months of owning this game. this is by far the most adictive/relistic warfare game i have yet found on the internet or (steam) this game re-defines warfare to omg need more, i highly recomend this game to all who like warfare. p.s. in order to have loads of fun get a group of friends or forum a group to play with",4
"good for altis life, little else to say thats good.",1
"one of the best pc games i have played only down sides are the optimisation is pretty bad but apart from that awesome game",2
"arma 3 is a real game with all the workshop items and dlcs and game modes that expands the game i rate this a 10/10",1
"amazing graphics, realistic and fun what else to say apart from 10/10 :)",3
"realistic (more so than any other shooter), teambased, and an overall good battlefield game. now if only they could improve the netcode and fix the desync...",1
"arma 3 is a big fail.not in alpha state but definitely not completed. game changes from update to update,also addons stop working with new version.you might say its normal because new version has fixed the bugs.wrong again.new version go on conflict with addons that worked very well from day 1,as for bugs...stil not solved,very often fps drops and connection issues between client and server. gameplay...lame...for 2015 arma 2 was a big hit. arma 3 is another version on arma 2 with new tweaks. annoying dlc screen while flying in vehicles from dlc.",5
"great all around combat sim. if youve played arma since the beginning then im sure your loving this one too. if you havent played arma then, well, what the hell are you waiting for!",4
"if you dont buy this game, (especially on sale) your an idiot!",1
"i dont even have this game, why is it allowing me to write a review?",1
"i loved this game i wish you fix the friendlyfrire thing and the hackers even with the anticheat system thiers hackers bersides that i have a problem with third person veiw",1
"i love the game but the helicopter controlls are a little confusing but i highly reccomend this game to everyone who likes military style games this is the one for you.",1
"arma 3 has a lot of potential and im hoping it will be devoloped into a beautiful game just like arma 2 is/was. i havent played all the mods /yet/ but king of the hill and battleroyale is looking verry promising. really do like what they have done and love the feeling that u get when u are shooting and getting shot by somone, i mean like the sound is just <3 <3 <3 ... 8/10",1
"this game is amazing but does have its moments online co-op like getting shot through walls. but this game is well worth the money even though its in alpha its has so much to offer for the engine platform it uses is amazing. the graphics are outstanding for multiplayer. over all i would give the game a 7 out of 10 on campaign and a 10 out of 10 on multiplayer just because the campaign is kinda hard in the beginning of it the multiplayer you have a good community of players on the coop. i just love it i will keep playing this game until bohemia interactive comes out with arma 4 if they do it will be hard to top this game and the cooperation of other players. they just need to add more stuff but its still in alpha.",3
"pretty mean, lacking content but, content can always be made and added. gameplay is outstanding!",4
"brilliant! immersive! huge sandbox! a must buy i say!",3
"one of the best games i have played related to the military,there is so much you can do. the team work that goes on here in arma is awesome.",1
"this game is amazing, the sounds just feel so real, the graphics are amazing and the fact that there are so many mods that can enhance the game even more is fantastic",1
"this is meant to a realistic simulator right? so far ive only got a huge free smulation of complete lag. done with arma 2+3, for the love of god do not make another game bohemia..youre base game sucks and the mods only suck half as bad..",1
"the sound is completly brocken and i cant hear any thing",2
"great game, very good war simulator also very fun to play with friends. 5/5",2
"i would recommend the game as played with friends. campaign alone for example is ing pain in the . the ai companions are  and enemies seem to be at most points superhumans. i mean they aim ridicilously well and they see even the slightest movement in a bush from one click away. i mean, seriously? then you drop player alone in the middle of these superhumans. fun, eh? well yeah, if your ing physics would actually work and the forest and bushes would actually cover something. i played opf series from the start and arma series from the start, but this campaign and the ai in it is the absolutely worst. but in the other hand when played with friends (with a lot of frieds) it is a good game. player versus player massive multiplayer matches are fun. their little ing  campaign is not.",2
"very neet military game ever developed. extremly good to create you own army :) and play it with many steam friends.",1
"amazing and submersive game. there are quite a few bugs, but they arent enough to make the game non enjoyable.",3
"shot down a helicopter with lightning as zeus. 1/0",1
"if you like your military sims this has to be the daddy! also add mods to your game and obtain even more playability. one game i will recommend to anyone.",1
"so far its pretty much the best milsim out there, bar none. i do wish for a mod to include realistic reloading animations and a mechanic that recognizes bullets in the chamber. negatives are the extreme amount of wasteland servers out there, and complete lack of proper pvp servers that are friendly for playing without friends. for better or worse, unless you, for some inexplicable reason, actually like the wasteland mod, youre better off playing the co-op servers where its you, 20 or so other folks, customizable loadout ammo crates, and places on the map to clear of enemy ai. game looks good, and its a real treat for such a milsim to look good, and have alot of potential draw distance.",2
"amazing game so far and its only an alpha! updated and improved on so many things from previous arma games. if you like miltarty simulators this game has you covered; infantry, boats, vehicles and aircraft. huge maps (20km) and you can pretty much go in to any building now! in short, pre-order this game :d",1
"even worsely coded than arma 2 somehow, looks like it was optimized by chimps using their feet.",1
"i purchased this for the epoch mod and only play for that, the mechanics are fantastic and the graphics are incredible. although the game and mod have a ways to go yet, still much fun to be had. worth every penny... highly recommend.",2
"watch the video myted while listening to x ambassadors jungle",1
"got robbed then drop out of airplane and landed on cop car. 10/10",3
"i recommend this game!! it is already in beta!! :d",1
"do something wrong? repeat after me, gunshot gunshot gunshot im dead! do everything right but standing an inch too far to the left? repear after me, gunshot gunshot gunshot im dead! do everything right while sitting in the right place? repeat after me, need ammo! do everything right while sitting in the right place and still have ammo? i dont know i never did that in the demo. but im going to get this game.",1
"i killed someone on a go kart with a lightning bolt, then i killed another guy by putting several planes on him that glitched and blew up. buy this",1
"i only played it once in the editor but it was really fun so i recomend this game",1
"ater around 150 hours of playing this game i firmly say it is worth the money.",3
"high learning curve but a very rewarding experience.",1
"tking, bossy 12 year olds, no explaination on what to do. really a dumb game",1
"1/10 you can also do this irl, so why would you do it here? :p !!! xd!! memes",1
"do you want a game where mim req. dont matter and everyone gets the same fps?! try arma! nah, its an amazing game i suggest getting into a realism unit since playing alone is like masterbating at a mcdonalds.... lonely.",3
"trained combat operators with the cardio of obese 3rd graders. 11/10.",1
"supports the new unreal engine 4 with best bugs ever and flying spazzing cars with rollercoaster effects you have never seen before. yes",3
"you dont need it anymore theres a standalone for dayz",1
"a better version of arma 2, but needs more content for its price point. if you are gonna buy this just to play single player, wait, but if you wanna fun game you can spend hours blowing your friends up in, this is the game for you. so in a sense, 12/3",2
"its hard on noobs. it was for me. but as soon as i found out the basics i had so much fun!",1
"i reccomend getting arma 3 it is the best military/fps game i have ever played",1
"its really cool and fun! until someone hacks your favorite server and you cant play it anymore. good game bad community",1
"tried shooting the enginer so he would repair my helicopter and was killed by my squad. 10/10",1
"i absolutely love this game. there is so much to do and explore, the sky is the limit! i wish my computer ran the game enough, but i definately got my use out of it. it is very easy to set up scenarios with friends, such as rading a town or completeing a close air support mission. all in all, an absolutely amazing game.",1
"arma 3: the only military fps you need along with arma 2. lots of mods via steam work shop and a ever vast developement team updating and improving it. with games like altis life which you can be a criminal or cop depending on what server. ride go karts dlc needed lots to do.",1
"this is a very good game experience! ~i have to admit that, it brought me a lot of surprises .almost no end game content ,gigantic map and unique simulation experience! i just love it. ignto his score is 7.0 ,but i gave him the score is 9.0 maybe i was the reason it military fans... i really like this game mode~",1
"not the game for me, it has very good graphical detail but that is about it. multiplayer is very laggy and borderline unplayable, controller support is listed as a feature however only a select few controls can be mapped to it - making playing with it extremely difficult. i bought into it when it was 20 in early alpha, i would not pay 40 for it now, and im glad i didnt.",1
"well.... arma... i have been wanting to play arma for the past 5 years but never had the computer to run it but as soon as i got a new computer i picked this game up straight away! i was not dissapointed either as it is as close as you can get to real war without going there yourself... it has everything! excpet a lot of jets, they need more jets...",1
"the ultimate military sandbox game in this planet, galaxy, universe!!!",1
"definietly not worth the money. dissapointment of the year 2013, offers nothing significantly new nor is it even that good of a game overall. i regret getting this game, while arma 2 is probably one of my best purchases ever.",1
"having followed this franchise since its original appearance as operation flashpoint back in the late 90s it struck me as game to follow, and for good reason. it wasnt a game about running in guns blazing (although youre welcome to give that a go), it was a simulation of what war is like, where one minute you could be running through a field with your squad to hold the town and then the next you get clipped by a bullet from got knows where because you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. if you want a game that is a corridor shooter, with arcade reflexes and regenerating health, then this isnt the game for you. if you like a challenge, like realism and immersion then deffinately give this a go. on another plus side, the devs are always updating this franchise with patches and has one of the best modding communities out there. if the devs havet done it yet, then the modding community more than likely has.",1
"got 15 fps to listen to two people scream at new players while we made a tactical blob of human bodies and drowned the enemy in our own corpses. 10/10 best napoleanic war simulator.",1

"unbelievable game. the sheer amount of mods (some of them are even downloaded automatically, you dont need to do anything, except for joining a server) is just mind blowing. its a definite must-have for all fps fans. next to the obvious advantages like day-z, there are also really really great mods like wasteland. in wasteland (i only play that mod, it fulfills all my fps/action/adrenaline/survival needs) you play on either one of two teams, which fight each other, or you can choose to play a lone wolve who plays against everybody.... on the huge map of altis (really existing greek island) which is about 270km (yea really, you literally drive for hours and hours to get from one end to the other) you are left on your own, with only a pistol. you need food, water and equipment to stay alive. you may find them or you may have to keep looking. its the ultimate adventure for everyone who doesnt like the zombie-aspect of day-z (seriously, its fun until you killed 10 of these, then it gets boring). if you dont like some aspects of day-z or wasteland (or any other mod for that matter) than you just grap the code (mostly available on git repositories) and change what you need :) before i knew the potential of arma i bought bf4 and i really regret it. arma 3 is warmly recommended.",1
"the title of this game should be walking simulator 2013 instead of arma 3. thank god i played this during the free weekend, because if i bought this right away, i would have done anything to get my money back. multiplayer is quite basic and simple. spend 10 minutes looking for a car, drive 30 miles, find someone, get killed, repeat until you get some sense knocked into you. thats arma 3s multiplayer in a nutshell. realistic shooters arent always the best shooters, and this game proves that point. i honestly would have played call of duty: ghosts instead of this. on pc. thats how bad it is. dont buy this game, save your money. its not even worth buying during huge sales. if you want a survival shooter, get dayz, not this.",1
"the best authentic military sim available. graphics are amazing, high attention to detail for such a huge open world. this game, like the armas before it is virtually endless with all the user created mods and missions. if you are a military fan, with realism higher than kill count, then this is the game for you. the devs are some of the most involved in the business. there are glitches and bugs, but for the scope of the game, it is understandable, but they never stop fixing and adding to the game. watch a few videos of the gameplay and you get the feel for how intense it can be.",1
"love the game besides some server lag when you play online",5
"while it may have its fair share of bugs its still a great game. 10/10 would stick in pants.",1
"singleplayer: + smart a.i + can be hard + lots of missions and scenarios - story is not anything special or interesting multiplayer: + lots of servers + lots of players - server browser is slow -some servers need extra add ons to play -sometimes no servers come up in browser - can be laggy community: +can be helpful to new players + mods improve the game - alot of trolls - lots of hackers/ scripters gameplay: + can change attachments & clothes during a fight to help + driving is fun +/- controls for just about everything - very demanding game for hardware - can be buggy - guns sound the same - not enough guns (without mods) -cars flip too easily overall: 8.5/10 best if you play arma 3 with mods, vanilla game can get boring.",1
"its a game you would most probally hate initally but if you put your time into exploring things such as the editor or try out some of the amazing mods you will grow to love this series.",3
"arma 3 is more realistic in many areas, vs previous arma games. i would recommend it. but make sure you have a computer that can run it. the graphics settings are quite high.",1
"a really interesting sandbox. basically build a story on your own, or play other player-made maps... includes normal deathmatch, coop story games and anything that can be made with your imaginations(requires some level of programming though) only for those who are willing to learn how to play and not just point and kill, like counter-strike. recommend to play as a group.",1
"i love this game so much. amazing graphics and the lighting is fantastic. the physics are still crappy just like arma 2 and arma 2 oas but whatever, i love them.",3
"arma iii is a great game, entertainment and graphics wise. the workshop feature is pretty cool as well. being able to download player made missions, and derp around with vehicles and the wide variety of weaponry make the game fantastic. its not for everyone, not nearly as fast paced as cod, cs, and even bf. some of the stuff on the workshop are good enough to be games of their own. the scuba diving is awesome! 10/10",1
"although there were some troubles in the beginning this game has improved i love just playing this game vanilla (even though i have a  load of mods for it) plus the adding of workshop made this much better for the arma series",2
"i have played this game for a long time and have also played arma 2. i would call this game one of the best games out there. there is so many things that you can do that it just does not end. if you are looking for a new game to buy i would say arma 3 is a great chose.",3

"you cannot beat this military simulator. been a fan since 2001 & have nevr been disapointed by a release.",5

"i bought this game 2 weeks ago..... i have a problem. edit: 3 months in, 350 hours",3
"alot of bugs, almost as bad as arma2. pretty sights, cool environment, awesome maps. the game doeasnt feel finished yet, not enough vehicles,  controls...",1
"this is an awesome game to play. the developer team is really caring about the community. the workshop and map editor helps you to do a lot of things that no other games can. the hardward requirement is pretty high and you will not get the best experience if you can only run on low or medium. plus, if you one of those people who play cod or battlefield a lot, you may need a few hours to l2p this game. arma 3 is seriously an simulation game, any gun can pretty much 2 shot or 1 shot you at any distance(and the ai is pretty good at aiming). stay in cover, move quick and you will enjoy this war on the island.",1
"i recommend this game to all army fans out there, but 1 thing you have to keep in mind, very big game, you need a very good computer to run it. i warned you... final rate on game= 9/10 (needs more fps) community for this game is just fan--tas--tic... everyone is helpful and game is heaven for teamwork gameplay, il be honest, i get the chills when i play it.. -- gives you goose bumps -- -tytomgaming",3
"im really enjoying arma 3, i suggest and recommend highly!",1
"brilliant game but be sure to buy it on  as its really to exspensive for what you get. what you do get is a brilliant campaign, top of the line graphics. weapons, sounds, vehicles and the map are very well done! multiplayer is fun and easy to make friends on e.g (altis life) workshop includes a ton of content and mod support is crazy into-depth. i get lost in the maps theyre that big. however, this game is hard to run making expensive graphics cards seem like your entry cards, that may be a beta thing but you definatly wont have 60 fps unless you have a gtx titan. overall i reccomend this game 8/10 hours of fun",1
"this is an awesome game very fun to play with friends,great graphics, worth the price",1
"it is hard to make a review of this game. realistically, every single person is going to have a unique experience and it will vary. the one thing that i can say is that performance and physics wise it is much better than any of the previous armas; however, i think that it lacks the content arma 2 had. if you have time and patience you can mod the hell out of this game to make it into what arma 2 used to be. if not, well, youre gonna be stuck with futuristic looking vehicles, guns, and awkward looking csat uniforms. if you dont mind the futuristic style content than it should be fine. i personally loved arma for the cold war - modern era equipment and the asthetic realism of it all which this game failed to deliver until modded. regardless of that i still absolutely love this game and going to continue playing it for as long (at least) as it takes gaben to release hl3",3
"my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game, ever. were on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. im leading a team of 4 men. we come to a crossroad and i sprint across, telling my men to hold back. i cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. nothing. i run, my saw gunner runs, my medic runs. but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across. anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through? remember the sniper scene? the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down. he then takes two more in the chest. the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. he screams as hes being shot. crawling, drenched in his own blood. sarge? you aint leaving me out here like this, right? i-i wanna go with you guys! cmon sarge, h-help me! cmon! please dont leave me! he died after that. i cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.",2
"nothing is better for any military type game. this is very configurable and highly recommended by any player who has played it. give it time and you will be hooked and stuck to it. make sure you have a high end pc. game comes with plenty graphics and high use of cpu. enjoy it and join for something that will be put in history of game servers!",3

"i mean seriously? it may be a laggy piece of absolute cow . but its arma in 3. 420/10 would blaze.",1
"the best arma so far, but it is still quite clunky as a game. the ai is sooo much better than the previous versions. i wished dayz would have used the arma 3 engine. good graphics!",1

"typical arma: getting better all the time. some of the mods and addons are so clever you could be forgiven for thinking its arma4 not 3 ... already with steam workshop mods and addons ranging from simple missions to mind-blowing fully scripted conversions - there are always going to very large amount of mods and missions thanks to the familiar and easy to learn mission editor (easy to learn, hard to master), plus armatools for free. top quality addons from the community being added all the time- and you can use your other arma/arma2/oa/iron front/toh content via a mod called allinarma. as in all the previous arma mil-sims, eventually hardware and mid range systems are catching up to it about the same time community content gets slick and plentiful (as it is now for arma2). underwhelming as a pie down the trousers on first release, but turning into an great game.",2
"one of the best games i have ever played. once i started it i stopped playing anything else for a long time. the amount of options available is overwhelming, not to mentions how much you can do by yourself using the editor. the campaign is also very well designed and entertaining.",2
"nice game and very realistic ! maybe to realistic!",1
"if you are into a more in-depth type of shooter - with several community made mods/additions to improve upon the game and add to it - i highly recommend this game. the controls can be a little tough to get used to at first, and the maps are quite large. but a lot of fun can be had; especially with friends.",1
"together me and 2 friends did a bunch of drugs, drove into town square, then proced to run over a cop whilst smoking from my body from the marijuana. 11/10",1
"no one should have to pay 60 dollars for this game",1
"only played about an hour so far however, i have enjoyed that small time very much! way more realistic than arma ii, which i enjoyed as well. attachments, costume customization, ragdoll, graphics, swimming, extra animations and improved sniping adds for a great game... well done although, i cannot rate this yet. if youre looking for a war simulator, this is for you. the graphical optimisation still makes me want to vomit and i have not currently found the character customizer yet. snipe on!",1
"okay im going to keep this simple +graphics amazing imo + multi types of servers all fun from epoch to wasteland ect +amazing fun if you have friends and still fun on your own sneaking up on them and killing them all :0 +love the wep customization ect +prolly my most fav game on steam by far +never fully get bored of it all dlcs are 100% worth con but dont take these into consideration it still a great game -once in awhile you may notice a hacker -maybe the odd bugg but hay it dont ruin it completely",1
"bugs, hackers, glitches, unfinnished patches, unreleased vehicles, just right there would be enough to steer away anyone from purchasing this game. however, even with all that i still will play arma iii. the online multiplayer experiences are pheonominal, and definetly unique. if youve ever played massive online sandbox fps, for example, planetside 2, you will know the kind of online experiences to expect, however unlike other sandbox mmos, the experiences you get with arma, are changing. its not a repetitive, boring, same old grind. depending on what server you want to play on, you can find yourself, playing with other players against ais, using modern military tatics and utilizing resources to save a down player pilot, or you can find yourself running drugs in the cover of night trying to evade player police. as long as i have played arma iii, i cannot say that it has been boring for me. however this game is not for everyone, so if your not into the sandbox effect, i would continue on with your day, but if you enjoy unique experiences, and a endless interaction, then i highly recommend arma iii.",3
"stunning, stunning game, best in its genre by a country mile, nothing else comes close to this !",1
"there is just so much to do in the arma series that if youre a fan of first person shooters, there really is no reason not to have this simulation in your library. i may be a little bias since ive loved the arma series since the very early days of arma 2, but there is also very little not to love in any arma simulation. if the base game just isnt enough for you, theres also a few hundred mods you can install to make the experience funner and more immersive. i would recommend arma 3 to everyone, there is so many different roles to play offline and online itd be hard for you to not be able to enjoy the sim and have some fun.",1
"too much walking, not enough fighting. good simulation not a good shooter. just m.h.o.",1
"very good military sim, not as good as arma 2, but still very good",1
"this game is an amazing follow up to the second arma. a huge graphical improvemet, ui changes, and weirder keys replacing inventory with gernade, yeah that was fun to find out... another thing that makes this game amazing is the steam workshop, it adds, litteraly, hundreds of mods, missions and just fun things to do!",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. if you liked arma 2, youll love arma 3!!!",3
"the best thing in pc gaming back then was operation flashpoint. today its arma3.",1
"arma 3 is a good game. that if you havent played arma 2. this game doesnt have the same feel or the same look as arma 2. arma 2 is a better game in almost every way. this game feel likes it was cut short. it doesnt feel done. anyway, if you want a good arma game, go ahead and get arma 2 and operations arrow head. not a bad game, but arma 2 is much better. oh, and my i add this game is an fps hell. it doesnt play well at all, and its looks awful doing so",1
"do you want to feel like youre about to die, when youre actually not? do you want to feel the fear of almost being shot when you escape by just one hair? well arma 3 is the game for you, one of the most intense and nailbighting games ever. when you come so close to living the dream in altis life and you die can be annoying, but when you escape near death can be just as amazing as killing someone and picking up their loots! arma 3 is one, if not the greatest millitary sims ever! -ps you need a good pc. :p",1
"10/10. hands down my favorite game right now. the mods are just amazing.",3
"easily worth the price a military simulator with so many options. if you havent played arma before you will find the controls daunting but once you get used to them the game is great. the other issues can be de sync(lag) and low frame rate on some maps. this can make the game frustrating but the good times in this game out weigh the bad unlike some of the big aaa titles over the last few years. the thing about arma games is the longer they are out the better they get because of the community created mods. arma2 is still a great game which i still play and has a huge following. some of my favourite arma3 mods are wasteland, king of the hill, altis life and many more. you arnt really buying a game you are buying countless options and countless gaming sessions. buy it, this game is on sale often so keep an eye out.",3
"this is my most favorite game atm, updated regularly and great people to play with. recomend to anyone.",2

"this game is awesome, to put it short. this game offers a unique and good war experience, its fun to play with your friends or just by yourself. the game also offers a huge varity in gameplay, both in the games content and the players content is a very vast collection of diffrent mission and gameplays. this game has alot of diffrent mods aswell, there is apperantly breaking point (dayz) in the collection now.",2

"this is awesome. there isnt much more to it, awesome graphics, great military sandbox. 9/10",2
"this is a great game, no question about it. theres so many gamemodes around for it and a mass of mods to make the experience whatever you want it to be.",3
"this game is hard once you just play it but when you get used to it it is rlly rlly fun",1
"if you are thinking this game is going to be like cod, you better think again. this game requires you to think and plan out attacks.",1
"ridiculously realistic movement, aiming & shooting. ridiculously realistic representation of lemnos & s. stratis. its worth buying it just for the choosing of these two greek islands for a battle terrain.",1
"stratigic game, in this game you actually have to think :o unlike the  game cod",2
"amazing game, does need good computer to run, but, that not a prob for me ;d minor bugs, very funny when playing with different stances. campaign is well written and well created, i give this game 8 tacos out of 10 babes.",4
"i am going to be short and sweet on this one: i have been playing and following up with bohemia interactive products since the very first release of operation flashpoint. one warning: dont get addicted ! :)",3
"steam is bugged im not got this game but still i can write review wtf",1
"awesome game, makes a lot fun when you play the altis life or the wasteland mod of it with your friends.",1
"i have had arma iii for about a year now, and really engoy the game. the graphics, and overall gameplay is amazing and well done. i do suggest you have a higher end computer to play this game though, or play on low settings. i would suggest this game.",1
"this is the greatest game ever. great grapics and fun vehicals 11/10.",1
"this is not you usual run and gun shooter. youve been warned. be expected to die and walk. a lot.",1
"broken multiplayer + horrible singleplayer campaign = bohemia interactive. thanks guys.",1
"graphics, gameplay, and multiplayer. this game has many things that make it awesome! 10/10",3
"7/10 - an evolution from previous installments. nice graphics and solid simulation. great squad placed multiplayer over a massive 400km sandbox. lack of content hurts its score although more is being released and developed. more campaign missions coming this december. pros: nice graphics, solid shooter simulation mechanics. more accessable compared to other titles but looses none of its depth. great combined arms mp. cons: lack of content, only a partial campaign. no training missions and still plenty of bugs remains.",1
"arma 3, in my opinion, is probably the best arma in the series. not only does it boast tons of new features such as virtual aresenal, new inventory system and new, easier controls, the all around kindess community is also great. some random person took an hour to help me learn the basics. the loads of game modes add to the diversity of the game. insurgency is one of my favorites. this game has so much community content, the fun never ends. i would definetly reccomend this game!",1
"very good game once you learn it! so many gamemodes to try!",1
"game of the year! even after the release was published in 2013! 10/10~",1
"enemy ai is amazing friendly ai is terrible love it",2
"one of the best military sims evar!!! btw it seems the reason why we get fps drop in mp is becuz player character kills fps more than ai in sp?",1
"if your looking for a very demanding military shooter experience this is it. great campain so far and the modding comunity is adding fantastic things to the game.",5
"dissapointing. the game feels like its still in beta stage.",1
"so far only played the epoch mod. tried the campaign and as soon as im done with the tutorial, i recieve an error message. tried reinstalling the game and deleting the mod files. still doesnt work. but the mods make up for that so id still recommend this game but wait till its on sale, steam always has sales.",1
"my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game, ever. were on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. im leading a team of 4 men. we come to a crossroad and i sprint across, telling my men to hold back. i cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. nothing. i run, my saw gunner runs, my medic runs. but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across. anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through? remember the sniper scene? the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down. he then takes two more in the chest. the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. he screams as hes being shot. crawling, drenched in his own blood. sarge? you aint leaving me out here like this, right? i-i wanna go with you guys! cmon sarge, h-help me! cmon! please dont leave me! he died after that. i cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.",2
"hell yeah i recommend this game. this game satisfies my thirst for fps games. the most detailed game ive ever played, in terms of actual in game mechanics. if you run too much you become tired, and aiming is much more difficult. if your hit in the leg, you might not be able to walk so you must crawl. the pain from being hit effects aiming aswell. most fps are very forgiving about death, which to me has always been a huge turn off about call of duty, getting shot in the back 24/7 and having a 1.0 kd is just fine, but they are not the only ones. killzone, halo, and battlefield (on team deathmatch mode at least) are just as guilty. this game is brutal, and dying on this game is inevitable, but when you do die you realize how important following procedure and knowing how to react towards a combat situation is. one wrong step and its over. instead of hitting respawn immidiatley after i die, i find myself just stopping and saying damn, maybe if i would of retreated or gone that way, or sent my unit over there, maybe i would still be alive. and then learning from those mistakes. very rewarding and educational experience. a+",2
"one of the best pc games ive ever played . the situations you can get in are amazing and feels so rewarding when you achive something you wouldnt think you could do. a must buy in my opinion",2
"overall, the game is pretty good. i myself can say that i am somewhat pleased with it, the map is huge and very fun to explore its just with a 200 square kilometer map you would have more then just 14 air vehicles, maybe more planes and helicopter. they did mention they will be releasing new dlc for the game thank god i bought this when it was in alpha. otherwise i wouldnt be buying all that dlc. bohemia in my opinion needs to step up their game and realise there is more to please then just the general european public. :)",4
"the most realistic military games ever i have seen headcams of soilders and its closer than call of duty. the campaign is amazing but chances are that you wont play it. dont play altis life though it ruins the game. co-op is really fun. but unless you mod there are no m4s which is a bit boring which is why i still play arma 2. but over all its a really good game.",1
"one of the best shooters i played. seems like never ending fun and ofcourse the endless mod stream! 10/10",2
"yes i like the weekend thing but can u atleast let it be every wekend plz",1
"abit buggy, but extremly fun! join the funest atlis life server: 1) go to the multiplayer server search 2)remote 3) type in 74.122.192.171 and port 2302",2
"an interesting fps that is highly realistic, but still maintains a very fun feel. note: it is a fairly intesive game hardware wise, so i belive it will require a decent computer.",1
"best looking fps and a big group of differint gamemodes, mods and singleplayer/coop abilities.",1
"the most realistic shooter i have ever played. it is not optimized very well especially if you are running older hardware but if you have a decent enough computer you will never forget the experiences this game will bring you. my first day a3 i was on wasteland gametype just running around with my pistol. out of nowhere a helicopter loaded with enemies was flying directly towards me and i decided it would be a good idea to shoot at drawing attention to myself. turns out this was a good idea as the helicopter heads directly for me as if it was about to land ontop of my head, instead it takes a nosedive into the ground killing everyone inside. 10/10 would shoot down choppers again(with a pistol)",1
"arma 3 is an interesting game with all the god awful driving physics for the trucks... but hey! lets get past that one con. arma 3 in general is a frun game, but when you have friends that play it, when i first bought arma 3 i played scenarios and got bored as hell in ten seconds flat, but when you really get into it and start playing altis life and make a gang with your friends and do all that kind of stuf like my friends and i do all the drug dealing, it really hits how the fun this game is, and how pretty it is depsite the driving physics.... 8/10 realy fun game pros: gameplay altis life online multiplayer cons: physics single player",1
"best looking game of the year so far, not to mention great gameplay",1
"possible the best mil sim game out there, it is a must buy for all those hardcore military gamers. with the slight learning curve this game has definitely makes it even more fun.",2
"i would say that the best way to describe arma iii would be to say that it sends you to war. be it through having your helicopter shot down in the first five minutes of you being in the game, and ejecting just in time to avoid death, then crawling to an outpost on your broken legs, to defend it to your death, or be it in having your humvee hit by an rpg and having your commanding officers head shot off by a sniper. the game is what you make it, but i will say this. this is not a casual game by any means. if you are a fan of games like cod or bf you will not be happy with this game. the hyper realism makes it often incredibly challenging to survive, but i can say from experience that when you do succeed, you will be as excited as ever. i would reccomend most players to start out playing online, because that is where most of the fun is. the multiplayer modes and the variety of them make a nearly infinite replay value. the games sandbox nature make it a blast to play with friends, though it does lose something when playing alone. i would reccomend playing with friends. i give it a 8/10.",1
"great game : nice graphic open world fun playing with friends :d p.s i wish there are armory mode like arma 2 also hope there will be more map coming soon :d",1
"hmm, this is difficult. been enjoying this but my biggest trouble is being a ; a blind  at that i can never see where the enmies are coming from and thusly i am shredded on even the lowest difficulty by the competency of the a.i if you are good at like spotting stuff then go for it! brilliant game but i just suck at it :d",1
"this review is mostly on the vanilla version or the base game you buy. i say mostly because i recently started playing with the agm mod. anyhoo... arma 3 is a great game in my opinion. it is nothing like the general populations idea of a first person shooter (fast-pace, best connection required, twitchy shoot each other). this game actually requires you to think and try and stuff. you have to try to out think and out strategize your enemy. if i had to choose this or arma 2 oa strictly on gameplay, i would chose this hands down. now with every game there are a few things that could be changed. in the vanilla arma 3 those things are ai that can snipe using only a red dot sight, the small amount of guns, small amount of vehicles, and your friendly ai skipped the week in basic training where they learned to listen to their co. the thing about all arma games is that they are easily moddable. so all of these problems have been addressed with mods. overall i would give this game an 8/10. it is extremely fun to play coop missions with your friends along with things like wasteland and altis life. i havent played breaking point at the time of this review, the arma 2 dayz epoch mod has pretty much kept me satisfied with zombies.",2
"i have to admit i was hating this game in the beginning. i couldnt understand why i kept dying. i couldnt get the controls down and everything felt way to complicated. then a few weeks ago i decided to sit down and learn the game. as other reviewers stated this game is not call of duty or battlefield. you have to be patient. you have to learn the weapons and vehicles. this game is worth every penny as long as you invest a few days to learn the controls. add in steam workshop and other mods (breaking point is my favorite) and you have a fantastic war simulator.",1
"if you have played arma series and you liked it, you are gonna love this! 8/10",1
"very good game the graphics are overall amazing.the gameplay is very smoth for me.i always have the now and then crashes but other then that amazing game!",1
"i personaly think this is a great game becuse it has a nice engien a lot of gamemodes and mods and an active dev team. but its not perfect becuse it has some glitches and bugs here and there but otherwise good game 9/10",1
"can write review even though i dont own. good game tho 121034104014021040/10",1
"i do enjoy the arma series, mainly because of dayz and this is a great game so if you also love arma definitely play this. firstly i must say this is a huge step up from arma 2, everything looks a lot nicer and plays a lot nicer. but as with arma 2 i still find the gameplay a bit clunky, especially the movement, i know this is supposed to be on the realism side of the fps genre but its a little too realistic for my liking to the point of it loosing some of its enjoyment. everything feels so slow and again, clunky i just dont like how it plays. but again, a fantastic shooter and if you love arma or tactical fps games then yes you must buy this, wasteland and altis life are always fun.",1
"its a decent game. i hate that you have to pay so much for the dlc but other than that its worth it.",1
"this game has great bullet ballistics , best i have ever seen in any consumer pc game... only thing. this game should have linux support....",1
"great game, can be ver y frustrating at times but well worth the money. i highly suggest playing the wasteland mod in multiplayer, its a great times with freinds and enemies alike",1
"this game is absolutely beautiful. some of my best moments have been on this game, not only is the vanilla game absolutely brilliant but the modding community is also spectacular. you can play as marines, army, navy, whatever you choose. that being said, some further optomization is necessary as this game has major lag spikes and crazy fps drops, even in singleplayer. i have played for 300 hours and have yet to play the campaign, its great. if you are wondering what this game requires graphics card wise, i am playing with a msi radeon r9 270x which is a mid range card, on all ultra at average of 50-60 fps (on singleplayer). for a long time i was playing with a nvidia geforce 610 which is a low end card but wsa still able to play and had great expierences with. so overall, no matter what your specs are, buy this game. if your specs arent quite good enough to run it on ultra or high the sheer gameplay expierences will make you want to invest mor time, and of course more money on pc games. gameplay 10/10 graphics 9/10 fps 7/10 storyline (from what ive seen from others and from the few missions i have dabbled in) 9/10 overall 9/10 would play",5
"i was introduced to arma through the dayz mod for arma 2. it says a lot when a game is so moddable that it spawns other games... ive bought arma 3 during the alpha. best money ive ever spent. find a good clan/group/community and youll have a hard time running out of things to do with this game. cherry on top? the devs are mad men. they hammer daily on the dev branch and release monster patch notes every months. the game has a few flaws like the scroll menu that makes me sometimes lose my  when i try to open a door and instead change weapon. ladders. oh dear god ladders. if you want a good fps with awesome vehicles. arma 3 is for you. and when you think youre done... go look at the mods...",2
"this game is amazing. i recommend this to anyone who likes realism military simulations and enjoys actual simulation events.",2
"the best game i have ever played. sadly a lot of people will never get to try how amazing arma 3 and roleplaying on altis life servers is. its so different from other games and i love it.",3
"great game to start with it has a pretty good community which i value deerly. the game is pretty realistic, this can be a pain if you get shot and you dont even have a clue were it came from. although its a very good games its a bit of a bummer that the campaign is released in parts, but atleast the developers care enought to not rush the release, this would be worse. overall a good game although its pretty heavy for most systems.",2
"arma 3 + 0 mods = good game arma 3 + steam workshop mods = better arma 3 + armaholic mods = the best 12/10, must buy. best game ever buyyyyy it",2
"cool just a bit laggy as my pc is full of crap! but it needs some work and fixing!",1
"the game is great, its very glitchy and needs to fix bugs but overall is one of my favorite games.",2
"when are you fix the game for cpu 2,3,4,6,8 cores haven, if you think that all people have pentium 4 with nitrogen and 8000 ghz overlock are you crazy! whay the game are havent status alpha, and what a price 60$???!",4
"this game... is 10/10, its super fun and their is so much to do, epoch, breaking point, arma 3 life, altis life, anything you want. and then not to mention but all the workshop stuff you can do. it is without a doubt worth $60",3
"arma 3 is a side-scrolling 2d platformer developed by ea. in the games main mode (competitve), you play as one of two factions; the terrorists, crazed madmen who seek to destroy the world by unleashing ravenous chickens infected with the ebola virus, and the counter terrorists, who desire to stop the fowl plague. armed with $800 and their wits, players seek out the various chicken sites and fight over control of the worlds destiny.",1
"guy i need help with one thing i am new 2 arma, i want to play altis life how do i get????",1
"this game crashes constantly. i have yet to play a full multiplayer match because it freezes within 10 minutes of playing every time. i have a high spec computer and play other games on highest settings. when i try to play arma 3 on lowest settings, it crashes. this game is what we call a complete failure. save your money for a game that actually works.",1
"if you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. if you dont have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. if you dont have the game to play, get the money for it. if you dont have the money for it, get a job. if you dont have a job, rob the bank. if you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.",1
"excellent. king of the hil with 3 teams fighting for one obj. coop for when you dont want to kill eachother and want to stalk the enemy down with a rifle, rocket, grenade launcher, tank, heli, apache, f18, or a45 frogfoot. vehicles control like a simulator. hours of entertainment. working as a team and assualting entire cities is an unforgettable experience.",1
"everything you wanted a combat based shooter-sim to be. fly a helicopter and do strafing runs? sure. lead your squad to do breaching parties? why the hell not? scuba dive with friends and clear our enemy positions? very fun. this is probably the best shooter i have played. and i am looking forward to the full development of it. arma 3, you have my respect also, iits visually stunning, and its either 3rd person and 1st. 10/10",1
"great game, its very fun but it would be best to play with a mic (multiplayer). they also have some great mods",3
"this game is fun to play with friends on a server or download the communitys games and try them out. loads of different modes online you can play. but i recommend playing with friends its way more fun to screw around that way",1
"waste of freaking money. the game runs like crap, the aiming freaking sucks and theres freaking invisible enemies that can kill you even though yoju cant see them. worst game ever i regret buying this piece of crap!",1
"this game is a really fun game. it could use improvements like a better modding community but other than that everything about it is great. it takes a toll on your computer if you dont have a good one, but still i heavily recommend it.",2
"its good, but i think they could remove more of the bugs",1
"this game is mostly bought for its mods, which isnt a bad thing. it has a lot of mods to choose from and theyre all good in their own way.",2
"great game id pay $100 for this! its a must buy if you like real life type shooters.",3
"this game is one of the most cpu demanding games ive ever played. yeah it has good gameplay and graphics, but they optimised it awfuly. and because of that the fps is bad and so is lag. if they would fix that i would give it around a 8/10. but for now its about a 4/10. i have a gtx 760 and amd 6300 six core processor with 3.50 ghz and 8 gigs of ram. so its not my pc.",1
"arma 3 is a great game but isnt as good as arma 2 (in my opinon) this game has lots of bugs and glitches. arma 3 looks good but it needs a great pc to run smoothly. sa-matras wasteland is amazing and id recommend it",1
"best military third/fps game ever,,,, ground breaking graphics makes war even real ,, tactics and planning every step you take is awesome ,,, great war atmosphere ,, unlike cod/battlefield you have to be aware in every step you take cuz you can be shot 400 miter away . best simulation game ever. xd",1
"if you played the cod series and wanna jump into this i dont think its for you, however if you like war simulators, bullet drops, tactics and realism i do indeed recomend it. enjoy!",5
"still needs a bit of work, but overall ive had plenty of fun.",1
"bumped my tank into a rock my tank flew 50 ft 2 back flips later it stuck a perfect landing. would drive that tank agian",1
"it was fun at first, but it grew old quickly. i purchased due to atlis life mod, and quickly found the lack of players willing to comply with server rules, made the game not so enjoyable. the large maps are nice and all, but too damn big for 100 or less people... i enjoy the realist consideration of the game, such as fatigue from sprinting, and its effect on aiming. overall, arma 3 does not have a lasting effect on me. some of the situations that occur are very fun, and memorable, but i often find myself logged in, running around in circles doing nothing. for large scale combat (meaning hundreds of players at the same time, in the same location), on maps the size of arma 3 maps, i would recommend planetside 2, which is a free-to-play game. the simulation arma 3 offers is extremely impressive, and quenches my thirst of rendering 360 no-scope headshot noobs useless. however, as a game, i dont enjoy it as much.",1
"lol i dont even own it wtf y can i do this 10/10 would recommend to other pants. edit: why do i have one hour lol",1
"the one game that will make you realize are you sure you wanna go join the army! just hear these great reviews i cant believe i have to walk 1 km! - fakezone i forgot to sleep! - old fat guy hey this game is so great its my name jumbled up! - amar",1
"best war-sim ever. great fun when u have a squad going :)",1
"better than arma 2 , war simulator co-op awesomeness with explosives",2
"the game is apsolutly awesome grapich,world.its bugged in 30 min gameplay once.second best arma game",1
"for beta neckbeards too fat to join the real army. 10/10",2
"has great graphics and extremely realistic. very good for someone who wants to feel like theyre really there",1
"this game isnt that bad, it lacks quantity of weapons and vehicles though. i would have to say in the long run, arma 2 and arma 2 oa are better in terms of quality and quantity.",4
"altis life, breaking point maaahhhh 10/10 coop 10/10",1
"arma 3 is by far one of the best or even the best game i have played in my entire life. not only is the engine fantastic but the graphics are out of this world. the campaign was written in the most euphoric way possible and the amount of fun to be had on multiplayer is endless. also the mods which are out for arma 3 are great compared to other games. my favourite aspect about arma 3 is how it is so diverse that every type of gamer will find something they love. 6 stars!",2
"im not into the futuristic crap they brought into this franchise. luckily the arma community have some awesome mods - check out armaholic",3
"this is a great war simulator which suports realisim with real time 1st or 3rd person stratagy. go it alone our with a squad of ais or players and i general great game",4
"i like this game. i played my first fps years ago starting with doom and at that time i was blown away, and could never of dreamed of anything better. boy was i wrong. the next game to capture my imagination was meadal of honour and the single player world captured my imagination and heart. with meadal of honour came the first real multiplayer action that i enjoyed and i couldnt stop playing. next game to follow was call of duty, a great series of games that offered plenty of run and gun action... great stuff. the progression to battlefield for a more indepth experience blew what came before away. now battlefield looked to offer with its later installments a more realistic battle experience, but it fails. infantry are fine but the vehicles,which look great,in my opinion start to ruin the game series. that brings me to arma 3,, wow ,, once again i am blown away and once again what came before falls into history. animations, lighting, movment and the environment are a dream come true. this is a truely epic game.",1
"in all honesty, if youre not planning on modding this game, dont get it. youll have fun with the vanilla version for a little while then youll get so bored. if you plan on getting it, mod the  out of it. trust me with my like 500 hours of my life gone thanks to this game, im pretty sure like 400 of those hours were by using mods. oh and you need a really good computer to run this and even then its still pretty laggy. for nvidia users get it optimized it works best that way",4
"has a few missing things here and there but can entertain a man for hours. kinda like your mom. 8/10.",2
"i love this game and if you want the intenceness of a real battle but dont want to die , heres your solution",1
"excellent graphics and fantastic team play. if you want a game that is realistic and fast paced then this is the one for you. there are also chances to go solo in several multiplayer servers if thats your style!",3
"an unbelievable step forward in nearly every respect within an already great series. graphically sublime with most improvements focusing on animation and gameplay fluidity. steam workshop has made the world of modding and mission making bigger and more accessible than ever before. games really awesome so far.",3
"build a good computer, buy this and get addicted! 9/10",1
"if you come into arma with a battlefield or call of duty-mindset, you will die, you will find it to be something you wont like, and youll find yourself frustrated to pieces and back. this is not an fps, this is a military simulation. you have been warned. you will need to spend a lot of time in the game, getting a grasp of tactics and how to best employ yourself, your weapons, your squad and your support-options, before its truly enjoyable. this is also one of those games that are far better in multiplayer than in singleplayer. id actually go so far as to say that playing arma 3 for its singleplayer wont even begin to give you an idea of what arma really is, and that you should try out the mp once youve gotten a general grasp of things. the arma-series are not games you hop into casually. they are also games that needs to be extensively modded in order to become truly great, but luckily theres a thriving mod-community thats very active. on the downside: arma 3 is brutal when it comes to its demands of your hardware. you will need to tweak and fine-tune your ingame graphics-options in order to get the best playability out of the game. putting everything on max will put most if not all but the absolute highest-end computers into a high-stress environment.",1
"nice looking game when it works....crashes oftern.",1
"i have played call of duty and battlefield games . arma 3 just did not grab my attention . the gameplay sucked , the story sucked. now i am sure there is a lot of people who love the series and i am happy for them . arma is not worth the price they are asking . if you must have this game ,wait till it comes on sale dirt cheap !",1
"highly recommended! as no big fan of any fps genre, i found this release impressively beautiful, complex, and truly a representation of military simulation game were long to. my fascination to the series began when bi, together with cm in the old days released operation flashpoint, then the next release such as cold war crisis, the first armed assault up til the third installment. gamers with high preference of immersion and reality would actually addicted to this beta-state game; which will be developed more as the community demands more realistic, more challenging battleground. i recommend you buy it now, before its development completes and eventually released in full-version. cheers :)",1
"arma 3 is so much more than you expect. the amount of free content for this game is staggering.",1
"i downloaded it on a steam weekend and now it says purchase",1
"the game is awesome, it has some very good servers like wasteland and altis life. also breaking point mod is very good, but you need to download it separately. weapons and vehicles are very nice to play with. however you need very.. very awesome gaming pc to run it on highest settings and if you can play 100 player altis life server on ultra settings with 60+ fps, thats quite an achievement, i mean damn. warning, dont buy this game if you plan to play it on a laptop or a computer that can barely run other big games. +very playable and good looking even with lowest settings +awesome servers and mods +sea, air, and land modern combat -sometimes it runs like a potato if you dont have expensive computer",3
"this game is very buggy, i have an average graphics card that can run most of the games out there but with this game, you need like a $9000 computer to even run it. the maps are way too huge for your graphics to run smoothly, i had to turn everything down and even still i was lagging like crazy. i would highly recommend playing the battlefield series instead of this game because a. you will get more enjoyment and entertainment from battlefield b. your computer will be able to run it c. better vehicle system and lots of weapons to choose from",1
"great game. graphics are amazing! you will spend days in this game.",1
"best game to enjoy tactical yet hard core gameplay in multiplayer",2
"the most realistic shooter i have ever played. it is not optimized very well especially if you are running older hardware but if you have a decent enough computer you will never forget the experiences this game will bring you. my first day a3 i was on wasteland gametype just running around with my pistol. out of nowhere a helicopter loaded with enemies was flying directly towards me and i decided it would be a good idea to shoot at drawing attention to myself. turns out this was a good idea as the helicopter heads directly for me as if it was about to land ontop of my head, instead it takes a nosedive into the ground killing everyone inside. 10/10 would shoot down choppers again(with a pistol)",1
"when you buy arma 3, you need to join a unit. being in a unit is the most fun i have had in a game in a long time. this game is about multiplayer, and it is is so much more fun when you play it with other people.",1
"best game i have ever played and highley recommend this game",1
"i played alot of arma 2 and as with arma 3 it is pretty similar. the campaign is pretty boring and im sure like most people who will buy this game you will just not play it. but the hours of joy will come when you discover the sheer amount of great multiplayer servers avaliable to you. just like dayz the different game type are practically whole game themselves and i personally have spent all my hours playing them. 8/10 - your buying multiple games in one",2
"such a good game, recomended to anyone into shooting games",1
"its just the best shooter ive ever played the graphics are awesome the game play is realistic as a fps could ever be it is the pub stomber of bf4 n cod what ever number or  name there up too",1
"although it may still only be in a disguised beta sort of stage,its still immensly fun when you hop onto a multiplayer server (try invade and annex which is what im referencing here) hop into a formed up squad and clear aos with the help of coordinated allies. zeus is also incredibly fun if youre into dropping people into s**t storms. the ability to basically create your own batles is a very fun concept indeed. workshop intergration allows mission creators publish their stuff easier and more people have more acess to it. if you want to buy it or not, i dont mind but you definetly keep your eyes on arma if incase something makes you just suddenly get the urge to buy it (like many, many mods) and i hope to see you on the field.",4
"great game. would be great with more weapons and a useable bipod. controller support is great; just a few button maps dont seem to work. awesome game overall. 9/10 would eat.",2
"the game is really great for simulation in warfare, a must buy!",1
"best fps ever, especially with the inclusion of the zeus mod. thanks to zeus, every multiplayer session i get into with my friends is so unique, challenging, and full of new content it actually feels more like fresh dlc than just another night of multiplayer.",2
"amazing game! very fun and tactically impressive. best tactical shooter there is to date!",1
"a very very good dude shooter with things that only can happen in arma. 11/10 its kind of the bomb.",3
"ive been waiting for a game like this my whole life without even knowning it. quite possibly the best shooting game ever made.",1
"my initial review said that arma 3 would be a great game by late 2014 when more mods and content were released. i am glad to say that this became true several months before i expected. between the incredible zeus game mode (an on-the-fly mission creator) and excellent mods like advanced gameplay mod, task force radio and alive this is one of the best co-op games available. you will need at least 4-5 people to really have fun in multiplayer, but theres really no other game that offers what arma does.",2
"its lots of money for shure but graphics are up to date and sound so yeah i recommend :d",1
"there is a learning curve if you are looking to play it seriously, becoming good at this game requires dedication and time but there are usually casual servers to have easy fun on if you are looking to mess around",1
"arma 3 is a highly adictive game. there are tons of thing to do.i have only played 144 hours and still havent seen the whole experiance. multiplayer, amazing. singleplayer, amazing. you would have to do somehing quite spectacular to ruin your experiance with this game.",1
"the best game i have ever played. sadly a lot of people will never get to try how amazing arma 3 and roleplaying on altis life servers is. its so different from other games and i love it.",3
"i liked very much arma / arma 2 and now i am getting this one !",1
"i would reccomend it its a brilliant game, not alot of bugs that i could see and the mods and dlcs that come with it are boss",1
"dont know why steam did not record all of my arma 2 hours which was over 200 spent on it but arma 3 lives up to its expectations! i have been playing it since alpha and even in alpha it was so much fun, the mods are amazing cough* breaking point *cough and you can play as zeus! lightning bolts for all!",1
"this game crashes alot. sometimes i can play for hours without crashes, sometimes for 30 min, sometimes 20 etc etc. very frustrating. i bought this game 50% off during the christmas sale, i cannot recommend anyone to buy this game when its being sold for 44,99 euro. im sorry. its a fun game but crashes alot.. :(",1
"arma 3 is arguably the single most realistic and immersive experience you can find today. it took me quite a while to get it running well, however after its up and running you wont be able to put it down. the maps are insanely huge, allowing for intense tactics. the realism of the guns is where this game really shines. while some may complain that the kick is not entirely realistic you have to adjust the sights for distance. if you get shot even once you will either be dead or have an injury such as a broken leg which only allows you to walk. overall this game is a 9.5/10. aside from some performance issues this game is nothing short of amazing",1
"i bouth this game in alpha for 20 euro, now its for 45 euro. enjoy",1
"if you are prepared to play on 30 fps with poor overall performance on high end pc (it doesnt matter at all) with desync issues ... although it has very big potential gameplay wise.",2
"now this game is a complicated one to review. on its own its nothing really (and definately not worth 35.00) but with all of the mods made by the community, arma 3 has definately saved. the mods that i would personally recommend you get for this game are: arma 3: breaking point, arma 3 battle royal and arma 3: life mod.",1
"relatively realistic mil-sim. this iteration is geared more towards gamers than simmers, but its still great fun! note: if you have terrible fps/lag while in a server, make sure you are running the same mods as the server or your game will constantly be running into errors in attempt to locate the same mod files (or so ive gathered). i can run at 30fps at max settings in sp but when i join a server without the same mods i drop to 8fps. dont blame your system or the game!",2
"10/10, most engaging tactical shooter ive played in a long time.",2
"this game is plain amazing. it will give you countless hours of gameplay hours to play with your friends or even by yourself. there is workshop support/many mods that add new scenarios everyday. the developers are also constantly working on this and they come out with a major update about every month that adds even more hours. there is a singleplayer campaign that will probably last around ten hours(im not sure about this) with a great story that helps you get to understand the game in more depth. the multiplayer has tons of servers and tons of players with a bunch of different amazing modes. 10/10 superb game that will last you forever.",1
"playing wasteland in arma 3 is alot crazier the it was in arma 2",1
"i got killed by a car park barrier closing on my car while driving under it. beat that for authenticity.",2
"arma 3 is a top game, i highly recommend this to anyone who likes tactical fpss. the graphics, and gameplay are awesome, plus theres a whole lot more, like the editor where the only limitations is your imagination. play in other peoples creations what they have published on steam workshop. play through the newly added campaigns in single player. multiplay, coop, single play is up to you.",1
"one of a kind military simulation that happens to contain 1st person shooting occasionally. known for its massive scale, unfairness, community produced content, impossible system requirements, steep learning curve and bugs. you will be doing plenty of following: 1) waiting 2) running in the countryside 3) crossing your fingers you see the enemy before the enemy sees you 4) dying in various, sudden and unexpected violent events caused by bullets, explosives, rpgs, crashing helicopters or falling from tall structures 5) laughing at bizarre glitches in the end you either adore arma 3 and play for years to come or uninstall it faster than a speeding bullet.",1
"this is the most realistic war game in existence at the moment. do not buy this game if you enjoy call of duty or other similar shooting galleries. this game is hardcore with its precise controls, realistic damage model, and complicated battles. the singleplayer campaign is something to be marveled. it blends realistic war with an intriguing story. this game is for those who want more from the everyday shooter. you must be dedicated if you want to play this game. i will easily reccomend this game but only if you know what you are getting into.",1
"arma 3 is a really good game. if you love arma 2 strategic and realistic fpses, this is the game for you. but if you dont like strategic , and you rather play cod than arma 2, etc. you rather not buy this game. you like it, or not. arma 3 is really fun if you play multiplayer with your friends, or make a tunngle lan match and play co-op missions or sandbox. some buildings will break if you explode them with an rpg, like the tower in the stratis air base, try it for yourself if you have it!",2
"its hard to recommend this game. seeing how they are trying to make a combat sim type of game its not exactly action packed. you spend most of your time equipping yourself, and trying to get to whatever objective your going for. then once you get somewhere you might finally get into some action. now this whole process can be more fun if your in a group & communicating and having laughs along the way. the first few days i played i probably spent about 4 hours getting around and finding stuff and maybe only got into a few gun fights. it takes a special kind of person to really love this kind of game. for me it was more of a novelty. there is one game mode where you need to hold an objecitve, this was more action packed by getting everyone in one area which led to less travel time and more time running around and trying to hunt targets down. once this game can create some modes that streamlines action into the sim portion of it would make the game alot better. all in all the game is amazing, and done well once you get past learning how to do it. you can have a great time with it if you accept how much time your going to spend just trying to get somewhere.",1
"if you want a ture shooter look no further this is by far the best army/simulator game ive played",1
"like its predecessor, arma 3 really raises the bar in the gaming industry. graphics, beautiful... physics, fluid... gameplay... enagaging... you wont find a shooter like it! the number of mods is growing rapidly, and thats what really makes the arma series what they are today. as with arma 2, you are purchasing a game, with many separate games embedded for mulitplayer, or singleplayer. due to the fact that this game is full release, there are no major issues, and its only recently been available! however i would recommend waiting for a sale or buying this game elsewhere, as i do think 40 is a little steep, atleast for me.",1
"on my opinion this is the best wwiii simulator :) cant wait to get that full game!",4
"i usually love arma but when it crashes (happens 24 hours a day) i get so ing pissed off! and my arma just decided to think im new and it did not save my changes i did to infi. movment and ext....",2
"arma 3 is a fantastic game and a great followup to arma 2. the game looks amazing, the animations are fluid, and the combat is exhilarating. oh and i saw people complaining about crashing and i can say that out of my 120 hours of gameplay i have crashed once and that was because of unstable mods. i dont even have a beast of a computer and i dont run into any problems. yes there is not as much content as arma 2 but that has to do with the fact that arma 2 had like 10 dlcs. overall its a great game to play whether alone or with friends and i totally recommend it to anyone.",2
"oh god yes <3 this game needs more units tho... but it keeps getting better and better so dont worry :p",1
"this is the best game ever! there is so much to do cant go wrong with this buy.",4
"this game was probably the best 60 bucks i have ever invested",4
"the greatest military sim, game and all of the above ever made. keep up the good work guys and gals @ bohemia.",2
"arma 3 is, by far, the best millitary simulator ive ever seen. only for those who like hardcore millitary simulators.",1
"arma 3 i think incorparates some of the best shooting mechanics ive seen in military sim, how ever the mechanics overall can become quite clunky. you need a fairly beefy pc to make it look playable. it was gifted to me and i actually enjoy but i dont know if id invest to heavily into it. its as close you want to get to combat and for that i give it a thumbs up.",1
"the game is so realistic that i have contracted ptsd.",1
"amazing game got a learning curve to eat not your typical shooter witch just keeps you engadeg very good game well worth the money",1
"all my hours are on altislife and this game is so fun. you need to buy it",4
"best game eu..! or it would have been if only they implemented the weapons of modern war, instead of weapons of a war 50 years ahead.. i mean 6.5 caliber rifles? i use that for hunting moose.. but nothing to cry about when there is mods.. alot of mods including modern weapons like hk416, m4, scar and so on.. with every possible attachment u can think of.. i highly recomend this game with mods.. and for multiplayer experince i recomend ahoy world eu#3 modded server.. its just a blast.. :d",4
"a game that only exists because of a mod that hardly works for a game that also hardly works, this game also hardly works. overloads most routers",1
"i bought it on sale. its a little cluncky, but i am actually rather enjoying some of the custom missions and mods. so buy it for the mods, rather than the campaign and youre all good",2
"arma 3 is as real as it gets in military simulation. i would rank the 3 main military simulator games like this; cod < battlefield < arma. i have played the arma series since arma 2 and i can say that this game requires more use of strategy and skill rather than the other two games listed above. it is not about shoot em up, get points, and level up. it is more like use your advantages and strategy against the enemy to push back or eliminate them. its about teamwork and large amounts of skill to win the mission. there are 2 huge islands in the game with tons of bases and towns on each. there are lots of mods and the multiplayer is fun when you find a good lobby. (i mostly play battle royale and annex). the single player is fun and long and the graphics are amazing if you have a good pc to run them. there are not as many vehicles in this than arma 2, but there are still a lot. the workshop makes getting add-ons a breeze. if i were to give a rating for this game i would give it a 9/10, with the -1 being around half the multiplayer lobbies having near empty or no people in them most of the time. other than that this game is a great buy for people looking for hardcore military simulators.",1
"drives over guy with a heavy armed vehicle-dies. tries it again-wheel gets destroyed-vehicle explodes-dies. 10/10",1
"if you are looking for a ground combat simulation, then this is definitely for you. the game features a vast range of weapons and equipment. it also come with a powerful editor, allows you to create your own missions and scenarios.",1
"damned fantastic game, like the rest of the series. hostile takeover tdm servers are good play particularily.",1
"great game. i definately dont play it enough but i should!",1
"what a dissapointment. massive step back from arma 2 and the campaign is made in the basic mission editor, i can make better missions myself. embarrasing.",1
"awesome game janky as  but real good fun especially altis life and king of the hill ,if you want a shooter more serious than cod or bf which takes actual skill this is the one for you.",1
"very good made looks very nice with ultra settings, got so many gamodes aswell!",2
"this is by far the bast arma game i have play what next for arma who know but i recommend this to all my friend",2
"amazing 3rd or 1st person shooter that has a very realistic feel (aka simulator) hard to get bored with all the user created content and the editor. the controls can be a tad tough to learn at first but with in a few hours you should have them down. being able to mod your game file gives you tons of customizable things to do. i would recomend playing with a group of people because playing this game by yourself can tend to get boring. that is the only flaw iv been able to find really aside from a few random bugs here and there.",5
"best game!!!! its got a lot fo improvement in it that than arma 2. but the main problem happens when u need to play battle royal the servers are always locked.",1
"this game is realistic as ever. its bright, eventful, and overall addicting to the point where im playing it for hours and dont even notice it. i love playing sandbox cause you can build bases and move stuff around. also the fact that you can choose to attack people or help people is diffently a plus. you also play with most of the equipment to get the hang of all of the vehicles and weapons. the only downside is there are quite a few bugs but what game doesnt they are not too bad but sometimes can be aggravating.",1
"this game is great. not only does it have a great campaign and editor, it offers multiplayer. it is 10x better playing online with friends. and if you ever do get bored with the vanilla game there are mods. a lot of them too. you can also download so many different mods. there are downloads for missions, guns, cars, and a whole lot more. there are also different game modes and scenarios that change how you play the game. this is by far one of my favorite games. so i truly do recommend this game!",2
"great game even though it still has some issues on altis but i definetly recommend it, its worth every penny",1
"one of the best military sims ever created. amazing true-to-life graphics and a real sense of peril -coupled with one of the largest modding communities of any game means this will never get old. i must buy for any military shooter/sim.",1
"really im not sure how i feel about this game. when its fun its a blast.... when its not fun youre wandering across the countryside alone with nothing to do. like other similar games things can go from notmalto chaotic in seconds and some great things happen. in those moments this game really shines. other times its boring as hell.",1
"long time fan of the arma series... arma 3 is fast approaching my favourite in the series, really looking forward to the changes they are making in the future.",2
"extremely fun game if you look for a troop to operate with. if you dont then its pretty much a waste of money. its a military simlulator, so it requires communication and a certain trust that no ones gonna shoot a rocket in the middle of the spawn base.",1
"arma iii altis first experiance. -joined a session. -figured out how to spawn in. -spawned in. -walked around for aproximatly 17 seconds. -car came. -car went. -walked around for a further 12 seconds. -another car came! -three guys stepped out. -fully geared. -i was their . -i got into the car. -cried. -cried a little more. -thought about my life a little bit. -pressed space bar twice. -died. gg m8 i r8 8/8",1
"i can really recommend this game, its just awesome for so many reasons !! :d",1
"absolute ing  of a game. bi can suck my  for their dlc policy. they release a game that isnt even 50% finished and then without even coming close to finishing the game, they release dlcs that spam you in game. its absolutely ridiculous that i am a paying customer and im bombarded with ads for their dlc while im playing the game i already paid for...  you bi i will never buy any of your -not-finished-games ever again.",1
"arma 3 is a fun game to play with friends if you dont have anyone to play with its not gunna be that fun but its a great game but only one thing i dont get why did they have to make the controlles so weird i mean why but besides that its a great game",1
"your soldier starts panting uncontrollably after 2 minutes of jogging. apparantly soldiers dont have physical training anymore in 2035. 10/10",3
"fun as everything run nicely and the workshop items are pretty dam good",1
"i really enjoy all the different gamemodes and it also looks incredible. if you dont have a super computer though, dont buy. very unoptimized even with a good computer.",1
"10/10 - best game ever! this is my favorite game. you might think arma 2 and arma 3 are the same thing, but there not. i have played arma 2 for a long time but you might say oh you dont have it on steam. well thats right i dont i played it on something else. so i really recommend this game. so stop reading this and wasting your time and play this game!",1
"no other game is like arma. nothing will ever be like arma. you need this game.",4
"this price is outragous, i cant speand this kind of cash. sure this game is great but still, i want it but for like 20$ pliz.",2
"the best military sim game. the solo campaign is a bit different this time, with episodes. the first one is very good and shows us many new features. the editor, which can be complex or very intuitive, depending on what you want to do, promisses endless possibilites for the future. the ai was reworked, the gameplay is more or less the same as arma2, the graphic engine is wonderful if you have the machine to take it!",1
"nice game never got the chance to play arma 3 life tho",1
"better than arma 2. recommended. downloaded breaking point...stopped playing dayz.",2
"one of the best military sims out there. if you like immersion/sandbox, then you will love this.",3
"the leader in military simulator third installment arma 3 arma 3 has so much content that you will keep coming back. with a dynamic campaign that is influenced by the players actions and a user friendly editor for custom single player co-op and multiplier missions. armaholic supplies the player with one of the biggest modding communities and content that is almost endless.",5
"what the  why did they change up the controls from arma 2 i keep trying to double tap w to run or press shift to walk  you ers ing  i dont remember how to fly helicopters anymore help",1
"this game is  over uses the cpu and ing crashes all the time dont ing buy this so much money for a not fun hogging cpu piece of !!",1
"any sane person would say this game is bad... i am not sane. this has got to be the most fun ive had with a game in a long time.",1
"this is an absolust beast of an game. recommend it to everyone! stunning graphics and many hours of brutal gaming. 10/10",1
"its a great army game love rideing the tanks and driving helis i say its army simulator in a way.",1
"i am a massive fan of all arma games and i can say after a dodgy release bohemia interactive have eventually have brought this game to close perfection and with visuals like this, i am hooked. if you are new to arma i recommend starting here, it gives you clear instructions and a smooth campaign (thats if you can run it). it has nice, mature, loyal and welcoming community (with the occasional your mum joke) that does not hesitate to mod and create user made missions, so boredom is rare. i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a deeper fps experience.",2
"amazing game. so many different game modes that you can do such as altis life, wasteland and king of the hill. wasteland is by far my favourite build structures and find weapons, its basically day z without zombies. breaking point is also good for arma 3 its very fun however does need a lot of work to meet the standards of breaking point in arma 2 10/10",3
"a lot of the greatest butt-clenching moments ive had in gaming have been in arma. i am in no way a veteran to the series, but ive learned a lot since i was introduced to arma 2 durring the early dayz days. since then ive come to love and appreiciate the core game and its community for everything they have to offer. arma 3 may not be sitting on as much content as arma 2 in its current state, but its well on its way. not only is the community hard at work, bohemia continues to impress with improvements and new features. almost everything (rip steering cursor) is an improvement over arma 2, and im exited to see what other goodies the future brings.",2
"this game might not be for asian players. reason? they arent many servers for asian players. the game has been known for their dayz mod and altis life. i cant play altis life the reason i got the game cause i get kicked due to the latency issue. server location.",1
"very fun game. multiplayer is awesome and the number of workshop add ons is substantial.",1
"although the reliability of certain game mechanics and functionality is far from optimal, youre forced to cater to the games faults, making it that much more gratifying to master. modded servers are unreliable, at best, when servers are filled to the brim. accidentally falling from a 2 1/2 step will kill you. sometimes you get stuck in objects like walls and floors. sometimes, items disappear from your inventory and occasionally your inventory just isnt there, its gone. sometimes, sometimes a bunch of assclowns ddos the modded servers to frustrate the people playing. sometimes.....sometimes arma sucks hard, really hard. its bad enough to where, at times, it turns you off to gaming in general and makes you rethink your hobbies. sometimes it makes you regret building a computer just to handle its heavy processing load and having your heart torn out when it takes 48mins to join your favorite server, for it to never happen. but then, i remember, arma is intensely intricate. things can be done and scenarios can be played out, only on arma. this is a big boys game, taking patience and intelligence. you buy this, i guarantee that you will hate life 40% of the time you play it. you dont buy this, youll regret it for the rest of your life. 10/10 *ps: dat altis life doe",4
"this is f***ing awesome *-* although it has many bugs yet ...",2
"improved handling, realistic to a point, military shooter wows me in its gameplay! also, strong and weak side urban prone.",1
"is a super coll game i played this for the weekend and what can i say i will probably buy this game very very soon :)",1
"this is a super realistic millitary based game. i mean whats not to love?",1
"tried the free weekend trail and i had a blast. the controls were hard to learn at first bit soon it grows on you. i recommend buying this game.",1
"this is the best game ever made for pc. it servers as a base for the 52 mods i use",4
"warning, stay away at all costs!!! it is a piece of bs game that will give you 20 frames in multiplayer on your high end computer with all low settings. it has been out for more than a year and the game still runns like crap. take a look at all the improve fps guides and articles on the internet and you will see that the game is poorly optimized junk. or how about them my 5000usd computer gives me 20-30fps in multiplayer articles and videos? the game utilizes about 40% of my cpu and gpu and gives crappy frame rates (singleplayer works fine, this is just concerning multiplayer). the game is junk and from what i read on the internet it will stay that way, people say that arma 2 had the same issues and they never got fixed.",1
"this is a great step up from arma 2. they did take an odd turn and remove most weapons from the base game to get people to buy additional dlc. beyond that, the new graphics introduced is a nice update to the game that introduces working screens and a cleaner look. the arma physics for vehicles that used to be a riot when in a wheeled vehicle has been largely updated and has less vehicles flying 200 ft. into the air. all in all, a great game to play with friends or even random people to get your tactics on.",2
"this game is probably the least fun game ive played in a long time. it tries to sell itself as a military sim, but its as much a military sim as minecraft. wandering an empty island for hours until you get shot by some guy six miles away is not fun. also, 60 dollar price tag? games like red orchestra 2 are so much better than this and are much cheaper. youre money is better spent elsewhere.",1
"best played with friends, enjoyable solo play as well.",1
"i dont even own this game but i can write a review so ive got that going for me.",1
"this game is excellent! so much better the arma 2 and oa gameplay wise. 11/10",1
"best game in my mind. started playing arma 2 back when it came out and the amount of mods you can get for both is amazing but this game takes it a bit further. i can spend hours playing dress up and making meth in my underwear, nothing else compares. and if you want to play with milsim groups there are plenty out there. you can go diving with the female mod so you can have your babe with you, go sky diving then watch the sunset together. 11/10 will try to hit on that chick again.",4
"this game is so much better than 2 i would recommend this to many people.",1
"f**king amazing so much fun lots of diffrent modes and things to do",5
"this game is just awesome. it is a big jump from arma 2.",1
"this is the game! if you had military training, you play milsim games such as airsoft or paintball, you are a fun of modern warfare, you want to experience a real life combat situation this is the game... arma 3 gives you unique experience, adrenaline rush a bit of frustration and great satisfaction with the completion of the given task. if you have military training you will find that it gives you an actual advantage in this game! bullets will pin you down and they will determine your next moves. its a total military simulation i totally recommend this game to players that are not fun of arcade like fps or consider battlefield (which is a great game) realistic.",1
"awesome game! love the graphics and how many things you can do in this game",4
"this compact model sedan has great interior crocodile aligator leather seats and nice city mpg. beats the subway by a long shot 2/10",1

"scouted the map as a seagull. 10/10, would scout again.",3
"a very thrilling, action packed military simulator. this is definatly an improvment over the past games, highly recomended.",2
"if you like games that are to hard and are not enjoyable to any extent go head waste your 60 bucks on this game... game is extremely laggy, horrible hardware optimization and online play is a joke... if your look to get anywhere close to 60 fps max settings you better have a top dollar machine. story mode is ok, if you like getting shot at, and never knowing if you hit the enemy or not ....",1
"i takes the origanl aspects of the other games in the series and make it ten time better worth buying",1
"absolutely amazing game, never had as much adrenaline in my life! when you are in combat, it feels like you are in deep  in real life... dont masturbate after infantry combat, your hands shake and it is not physically possible, but hey...give it a try",2
"biggest issue: aiming was messed up with an update which actually promotes camping as taking shots makes you really unaccurate. graphics: very realistic and nice. textures are hit and miss but ragdolls are awful. desync and hitdection kill the multiplayer. performance is awful with any hardware due to unoptimised engine. story is generic. ai are either god like or brain dead. overally lacks a lot of features and fixes but had a lot of potenital.",1

"you should get this game its awesome and realistic",1
"arma 3 is obviously a better arma 2, in many ways. many positives to the game. one of which is the addition of the steam workshop. to download missions for co-op and singleplayer. theres no hastle of going to",1
"super fun game great for price and tons of fun downloadable content and multiplayer is not cod sqeakers fest",2
"the problem with this game is that its not in your library yet",3
"i love this game well worth the 30 bucks from steam sale",3
"really nice game especially with mods and custom game modes",1
"this game has the most hardcore roleplayers ive ever seen. nothing quite like it.",1
"very fun detailed game and all the user made missions are awesome",4
"i bought this game to be able to play it with a friend. i played operation flashpoint back in 2001 and was amazed, but i have never touched an operation flashpoint / arma game since then. i wasnt expecting too much. i would have never thought that it would become one of my favorite games ever. the gameplay is rather slow and very tactical compared to the battlefield series and shooters like call of duty. when playing multiplayer, you sometimes have to drive for 10 minutes, walk another 5 to get to your picked location and then slowly crawl up to your enemy - which sounds boring, but is very very exciting because you have to carefully plan your moves, predict what your enemy does and then strike. the graphics are very nice too, sometimes you just want to sit down and enjoy a sunset on the island but then the impressively accurate sound of a helicopter pulls you out of the paradise and reminds you that you are on a battlefield. i can highly recommend this game to everyone who is fed up with the always identical cods and battlefields.",1
"most played in my library for a reason... the workshop and people who continuosly add more to this game make it worth every penny and some! this game fills the role as a war sim, survival, rp, helicopter, fighter jet and even go kart game... and so much more... do it",5
"i loved the little time i had with this. for some reason steam wont let me play it for free for the free weekend (maybe because its already in my library.) anyways, this is not your run-of-the-mill cod nonsense.",1
"among many things my favorite thing about this game is that empty brass exits the weapon and makes a ping if it hits a metal floor, and that bullets are effected by spin drift/wind/ and gravity. tough to get it to run well at 5760 x 1080 but very emersive when it does. with all the bohemia content and user created content ported over from arma 2 its definatly worth the full price.",3
"bad game. horrible game engine. system requirements for what? nope company. few models. multiplayer always glitches. waste of money.",1
"put simply, this is the only first person shooter that any self respecting gamer needs to buy. it has it all.",4
"i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone cause its a multiplayers worst nightmare. the engine is old as , the fps on my new alienware pc is 20fps in multiplayer. un optimized piece of crap people, i bought it in beta and it still sucks. if there were a demo i could of saved 44 dollars but got screwed in the ! save your money maybe take a date to a nice resteraunt, who knows maybe youll get laid. anyways im saving you from a bad decision!",1
"the ultimate military simulator that you can actually afford. highly customizable but comes with a learning curve. has a lively public community in the forms of altis life roleplay or instant-action king of the hill, but for the real experience you should find a clan or community to play missions with.",2
"almost a perfect infantry combat experience. the peripheries arent quite polished, especially air combat, and there is a lack of content in the base game, but the ability to make mods for this game is what really makes it shine. overall i give this game a 9/10",4
"i got banned for hacking in weapons to test weapons vehicles with my buddies whilst the game was in beta now i am still banned and i need to pay another 45 euro to play on another account",1
"perfect game for tactical and military strategic gamplay! not for fun like running around and trolling. if you want to do that go f**k yourself and go get a life.",4
"great game, especially enjoy the role playing servers. the only place someone will scream bib;ical scripture at you and shoot out your tyres outside of the usa. 10/10",1
"big learning curve, but super realistic. its a sandbox war simulator, so you can literally be or do almost anything! really good fun once you learn the ropes and find a good squad to play with.",4
"ive played 20 hours of this game, 18 of them have been in altis life alone, and the rest in wasteland and single player. this is one of the most enjoyable games ive ever played. when im not playing, i think about what im going to do when i play altis life next. a little about altis life. its basically real life in arma 3. you can play as a cop or a civillian. if you play as a cop, you enforce the law. pull people over for speeding, hunt down criminals, bust druggies. if youre a civillian, you can become a rebel, and basically be the bandits of altis life, or you can just make drugs, and sell them and become a millionaire. the choice is yours. i highly recomend this game, as long as you can deal with a few bugs. if you do end up buying the game. i highly recommend playing altis life. no mods/downloads needed. all you have to do is join a server, and remember the server name so you can continue where you left off. (and before you exit the game, please remember to sync you data :)",1
"confusing piece of crap, poorly optimised, can not get any decent fps even with everything minimum, which is un-playable. key binds are ridiculous.",1
"so i played this game when it was free for 3 days and i only played it for a little while. first of all the game was not very well optimized and i found it to be pretty laggy especially in multilipayer with around 50 people playing and bullets and missles going everywhere. i thought that this was a really releastic game becuase of just how many people there are in a game and how its like a big fire fight. i would have to say for people who have lots of money to spend on games, go ahead and buy it if you have a gaming machiene that can handle this game and get playable frame rates. (recommend an $1000 pc minimum) but if you play free games like me and dont have an extreme pc build i dont really recommend the game that much.",1
"optimize your  game bohemia interactive, there is no reason i can play bf4 completely maxed at an average 80 fps yet have issues running this game smoothly at all.",1
"solid game with a great deal of features, the avid mil-sim shooter enthusiast will enjoy. there are still a few issues with the game one of which being the lack of easy add-on support and the abissmal vehicle sync between players. i would recommend this game but be warned, this game is not for the faint of heart!",1
"this is the ultimate military sandbox. modding, making your own missions, you name it! to quote dyslecxi: have you paid any attention to whats come out for a3 free since it was released? zeus, virtual arsenal, stamina/sway systems, a new flight model, fire-from-vehicles, sling loading... thats not even the full list, those are just some notable items that come to mind. they give away almost everything for free and then people  and moan because theres a small amount of paid content that helps to fund those free features for those who choose to do so. after seeing some of the complaints people have had with the very generous approach bis has taken with the a3 dlc, its no wonder companies like ea and similar just dont give a  and make it 100% paid content that youll never have a chance to touch unless you pony up the dough.",3
"good game but the weapons dont impress me i want to see weapons i saw in arma 2 with different gun sounds.",1
"best arma so far es[ecialy physics of the vehicles, as well as its amazing graphics!",1
"too advanced, and teamates will ditch you constantly. also many framerate issues.",1
"i crashed a helicopter and made a grown man cry because we all died and lost the mission. 20/10",1
"absolutly briliant! lots of diversity with a big moding community. one of the few modern fps games that focuses on tactics and teamwork as well as player moddifications and not dlc and profit. by far the all around best game i have played, extremly satisfying when you succeed with something you plan out with your friends!",2
"the only fps that allows you to run straight and look left and right! thumbs up! i downloaded arma 3 to play the breaking point and epoch mods. both are great! highlly recommend!",5
"tank hits rock, tank flies, tank shoots, tank flies even faster. water try and stop tank, tank bounce, tank flies happily ever after. tank/10 would fly again.",1
"im really pissed off at how much this game lags even though i have a nice computer with a radeon 7970 in it... i really wanted it to run good, its part of the reason i got my gaming computer in the first place and i cant even play it without getting pissed off because of lag. should have been optimized better. its a really cool game, which is why im recomending it, but im really sad about the lag. even on low settings with a friggin radeon and a good ammount of ram.",1
"great game 10/10 nice single player i see myself spending a lot of hours on multiplayer with all the great mods.",1
"this game is great realistic, simulated military game a picture is very good. but this game to use a high degree of difficulty, i was a china game player, like playing the game, people can communicate together. i qq:572262378",1
"a whole tastatur for play...before u find the right key u dead.",1
"missleading requirements.... the minumun cpu is i5.. this game is garbage for amd cpus as well.. this game would had been amazing but the programmers of this game, game engine are noobs in their proffession.. its a stoneage technology.. seriously they should fire every programmers they have and recriut newly graduate... their employees need to go back to school.. you cannot call them professional anymore.. people with high end pc should boycot this so that we will be forcing them to freaking create app that can use of multicore cpus....",1
"great game. the ai takes a little bit of getting used to and the land drones wont cross bridges on their own but once you get past all of that youll learn to love the game.",2
"very good game, it can be quite boring if you dont have anyone to play it with. although i tell you, there is plenty of friendly and good players out there to join in with. no external friends required. i give this game 8.5/10, it loses 1.5 points because it can be rather buggy at times and quite badly optimized. it has great graphics, very good community, adrenaline pumping moments and it hits the line perfectly between realism and virtual, it is all you could ever want in a military simulation game.",3
"at first it was not like any war game. it was one of the worst. then i played it a bit more. i do not believe love on first sight, so i built it up. now i love this game more than any other game! you just need to find your favourite game modes (that players have scripted) like king of the hill or altis life. everyone can find their own! just make sure you do not play alone. fighting alone in war is not fun! also, i strongly recommend using your brain to come out from difficult situations. 360 noscope will not help you in arma.",4
"can write review even though i dont own. good game tho 121034104014021040/10",1
"havnt even played vanilla arma 3 but the mod scene is great. would recommend to anyone.",2
"as the 3rd installment to the arma series the quality that this game brings to the table is unpresidented in any other arma game. with the rv4 it adds in directx 11 to bring stunning new visuals never seen before in the franchise. the clunky mechanics from arma 2 have been reworked and are now fluid as ever in arma 3. although the game was rough at launch with performance the series of patches have vastly improved performance and by far is the smoothest arma to date! multiplayer is better than ever with the new vehicles new guns! overall id recommend this product to anyone who likes realistic shooters!",2
"this game is the best if you get it you will love so much",1
"such a great game. once you get over the learning cure then its such a joy to play",1
"the game it self, is ok. but all the mods for this game make it as enjoyable as it is.",3
"this is a funny game but its small bugs in it :( but i recommend this game if you like war simulation games.",1
"this game is . im trying to play the campaign and cant get past the first mission because the enemies are either invincible or the ing gun doesnt ever ing hit them. i put the reticle right on them and they dont ever die. i even switched to the easiest difficulty but that didnt change a thing. this is the worst game in the world. this is the reason i like battlefield. it doesnt suck. you can actually hit the stuff youre aiming at.",1
"awesome game. love it. cant wait for more updates to come and this is way better than any other game",2
"yeah i like the game. it just doesent have the arma 2 feel to it. it feels to bland and boring. dont get me wrong its a good game but i dont see my self putting tons of hours into this like i did arma 2.",1
"greedy dlc, the game is still in beta. the funnest thing to do by far is koth online but good luck getting in a server, randomly the server broswer will flip out and report 0 servers. at which time the only solution is to completely restart the game. every time hearing that stupid theme when it starts up, duh duh dunnn duh! server broswer reports 0 servers, restart.... duh duh dunnn duh! 15 bucks for a couple of rifles and diffrent color guillie suits <.<, helicopter pack 15 bucks, still in beta my . money grab, poorly optimized 6/10 duh duh dunnn duh! ....... 5/10",2
"this game was just too slow for me.. some servers are meh at best. the maps are so large and the server populations are so low, its a very slow experience. ive tried several of the game modes, which does tend to make for a different play experience, but for me, i like combat atleast every 3-5 mins in a game versus running/driving/flying across maps for 10 mins to get to the action.",1
"arma 3 is an amazing game with an amazing community. beat the campaign and the showcases? you can go over to the workshop and download some more maps. want to play a map made by you? hop on to the mission editor and make the mission however you want, and if you want to, post it on the workshop. the game itself has amazing combat mechanics, accurate portrayal of real firefights, and can provide hours of amazing fun.",1
"what do i look for in a good military first person strategy shooting? great graphics. check. great gameplay. check. great multiplayer and user generated structure. check. array of budder blocks and swords. ing false. this game is missing budder. no swords. no armor. no blocks. no buy. 0/10",1
"got tazed and fined for driving 2km over the speed limit. 11/10 would play again.",1
"i will buy this the next time theres a sale where the games under 20. i sampled it for the free trial and it was very good.",1
"10/10 best game for players that love tema work!!!!!!!",4
"let me tell ya sth bout this gaem... 1) its 10/10 for noscoping noobs thats think that bcz they are good att bf and cod they are good at any game. 2) 15fps on low in a city still worth, not playable but worth 3) graphics, meh...id go for full high no matter whats your pc your so or so not gonna have good fps even on low so why watch sh*t when you can watch the 10/10 graphics 4) engine, meh you cant jump... still 10/10 10/10 would play again if it wasnt for decync and my sh*t net",1
"more like a grapical update for arma ii, not realy adding much else instead of adding what i thought bohimia would which was addign most of the features that the ace & acre did, (mods for arma ii)",1
"very cpu intensive, but great graphics. has many different gamemodes to play. dont recommend buying this game if you have a bad computer. but overall a great game",1
"rabbits can open doors. hell yeah id recommend this game.",1
"all my hours are on altislife and this game is so fun. you need to buy it",3
"alright game. its poorly optimized so you need a monster to run this well. i run on low settings with a gaming laptop, my specs are 8 gb ram, 740m video card, and i get 15-20 fps which is super . comparatively, i play bf3 on high settings with 30-40 fps easily. overall, if it were optimized properly and the community worked together more, it would make the game a 10/10. however, lacking these aspects i have to give it a 6.",1
"something between americas army and battlefield, this game gives me what i need regarding realism and graphic design. the performance on custom missions definitely needs improvement - sadly, nothing seems to be happening anymore. either way, i recommend!",2
"everybody should buy it! you can do almost everything in this game and its really cool as an army simulator...",1
"this game is great, however you should get it with friends or join a clan right away.",5
"so for some reason, i have an i5 4670k with 4 gb gtx770, and i get 15 frames per second no matter what. when i first got the game, it was fine, but a few updates ago, it went to hell. one of the top voted issues on their feedback tracker is that the game does not utilize your computers full power thats been on there since march. their feedback tracker is more like that broken down suggestions box you see at a grocery store, hidden away in the corner, covered in cobwebs, and forgotten. maybe a janitor might see it one day. probably not.",2
"runs very welll on low end computers and high, i find this a very grapical game of fun and open world exploration along with mods of sorts from planes to guns, very well made game, graphics beat xbox type games, crank it up on high and have fun",4
"its a b movie simulator. you walk around, spot popcorn sounds and die to a stiff soldier.",1
"would be good if they fixed the performance issues and shiity servers and the compatibillty with different drivers ect. come on arma ing get your act together! :d re edit: arma 3 is a decent game with alot to do and is very fun, it may have quite alot of dsync but still. it is very fun to play with friends especially on my favourite altis life where you can process and sell coacaine and even take marjeuna. this game is good but you better have a good pc, and hopefully a 15 or better otherwise your screwed and though amd and radeon is good, its sadly not good for arma. but stilll this is an amazing game :d",1
"i had a lot of fun with this game but these bugs and laggs and the fact that this game sometimes didnt work at all make it unplayable. so if you wanna get f*cked up by lagg etc this is the right game for you!",2
"this game is just so mutch u can do in :d its epic for my, base building, rp, fps, it got everything",2
"i saw a rabbit followed by a civilian followed by a private followed by a colonel hunted by a sniper getting shot by an armored truck locked by a jet ...... only the rabbit survived :p",2
"if you have ever wanted realizem this is it! keep in mind though, most people who think they want realizem dont under stand what that means.",3
"fantastic upgrade from arma 2, new lighting, animations and environment to name a few of the updated features make the game a dream. very fluid and vibrant, takes you into a futuristic war set however with the amount of modifcations available time-frame and setting varies. amazing level of access to scripting allows anyone to modify missions and the game in general to a tailored state.",1
"too bad that there isnt like 50% button,cause i dont really like this game,atlest not that much like arma 2.maybe its cause of the map,or guns,or just cause of both,i dunno...the only thing that i know is,that its not that bad,so i would rate like 6,5/10",1
"i havent played it too much but i can safely say make some friends and make your friends get this. cause its hella more fun when you have a group to play with.",1
"i like chicken, and bacon too. oh.. yeah, arma3 is pretty sick aswell...",1
"it says i am missing a package and wont let me play.",1
"i wish people played more pvp in this game. not altis life but other than that it is a great game",3
"i went online, ended up in a go-kart with a hmg on top, and then getting a nuke and exploding everywhere from hitting a small rock with a gokart. 10/10 gotay",3
"this is by far the worst campaign i have ever played. the only fun mission is the first one, the second one is absolutly horrible. you have to get to a camp in 10 mintues but there are 50 ai that are pro shots that will kill you instantly. oh yea i forgot to mention, there are ied/ landmines everywhere. the multiplayer is alright, i can only get in about maby 3 servers out of 200 update: i really like this game after playing it bunch. still the campaign sucks but the senarios are pretty cool. multiplayer can be fun if you get a good server. i like playing on patrol ops. anyways i give campaign 3/10, multiplayer, 8/10",1
"highly recommended for serious tactics-gamers. lightyears away from more or less arcade-games like battlefield 3, cod etc. even as an alpha-release its already a great game with really benchmarking features in tactics, gameplay and suspense. as the subtitle says: this is war - or at least something very similar.",1
"it was a long road but now arma3 is a really good game with many gamemodes and options as arma2 was but it also has kept some of the old issues...but in my opinion it is a must have :d",2
"i cannot recommend this game, mainly beacuse it runs like hell. i have tried the game on two diffrent computers (one with gtx 580 and one with gtx 770 gpu) and still very rarely get above 40 fps in multiplayer. and that is on standard settings. battlefield 4 on the other hand runs with an average of above 100 fps on very high settings (no aa though but 90 fov). i like the concept of the game and if the performance issues gets solved ill give the game another try, but as of now i have tried the game on multiple occasions since march 2012 and it still doent work. note however that while the game has superb scale and huge empahsis on teamwork - which is great - the core of the game is still far worse then any of the other major fpses. shooting in this game is irregular, laggy and the action menu is terrible. i really like the shooting mechanics in red orchestra 2 but in arma they are damn awful. flying helicopters is quite fun though and very challening (unlike battlefield).",1
"it was the only game i played till i had 140hrs on it. o.o",2
"awesome just awesme if you liked arma 2 you will love arma 3",2
"great military sim. this does not play out like a run-and-gun game like bf4. this is a tactical shooter and you have to take movement slow and methodical. ai is extremely efficient at killing you, so you cant go in guns-blazing. it has about 5 different character classes to choose from, as well as rarely used vehicles. each class has their own abilites and weaponry. i would not recommend this game to anyone except those who have a high end cpu and video card because this games graphics and netcode are very poorly optimized, causing even the best computers to run at low fps. i have an i7-4790k overclock 4.4ghz cpu, 16 gig ram, and gtx780s in sli and i get from 30-50 fps in multiplayer. most ppl get below 30.",2
"this game is fun to play with friends or by your self. there are lots of game modes you can download and install such as: battle royal,wastland,altis life ext. if you are bored of playing multiplayer (dont know how you would be) you could play the campain or play some of the show cases. 10/10",1
"yes i recommend this game! it totally lives up to its price! you should play it because there is awesome graphics! i playing it and the is stratis life its the best life rp there is! so buy this game!",1
"this game is something unique and special pros: -modding community makes aditional content almost infinate. (there are some mods in development that look very promissing, im looking at you dayz epoch for arma 3) -massive map to explore -scenarion editor makes almost any imganinable scenario possible -extremely relistic (this could be a con to some) -graphically impressive for its size -massive longevity considering both the mod availiability and the scenario editor -very detailed environment cons -buggy, like very buggy, like has the potenial to ruin your day buggy -very steep learning curve, prepare to spend the first few in game hours learning how to move let along fly, drive, command a squad etc... -so buggy it deserve two mentions. -poorly optimized. no matter what setting i use i cannot run anything over high and even that ryns at 30fps. dont even both if you have a low end pc. overall this game has things to offer that no other game does but it suffers because of an engine that is difficulty for any pc to run. i fully recomend but understand if you pass it over because it looks so intimidating.",1
"best military simulator ive ever played. all its missing is tons of weapons. but what it has is great!",2
"pretty good. graphics do cause a few glitches. sadly i keep dying in the campaign as kerry. but besides that, its not bad. 10/10 would bang.",1
"biggest issue: aiming was messed up with an update which actually promotes camping as taking shots makes you really unaccurate. graphics: very realistic and nice. textures are hit and miss but ragdolls are awful. desync and hitdection kill the multiplayer. performance is awful with any hardware due to unoptimised engine. story is generic. ai are either god like or brain dead. overally lacks a lot of features and fixes but had a lot of potenital.",1
"this game goes above and beyond. the way you play the game is completely up to you. if you want to be in a big  artillery piece than you can do it. if you wanna fly guns and provide close air support than you can do it. you can roll into a town in a big  tank and blow  up or you can kill a high-value target from over a mile away. its up to you. with a map of 270 square kilometers the playing field is huge. if you though battlefield maps were big, its time to put your big-boy pants on. arma 3 is by far the best shooter/milsim there is. buy it",2
"this games brings really fun and is addictive :> great workshop and mods makes this game even better. really worth to buy if you are looking for something to play longer than 1 hour.",2
"totally worth the try since alpha phase if you are into tactical shooters.",1
"the best game i have bought for me :p best simulator, best game of the year !!",2
"this is a fantastic game with a good realistic gunplay system.",1
"this game is awesome! people actually play online, a personal favourite gamemode of mine is capture the island. this is pretty much domonation on a bigger scale. if anyone gets this game-please let me know so we can play it at some point. also, the graphics are incredible, especially when on ultra!",2
"absolutly love this game i love that i can be creative and make the maps stratis and atlis a warzone in my way definly the best game i have ever played i give this game a rating 100%",3
"i have fallin in love with this game. altis life is the best mod on this game. the roleplay and every situation is diffrent every time i long on. the flying, driving, diving, selling drugs, taking kindnies, robbing , minning and much more. the single player is alright but all the mods and the community make up for it.",2
"i remember playing this game after getting a taste of arma 2 and i was so disappointed. i joined a invade and anex server and got killed over and over by the super op aim hack ai. i was just about to rage quit, when one of the server group members asked me if i wanted to join their squad to play with them. they told me what to do and after an hour i got the sweet taste of arma team play. i joined the group after a while and started playing user made missions with mods and holy . it has been the best year of gaming i have ever had. if you like millitary tactics and teamplay, arma is right up your alley. it is not like any of the big fpss out there, you dont feel like a action movie super soldier. you feel just as vulnerable as the other guy on the receiving end of your barrel. if you are ever going to play this for the milsim part of the game, get yourself a group to play with. nr. one advice. i watch this every time i wonder why i play arma and i just want more:",5
"ive had this game for quite a long time but never really found what to do with it.,..until i found altis life! wow! its so much fun roleplaying as a civ trying to find his way on altis island. if you like roleplaying and are open to all sorts of avenues that appear in front of you, then this is definitely the game for you! top drawer!!",3
"i like this game for its realism and amazing at a militery simulator. the only bad thing about it is the physics........",1
"shooty shooty good, driving okay, flying hard. 10/10 bullets either tickle or are fired near you and you die.",1
"its a great game, i mostly like the rpg mods but thats just me, what do you think?",1
"this game is the best army simulator anyone will ever play. i like how you can pick about anything for your character to use or wear. every thing is realistic in this game and i highly recomend this game!",3
"i love altis life its like the real lifei love this game i allways have fun playing it its so awsome 10/10",1
"this game is 10/10, i love it. definatly a big step from arma ii",1
"this game is the best military simulation games, and the best multiplayer gameplay i have played so far. highly recomended",2
"this game is a whole new meaning of awesome. the succesor of the very fun arma 2, arma 3 is beautiful and lively yet at the same time can become a giant battlefield of fun and thats why i love this game. if this hasnt convinced you to get this amazing game, well youre missing out.",2
"arma 3 has a lot of detail when it comes to its graphics which is good but it can also have some bad points, although it is realistic half the time you cant see your enemies because the sun is in your way. a massive problem with arma 3 is the ai, they are totally un-realistic i once used a sniper to shoot at an ai who took cover on the ground and as it was long distance i missed using a sniper, he stood up and returned fire hitting me with about 3 of his 4 shots. at the distance he shot at it would be impossible with an assault rifle. ive never really found arma as a game i would play by myself because it becomes boring and repetitive especially when you keep dying and most of the game consists of travelling to the battle. i like arma 3 and i would suggest it to everbody because you can have some good times on it. but the game itself needs to have a lot of work for it to be a game i would consistantly play.",1
"its a very realistic simulator one of the best and with pretty grapics but with its price i would only recommend this game to people who will play it often",2
"this is one of the all time great games. it is a beautiful open world sandbox with so much content it is almost limitless what is possible. highly recommend.",2
"great graphics, bit glitchy, mods, fun with freinds, and you can play serious or mess around",1
"extremely realistic and fun milsim mmo. reccomend for anyone who likes, well, games!",3
"like arma 2, but prettier. still an endless amount of mods, now if only the ace and acre mods were released to this soon, this would be a near perfect game.",1
"very very fun game, especially with zeus mode. get it.",3
"this game reall suprised me i plan to buy it soon and get the breaking point mod for it.",1
"this game is friggin awesome! basically, it is like battlefield 4 on steriods. although multiplayer is pretty laggy, arma 3 is one of my favorites.",1
"bleh, didnt like this game, i know a lot of other people love it but its in my opinion just a boring shooter army game. i played arma 2 and had the same issues as well. i dont recommend this to anyone.",1
"this is pretty much a military version of garrys mod w/o the physic gun 10/10",2
"arma 3 is the most expensive game on steam. only people who work at nasa can aford it, this is because you require a degree in quantum physics to be able to remember the controls.",1
"with mod tools, lean, serious communities supported by dedicated servers, arma 3 will satisfy veteran pc gamers used to all the amenities that so many franchises dropped, because the game stays true to its roots yet innovates in such a way that expands the possibilities, but does not limits them.",1
"any fan of the arma series needs no recommendation for this game, it builds on years of quality gameplay. since arma 2 there have been however alot of positive improvements, and despite this only being an alpha build for now, it shows just how much arma 3 has build on and improved upon the old game. you can play it with outstanding graphics without needing a beast of a computer, and even the alpha versions runs smoother on my rig then arma 2 ever did. it still has its bugs, but none sofar ive seen break the fun of the game. for those new to the arma series this game is as perfect a starting point to get to know the series, as it like all before it, stand alone building their own story line. no need to have played the first 2 games of the series is required to get started on this one. if you like tactical gameplay, and cant stand the twitch run-and-gun gameplay of modern shooters (cod for example) then this game is perfect for you.",3
"the best war simulator there is. plus its on sale now... go buy it!!!",1
"awesome game! screw bf and cod this is where the fun is at!",1
"as a battlefield fan for its slightly more tactical approach to combat (if you play it right) then call of duty, i can say ive never played a game like this, its more tactical then any game i could of imagined being. i love this game and would recommend it to anybody who isnt a call of duty fan.",1
"arma 3 is the perfect driving simulator if you are a woman. if you are a man, you will hate how feminine your driving will become. flying helicopters is just like it used to be, hilariously dangerous for everyone around you. the only problem with the game is the map. the only problem with bohemia is understanding what optimizing means. 9/10 milky ways suck",1
"from the short time i played it, it seemed like it would be a fun and well done game. i had too much lag to give it a thorough rundown but some highlights would be the vehicle pyshics, the fatigue and movement factors, recoil, and even armor penetration. the down side is the enormous ammount of cpu usage and the graphics card you would need to run this game. in the future, i would like to see them add a very low graphics setting for people who have to buy computers on a budget and cant get a new one every year. would i recommend this game? for now, i am going to go with a yes because several of my friends have it and love it and after playing it, no matter how little or laggy, it seemed to have some pretty cool features.",1
"this is great simullator, very fun and realistic. waiting can be long but there is an option to speed up time, which is great!",1
"waste of time. on regular difficulty even if you sneak near a soldier and shoot him 3 times in the head from ~2-5 meters with nato ammo, the guy will still turn around and shoot you. even if you can almost see the sweats on his forehead, you -a nato trained soldier with thousands of hours of training- cant kill anything from a 2m distance. great simulation! wait until this garbage costs about 10 euros, then it will be worth the effort. on the plus side: the maps are huge! too bad there are no birds and insects to see, at least that would be meaningful.",1
"one of the better games i have played in a long time and the reason i will probably never play planetside 2 again. with massive and beautifully detailed maps, an impressive array of vehicles and just about any weapon and gadget you can think of its a war geeks dream. there is a stack of great community content available in the workshop too which gives the game unlimited playability and due to the sandbox nature of the game it can literally be anything! cannot recommend highly enough.",5
"what can i say about aram 3 that hasnt already been said, this is a great title endless gameplay with modded support you can play games like wasteland,altis life,king of the hill and many more arma 3 set a good exsample of a new arma game and thats alot because arma 2 is still very popular today due to there mods.",1
"pretty fun though i only really play the wasteland mod.",2
"great game. awesome mechanics, a great improvement from previous armas. beautiful and astonishing graphics. wonderful atomoshphere, extremely detailed. now with the campagin there is much more to do besides creating maps or playing with friends on a server. my favorite is that it has its own workshop !",1
"a brilliant game but it does have its limits. i think that theres not anything wrong with the game but i can see room for minor improvements like maybe more maps like town and city maps in a forrest enviroment like on arma 2 so we can get the best of both games. i understand this game was only released recently but i still think that great things will come of this game. i recommend it to all my friends since the online features like the different servers allows you to play how you want.",1
"i bought the game and a few weeks with out playing becuase my pc broke it wants me to buy it agian and all my games that i bought are like this but it was a good game",1
"excellent game. if you are one of those people that didnt enjoy arma 2 due to the sometimes ifie gameplay, the game play in arma 3 much more enjoyable. gameplay: 9/10 editor: 10/10",1
"great game. imo, more realistic than arma 2, better graphics engine. i was able to run it in 1600x960p. recoil is not that of a damn barrett .50 cal when you are shooting a pistol. cooler story and just overall an advancement from arma 2. op af",1
"really worth buying. you can go ride go-karts, play battle royale with friends, play breaking point with friends, play wasteland with friends. the only problem with the game is when you dont have any friends that have this game to play with. 9/10 from me.",1
"man where can i start. this game has made me forget any other game out there (including bf4)...so many options and possibilities. after surviving a really intense firefight our squad made it out alive. we requested to be picked up and the nearest vehicle was a m939 truck i believe. we replenished our ammo and equipment and on our way to the next target our driver fell asleep and we all got killed in the crash...good times. warning: if you do not want to spend hours and hours playing do not buy.",1
"the controls and gameplay are way too clunky for me. i dont get the appeal it has for people, maybe i missed something?",1
"very fun game that is worth every pennny. make sure you have a good rig! it will help immensly!",1
"great game but isnt as expansive as arma 2. amazing graphics though",1
"this game is growing so fast and the mods add a ton of new gameplay.....a must buy to be part of a great community",1
"if you have friends that have the game then yes you should buy it. it is also a fun game to play by yourself. arma iii is an all around game that if you are willing to buy and enjoy it, you will love it!",1
"like 2, except with equipment that would be too expensive to outfit all of todays modern infantry with. oh, and the swimming and underwater stuff is nice. it still suffers from frame rate issues, unfortunately.",1
"stratigic game, in this game you actually have to think :o unlike the  game cod",2
"arma 3 is arguably the single most realistic and immersive experience you can find today. it took me quite a while to get it running well, however after its up and running you wont be able to put it down. the maps are insanely huge, allowing for intense tactics. the realism of the guns is where this game really shines. while some may complain that the kick is not entirely realistic you have to adjust the sights for distance. if you get shot even once you will either be dead or have an injury such as a broken leg which only allows you to walk. overall this game is a 9.5/10. aside from some performance issues this game is nothing short of amazing",1
"this game is good and all.. but its complete garbage. first of all its fun..... when it actually works... i bought the game for 40 bucks. had fun... but now i cant even ing connect to stupid piece of  server without the game ing about how its stopped working. if it worked 10/10. but its so  i have to give it a 0/10",1
"superb game. needs a beefy computer but will run full 60 fps on ultra on my pc. specs: intel i3-3220, evga geforce gtx 750 ti ftw, 8gb ram clocked @1600mhz, 2 tb wd hdd, 500 gb wd hdd, 750 watt psu",1
"the best simulation and war game i ever play...that game build his own history to the hall of fame of video games!",1
"this game is great, better optimized than arma 2, resulting in better frames, and all the mods for it make it a overall great game.",1
"great gameplay, greath graphics and tactical combat. love it!",1
"great game especialy the mood atlis life and dayz lot of fun and realistic behavior on multiplay",1
"good game but needs an update from the last it keeps crashing, its never crashed on me before get ur  together boheamia",1
"rear view mirrors actually show whats behind you. 11/10",1
"im glad i could play arma 3 for free on this last weekend, thus preventing me from buying it, ever. every game should give buyers this option, to try before buying. while arma 3 may be a good game, im sure now that its not for me. i have been playing bf for a long time, even bf4 now, and i think bf spoiled me. i really tried enjoying arma 3, but i couldnt. in my humble opinion: bad graphics, bad optimization, bad performance, bad gameplay, bad controls, bad hud, bad voip, bad campaign and bad multiplayer. ive spent nearly one hour on multiplayer driving a truck around the map, trying to figure what to do, how to get a weapon and where were my team mates. before that i tried campaign, with no satisfaction either. its is an expensive game. im really glad i didnt bought it.",1
"this game is totaly waste of money for amd owners. getting too low fps with poor cpu - gpu usage. fps around 15-30 with high settings and its dramaticly same with low settings too. not optimized for amd cpu - apu. totaly unplayable for amd owners. i opened a ticket on steam cs for refund my money.",1
"huge map awesome graphics only in arma moments not recommended for those that want a fast paced shooter or dont have a reasonable pc sweet game thumbs up :)",2
"im not good at the game first of all and i dont know how and what it is about",2
"so basically... its the best game ever made ever. the game is my picture....buy it.",3
"seem to bight and blochie. the physics engin seem broken. seems less gun to me. need dlc for certain things. avatar seems always hurt even at full health. the scnery was nice. modding guns was ok. keybored actions had me tripped up a bit. i give this game 3/5",1
"buggy as hell. they never fixed weird issues like being able to walk through walls. hard to tell when youve actually shot someone. no real visual indicator that youve shot someone, so you end up shooting them 5 times out of confusion. single player campaign seems badly thought out. i basically had to save scum to get off of the first island. ai is awful. no armory mode or quick mission mode. i regret buying this in alpha.",1
"10/10 played invade and annex server was in a helicopter for 1 real life hour and then got shot down",1
"so good really recommened it to everyone such a good game 20/10",2
"this game was a bit frustrated after counter strike, but after a few hours of playing, i realised, it is not so bad. it is a totally different, and i must learn how to play this game. after a while, i understand, the flow of the game, so now i like it much better. i recommend this game, for those, who like open area combats, and slow gameplay compare to counter stike. it is more like real world.",1
"recommending this game is a no-brainer. if you are even into shooters with a nag for realism arma 3 is inevitable. the game wont let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like cod or battlefield. the best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. groups range from run-and-gun type gameplay up to strictly milsim stuff, so there should be something for everybody.",2
"installed jsrs 2.0 sound mod,ended up with ptsd and ringing in my ears 10/10 would play again if the nightmares stop.",5
"really good game. if you liked arma 2... you will like arma 3 better!",2
"really awesome game, but the performance is just all over the place or terrible.",1
"the day life of arma 3 1. join server 2. spawn in kavala 3. random people shooting at you 4. run for it on the 5 dollar quadbike you bought. 5. go to weed field 6. collect drugs 7. break car in middle of no where 8. walk for 4 hrs. 10/10 walking sim 2015",1
"if you cant get a head shot from 200 meters with iron sights, avoid because evan on the easiest difficulty, the ai can.",1
"knocked a guy out, stole his kidney then sold it for drug money and got arrested. 11/10 would steal a kidney again",1
"new mechanics, less gear. thats all i can say. i miss the mass of equipment in arma 2, now a days you can buy some more  purely for vanilla mp servers. so yeah, equipment is in lower quantity with a bit better quality. the downside is the s want you to pay 66 bucks still, i payed around 30 or so when it first came out. so, i recommend this game, lots of cool , but on the other hand ill point out the lack of crap in comparison to arma 3, also vanilla maps suck. modding it is a helpful option to deal with the lack of vanilla .",2
"my friends and i spent 5 minutes in a tank shooting at a bush on the road thinking it was a person. best game ever 15/10",1
"grate game you can get a lot of fun in to this game",1
"this is the military game that ive always wanted to play. sadly you need a high end gaming computer just to play it. i was given a copy of alpha lite and it wouldnt open because i dont have a gaming computer. ive heard great things about this game but do not buy this if you dont have a gaming computer.",1
"great....but the for online if you wanted to do anything besides....grunt work then you need teamspeak or the server admins will rage bann you...all of them....",2
"much improved over arma ii. loads of downloadable content especially for multiplayer/co-op. the ai is smart enough so that each scenario is not exactly the same every time. on the down side, development seems to be a bit slow. there are still some glitches, and patches arent released regularlly. some of the keystrokes take some getting used to. if you are using mouse/keyboard, do yourself a favor and practice flying the helos before attempting to use them in missions. 4/5 stars.... with potential! loads of fun to play",1
"i dont own this game but it let me write this review. 420/360 - ign would review again.",1
"its like arma 2 but better in every way. so its not like arma 2",1
"this game is a a lot of fun for the right players. looking for non-stop spawn and die? then its prolly not for you. looking for some slower paced tactical action mixed with some intense battles? its in there.",3
"train simulator with tanks and youll be teamkilled more than you encounter an enemy.",3
"as always the mod comunity makes arma iii far more fun than the guys at bohemia . altis life dayz breaking point wasteland to name a few mods worth looking at .",1
"love the game since operation flashpoint, i have made missions since then too. paying for dlc that was in arma 2 though? no thanks. spamming me ingame to buy your dlc may make you money but it ruins my immersion in the game and does not a military sim make. the fact this needs pointed out at all makes me realise this franchise has lost its way completely. p.s. you can stick your bipods, too little too late military sim creators",4
"arma3... enogh sayed.. if u dont have it get it, if u dont want it get it, if u dont have the money 2 get it save up and get it, if u played arma 2 and enjoyed it, delete it and get arma3...",2
"the reputation of this game speaks for itself, however, if you want a more indept military shooter; join the army! this game is in its own class....",1
"recently changed the game to a thumbs up. very steep learning curve, mostly because of the clunky interface. graphics are great, especially the night ops with thermals and night vision goggles. head to head multiplayer is still a lag fest but the co-op mode works fine. the various modded servers that are not arma 3 confuse new players who want to jump into the game to only figure out they are actually not playing the designed game. pros : great graphics, nighttime play, large scale battles, combined arms forces cons : steep learning curve, fictional weapons and vehicles (why?) , no rally point system that makes constant helicopter rides (5-10 min) per unrevived death.",1
"awesome multiplayer game, but not always very good optimized.",1
"best military simulator out there. multiplayer is fun and more polished than arma ii. loving the new features, too. if you liked arma ii, youll like this one, too. oh, and i forgot to mention you can mod it, just like arma ii. cant wait for ace.",1
"i love arma. the realism of the game is unsurpassed in this market. if youre coming from the run-and-gun call of duty styled gaming, you may hate this game off the bat. it is designed to be a simulator more than anything i find. there is no hiding behind a wall and magically healing those bullet wounds. i would recommend this to anyone who is interested in a challenging, open world, shooter. where adaptation is always a key effort, and utilizing team work is a must for ease of completion. be patient though if this is your first arma game. get comfortable and used to the game and all its features, and you will most likely love it. the mods are a bit difficult to get (for me atleast, wont apply to the game for some reason) but the community is awesome at creating new missions, mods, and gameplay. i have clocked in countless hours, and i regret nothing!",1
"first arma game ive owned along with great frist impressions.",1
"i shot a chicken with a 50 cal sniper rifle and it imploded 10/10",2
"although it has a few issues with netcode, like its predecessor, arma 2, it is a well structured game with modding in mind. this game also possesses quite an arsenal of weapons accurate to their real life counter parts; furthering immersion. what does take away from this is the aformentioned issues with lag that can lead to some rather frustrating moments. i would recommend this to anyone who has quite a lot of patience and those who want to see what real life gun play is all about, short of joining the military or buying your own. 7/10 game",1
"first arma game ive owned along with great frist impressions.",1
"8/8 mate would play arma 3 again m8 i r8 8/8 would masterb8 m8 nice b8 m8",1
"this game is awesome, the amount of customization and moddability is amazing. it is a bit too futuristic for some people, but there are tons of mods that can fix that. tons of fun missions, tons of amazing multiplayer content, this game is absolutely amazing. many people have issues with performance, especially when on multiplayer, what i say to that is oh well, turn down the settings and make do.",3
"do you want a army simulator where the professional army personal cant run farther that just 10 seconds? this is your game!",2
"the perfect way to play arma 3: 1: get 2 ugvs and a buddy. 2: tell your buddy to get into the first ugv while you get into the second. 3: control the ugv that your buddy was in while you have him control yours. 4: drive around like idiots",3
"i thought i would love this game, but after dealing with sloppy menu systems, unoptimized game settings, and ridiculously varying quality in gameplay, i just wish i never spent the money on this. all the online gameplay shown is under incredibly set terms that youll almost never see without dedicating a ton of time to a community with a teamspeak.",1
"great graphics compared to arma 2. its a little buggy but nothing you cant bare with. if you enjoy playing the wasteland mod then its a good buy. just note to self the a.i. is beast, like they are hard af to take down. but the game is so beautiful. the vehicles are great and so is the inventory menu. you can switch out scopes between different weapons. overall a great game",1
"fly a chopper land on tower get blown up die 10/10 game would buy again :steven mcdowall",5
"im just not enjoying it. i really am trying because i see all these great reviews. as a solo player it kinda sucks. i can see how playing in a group would make it much better tho. i love military sims but this one is to buggy and clucky and just not fun, for me anyway. maybe in the future, if i join up with some peeps it might make it fun.",1
"great game but its laggy nature means that sometimes youd be better of dying. 5 or 6 frame per secod and absolutly no sign that the develpers are doing anything about it at all. beta was ace. ran well and dint suffer any issues. the final release with altis and stratis is franky disappointing. the larger island is so big you can roamaround for ages withjout seeing anyone and eventually it lags so badly that you give up and go play something else. until its sorted ill play something else - the developers still got my money though.",1
"arma 3 is a great shooter and just buying one of these games is like getting 6 there so many mods and cool game modes like, epoch, wasteland, altis life and king of the hill these r my favourite gamemodes but there are lots more it combinds elements of rpg fps survival and even racing. 50/10 would agian recomend 100x over",1
"this game is very unrefined. if you play the campaign, use the endmission cheat because some of them bug and some of them are impossible (not kidding.) some missions are fun. i went online and tried some multiplayer. just some dudes driving around in vehicles, nothing fun there but i might try more later since i spent money on this game. overall i dont recommend the game. its clear that you need to modify the game with mods and scripts but the base game and campaing should be involving, fun and consistent.",2
"the most realistic army simulator! the graphics are incredible and the added features make it a good game.",1
"one of the most realistic games ever. gr8 b8 m8 no h8 8/8",1
"this game is very good to say the least with mods and missions coop and pvp and pve is this a fun and fair game and with 100 slots on some servers i can be really fun. if u are doing good but othervise i can get a bit frustated when playing becuse of the small places enemis tend to stay.",1
"love this game. the main reason why is because of the people i play with. if you play on your own it gets a bit boring, however the campaign is rather good. playing in a small group or clan is great fun, tactics used and having a laugh are the best parts of this game. if you played arma 2 (and oa) alot, then you may like this game, unless you prefer the more modern/ww2 style. there is a variety of mods for this game but they are only really good for clan/group ops only, unlike arma 2 where that has entire new themes and a large mod list. i would definitley recommend this game to anyone looking for a laugh and looking for groups to play with. not to mention that the graphics are also stunning.",2
"after the update with the launcher arma and bisudio can go to in hell i uninstalled the game and hope they burn up in hell",4
"just purchased this game on dec 26 2014 arma 3 - digital deluxe edition does not work on my i7 pc and the game keeps crashing i would like my funds returned to my account on steam.",1
"pretty good game... would be a great game if it was better optimized. i would get it on sale but i wouldnt pay full price for it. edit: this game has so much potential but the developers failed to optimize the game at all. do not buy this game until they fix it, if they ever do... so disappointing and such a let down.",1
"owned the game for 2 months and have never looked back... great game",5
"love the battle royale and wasteland not much else",1
"a great game for military enthusiasts, those looking for a run and gun experience similar to cod or battlefield should look elsewhere though. its tough and unforgiving at first, but when the games mechanics click into place it becomes a tactical battle. the game is great for its multiplayer components and the modding community keep releasing some fantastic mini campaigns and scenarios. the world is huge and the selection of vehicles and weapons gives enough diversity to keep the game fresh. theres a lot of running and moments where nothing much happens, but this gives you time to admire the impressive graphics and vistas that are on show. would highly recommend to anyone looking for a patient, realistic and tactical experience of warefare.",1

"easily the best military simulation game out there, solid 10/10.",1
"waited a long time before i decided to get this game but have to say now i have got into it im glad i did. the content is a bit thin but there is lots of great stuff on steamworks and the internet. if your looking for a realistic combat game this is it recommended.",1
"arma... that is a soldier and one life, lots of helicopters, tanks and other things",1
"simply the best game ever. with all the mods and expansions, i dont see how wanting any other game is possible. i wish i would have bought this before buying dayz to save myself the money.",1
"a grate military simulator, that can be used to play whatever game mode you desire, although it might be a bit cluncky at times. a grate time with a group of friends, and with many groups to choose from - one must fit you, but it is lackluster in singleplayer.",2
"arma 3 beautifully continues the legacy of the arma franchise. at no point in this game did i not stop to take in where i was. altis and stratis, the two maps, are stunning. the main map, altis is very large and just that perspective alone is astounding. if you are playing arma for the first time, i highly recommend playing around with the editor and single player before delving in online. this is not a pick up and play type of game. there are aspects that take some time to get accustomed to and you will not get it your first time playing. i cannot wait to see what modders have to offer in the coming months and years to make this game even better.",1
"its a good game 9/10 stars given by me but yeah give me a couple of secs before i destroy the entire game and have to reinstall it -_- its always me",2
"best milsim on steam, but needs a few mods to really shine",1
"awsome realistic game, much better than cod of bf!",1
"a really fun game, dont play the singel, its fun and all but try to get in a clan, that way you have the most fun (in tactical missions). other then that, there are a lot of fun mods like breaking point, battle royale and wasteland that are really fun. a really good game :d",1
"drastically wicked grapics and gameplay. very teamwork is required in this game which is in my point of view is advanture while i like the way of communication but this game worth is just 40-43 dollars not 60 $ because its too much for this game.",1
"well for starters the game seems like it could be really good. when i first got it about a mouth age i tried it out the frame rate wasnt the best but very playable the i finally decided to trying to learn how to play and load the game up and now im luck to get 10 fps. ive looked around and tried a bunch of different things the i found on different forms but nothing seems to help. i get the same frame rate on low settings as i do on high so really dosnt make sence. its really to bad because this game is exatly what i was looking for. update: i thought i would give it one more try and i hadnt changed anything and now im getting 40 to 60 fps on high settings in single player so hopefully it stays like i have no idea what was wrong before.",1
"its a nice game but its better when you have a good pc i can get up to 30 fps on my lap top on all the setings down of course but thats really good for a lap top especially for a game that took me 8 hours to install",1
"undescribably amazing, the best experience of any pc game, in my opinion. this military simulator can be turned into virtually everything, through addons, and simple mission scripting.",4
"the only game where i had a un press team try to interview me in the middle of a firefight about the war in altis.",2
"amazing with stunning visuals with strong community mod support.",1
"i tried to go down a slide. biggest mistake i ever made. thankfully there was a kind doctor nearby who saved my life from the evil creature that was the slide. notify the government, slides are lethal. and to think we let children play on them. science has gone too far i say! 10/10 for kind doctors who understand the dangers of slides.",1
"this game is very tactical and makes you think strategically, the community is great and the game has almost anything you could want in a military simulator, from community made content to extremely detailed maps and weapons. 9/10",1
"i purchased this for the epoch mod and only play for that, the mechanics are fantastic and the graphics are incredible. although the game and mod have a ways to go yet, still much fun to be had. worth every penny... highly recommend.",2
"very enjoyible game and just like its predesenders there is a lot more beyond just the arma 3 game and servers itself so many cool and interactive mods that you couldnt possibily do everything.",1
"arma 3 - awesome military simulator pros - team focused gameplay (serious milsm) -casual style gameplay (wasteland) -runs smoothly - very nice community negitive - bit buggy - engine not the greatest but does the job - fps issues for multiplayer i would reccommend having a mid - high level gaming pc to run this game it is very cpu intensive. 8/10",4

"its a great game if you can overlook the bugs and the desync... i would recomend hopping into a atlis life server then go and make some in game money and make some new friends and have fun! its a really realistic game but ill have to give it 8.27/10 only because its buggy :( but if you overlook the bugs its 9.75/10 on my books!",1

"arma 3, and absolute major achivement by bohemia interactive! i am glad to say that this game has been my favourite game for quite some time and i strongly advise you to purchase this product if you havet already. buying the digital deluxe edition of this game gave me all the arma 3 game music which i thought was pretty cool considering the music is high def.",2
"i like this game, a lot...but im very concerned of why bohemia wants to keep adding stuff in this game instead of working on the optimization for multiplayer, i get about 40 fps in campaign on very high settings, but when i go into multiplayer...the fps bomb drops. ive tried working on the coding to boost the game but nothing works. i hope its fixed",1
"i personally love this game, if you are into realistic first-third person shooters this is for you. i have played all of the armas and i believe this is the best one yet letting you scuba dive for a few missions, fly in the many aircrafts this game offers, and drive in tanks and other amazing vehichles. this game also has amazing graphics along with the sky actually changing its appearence randomly throughout missions to give it a more realistic effect.",1
"cant play more than 5 minutes without a dxgi_device_removed_error displaying, a problem that is shared by many users. there is no clear solution to the problem on any forum and bohemia have basically said it isnt their problem. i have tried everything from re-installing to rolling back drivers, updating and lowering graphics. be very wary, i spent 39.99 on it and due to steams policy, i wont be getting it back!",1
"very fun and addictive game, pretty low fps and the desync issues are pretty drastic, but you start to get used to it and forgive the problems in the engine. i guarantee you will lose your sense of time once you get into it. 8/10",2

"awesome game, great content, brilliant graphics! would highly recommend this to anyone.",3
"excellant combat simulator. this is not a cod/bf type game, it is a simulator of real life combat operations, you can die from one round etc. if you want as close to a real war experience as possible without real bullets flying at you this is your game. perform as infantry, helo pilots, fixed wing pilots, tank crewmembers etc and work with your squad to achieve victory. very well done game, lots of mods and community content, definitely worth the money.",1
"bought the game to use up a 50 dollar steam card. i have yet to test the game on my desktop rig once the gtx560 gets installed, but im playing it on an alienware m11x r2 with a gt335m/intel i7 duo. game runs great on normal settings on my alienware, although this game has terrible xbox controller integration. the game doesnt seem like its worth the 60 dollars so far, im kicking myself for not getting counter strike go and some l4d games. oh well, thats just my two cents.",1
"imagine this: youre sprinting. under heavy fire. trees look like turds. sand looks like a solid block of chocolate. clouds are disabled because your computer cant render them. oh baby, and those shadows...that you have to turn off because your game will crash. you lay prone and pull out your sidearm. suddenly! the frames skip. the game lags. you are shot and killed by a sweaty greasy 40 year old man. your game crashes. you came all over your pc. 11/10 much lag very death such unfair p.s. still is amazing",1
"most fun way to ignore real life with a real life combat simulator. 10/10 would be anti-social again",1
"if you like running with rifles, try this game out, because the titles might as well be the same! in all seriousness the game is very fun, giving an extreme difference to the modern approach to realistic combat. while it is not entirely spot on and the multiplayer is a bit poorly optomized the game definately gives a different taste to bring back life into a growing stale genre.",1
"arma does what no other game can, it brings you two huge maps and allows you to create the content you desire for it. it is not easy to master but very fun while trying. ofcourse as is in all multiplayer games (or should be) this cant be achieved without friends. if you have friends who play (or would like to play) this absolutly is a must have game.",1
"glitchy. its been out for a long time and i finally got it but im not into it at all. love flying helicopters but maybe 20 minutes or so in, the flight stick is suddenly unrecognized and i have to restart. its infuriating. added to a whole other mess of glitches and lackluster multiplayer (for me anyway) and frustrating single player. ill rate it a meh. ill be hated for it, but thats okay.",1
"arma 3 is a great game and a lot of time and effort has gone into the graphics and to make it a game that you will never get bored off or fed up with.",2
"true to the series, a real improvement, unlike many other franchises. would buy again :)",2
"simulation isnt the defining aspect of arma. its scale. the enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish bohemia interactives flagship franchise. its what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an fps. its what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. its what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot. the scale of arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including arma 2. altis, a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. its a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but whats more significant is that armas landscape finally has the technology it deserves.",2
"game is all well and good. but i really hate the fact that they put the game this far in the future! the weapons are absolute crap! im shocked that they didnt just say to hell with it and give you ing lazer guns. i love the addition of scuba options and implementing body armor and customizing your own outfit and the campaign is interesting plus voice acting is much better than arma 2. id give this a 6 out of 10 because i am not happy that i am gonna have to download a  load of mods to play the game with equipment and vehicles that should of been implemented in the first place.",1
"its just so great to play, havent been playing on my computer cause i cant play it on this one... but ive been playing it on my friends pc and it ran fine, just play and youll see that is fun. realistic is one of the things that is well made in this game to, man i liked it since i saw the first trailer",1
"its just amazing episaly with mods but the base game is amzing as it is the only one i botherd to complete plus the editor is really good for creating missions",1
"this one extremely good and detailed game :) i liked it a lot",1
"realy good game, lots of gamemodes and lots of rp servers. the downside of the game is that it has fps problems, but some times it not the game but the gamemode if you play a 70 player rp server then yeah the fps sucks but if you play a deathmatch with 20 player (like battle royal,its a mod ) its not that bad. and it has a lot of nice workshop content. 10/10 would like to kill some one again !",3
"this game is amazing, and the mods make it so much better. if you are a fan of simulators (not like cod), please get this game now!",2
"most realistic fps you can find, although its a lot more fun when you have people to play with.",1
"very buggy, but beautiful, tactical, realistic, adrenaline intense action, many weapons, cars, helicopters, boats, airplanes. one of the best simulators with big landscapes (open world) with many places to hide and plan advanced ambushes. enjoy!",5
"if you like long awkward clunky yet somehow amazingly fun combat and keybinding that makes you want to shove a potato in your grandmas windpipe then yes this is a good game...... i guess 10/10 would play again",1
"despite my logged time, ive never played arma iii. all time is logged playing breaking point. it seems the more the devs improve the mod, the more it becomes pretty awful. worth playing anyway.",1
"buggy as all other bohemian games, also very resourse consuming. however, you can have a good time once you figure all the things out.",1
"coming from the guys who made arma 2 and became well known because of the dayz mod, you could expect another dads game with guns and realism... it has dlcs and all the stuff that the cool kids have these days. tenouttaten/10",1
"i strongly recommend getting this game to anyone that has a good pc and enjoys the likes of battlefield and maybe call of duty and anyone that has previously owned a amra game",2
"the mods for this game are awesome. altis life and battle royal are great fun.",1
"the best ing warfare simulator you will play in your life, with seriously addictive mods and multiplayer gamemodes. bow down to the king of military sandboxes. 10/10",1
"decided out of the blue to finally buy... did not regret, only a few hours on a multiplayer koth and i enjoyed myself. great game like arma2 and oa was plus more features, cant wait to see dayz mod here. furthermore im running on a laptop, preformed well enough",2
"this game is broken!!!!! rip off report!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! just bought the game and cant play multi player for more then 2-5 min before it crashes to desktop. my computer is more then capable of running this broken game and checking on the forums theres 100s of people with the same issue and no responce from bohemia interactive! i could have pissed on the $60 i spent for this game and had less frustration. buyer beware this game is broken!!!! buy at your own risk!!!!!!",1
"this games interface is horrible it is not intuitive or natural by any means. would have loved it if the interface was more like battle field 4. also the game feels very choppy and i am not referring to frame rate. i guess you either love this or hate it do not think this is anything like any other shooter game. i am sure the game will appeal to fans of the previous releases but at this stage i feel like i wasted my money",1
"great game to play with friends , interesting mods . 8/10",1
"not a very good game, impossible to find a legitimate game online.",1
"i love the game, awsome map, great textures the hard thing is get used to the control",1
"this is a great game for anyone with experience with first person shooters. you might not want to buy this as your first fps game becasue of the steep learning curve and the amount if controls. but after some time it becomes a lot of fun. i have had a lot of good experiences in this game that i dont think i could get from another fps. it has many cool features that you just cant get from other games, like for example the ability to make use of any vehichle around you and use that as an advantage in the field. or maybe get a laser deignator off an enemy body and use that to mark targets for your friends. there is even gamemodes for roleplay. like altis life, and arma 3 life which can be fun if you like to roleplay with other people. i think the possibilities in this game are endless. you can make your own missions and submit them to the workshop for other people to download and rate, etc. i have had more than 500 hrs in this game and i think every one was a lot of fun. 10/10",3
"buy one game and thanks to the countless mods, you get several different games. best video game purchase i ever made.",2
"its the greatest game i ever seen in my whole life",1
"i find this a really fun game u can play many game modes like arma 3 life arma 3 takistan life arma 3 city life... i think this is a really good game for people who are starting pc",1
"this is a good game of realism of wars which make sense over a realistic view this game is a have to buy, great community groups, good gameplay",3
"and were running, and were running, and were running, and were running. running. walking. running some more. a little more running. alot more running. is good track simulator. strong, like bear.",1
"awesome campaign,awesome coop,awesome graphics,awesome gameplay aaaaaand battleroyale. everything i waited from this game. 11/10",1
"very fun :d i like it more than arma 2 mostly because there is swimming underwater :3",2
"coming from games like battlefield/counter-strike this was a nice change. theres a lot of little things to get used to, i.e. theres like 10 different stances all that can lean left/right. the ballistics are simulated and pretty well done aside from velocities of some guns. plenty of vehicles/aircraft to get the job done and offer a challenge, even though the flight models are still somewhat arcadeish/linear. the scale of the maps is just crazy, although everything kinda looks the same, its all laid out very believably. theres a few game modes for mp that are worth giving a try, mainly king of the hill/wasteland and i guess altis life but i havent tried it more than 10 minutes. one thing though, in mp games theres not much you can do fps wise when theres >60 players, you will get <25 fps in cities, it doesnt even matter how good your computer is. the sp campaign is good but the controls for ai still need a lot of work and more often than not they just die without following orders. the developers are constantly updating this game everyday with frequent patches so with that id give a rating of 8/10 at $60",2
"one word, amazing. i dont recommend games much but this is definatly one i would recommend.",3
"an amazing games that will entertain you for a while, and the mods make the content on this game endless.",1
"closest thing you can get to being in the military without being there irl, needs more polish though.",1
"its nothing but a thoroughly boring call of duty clone. and by that, think call of duty only more sluggish, lesser-quality graphics, a tutorial that drags on and on, and a weapons customization system ripped straight from battlefield. i got this game for free and i want a refund on my time wasted playing it.",1
"tang harlem whiskey yankee mike they even have my tactical vest in this game  the government dorner 4 lyfe lol :d 10/10?",1
"i have been looking for a game like arma 3 since i started with shooters. i always thought call of duty, or battlefield 3/4 was the most simulated you could get without really going to war. this game is war. this simulator requires players to really try, it is not a run and gun game, you do that, you die. you need to be tactical, aware of your surrondings, and be prepared for anything, from a fireteam of men, to a sniper team, to tanks sitting on the hilll line. everything about this game is amazing. grapihc are awesome, if you can run them on normal or higher, the ai, and ragdolling could use some work. one con of this game is the ai, sometimes there smart, sometimes there dumb. they can get hit with a grenade at point blank range, break there legs, lay down and bandage, then get up and run away. over all, 20/10, would recommend to anyone who wants a good shooting simulator.",4
"great game, tons of mods to choose from so ur sure to find something u like, wether its big battlefield style combat, or trying to run guns and drugs across the border, and of course zombies. great graphics, runs very well, nice and smooth, and brings a level of realism to shooters that is not seen elsewhere.",4
"you need to play with a big group. wasteland and life servers are trash. just play the damn game.",3
"such a good game. it appeals to simulation fans like myself even just for the kill",1
"even though i only get 15 fps in a city/town and 30 fps in the countryside on this game, i still think it is one of the best games i have played. it still has some work to be done to it but thats just what the series is like, a bit glitchy. some of the good points are 290km map with no limits, its a sandbox so you can do whatever the hell you want and a quite good campaign (well, thats what i think). some of the bad points are that it is quite boring for some people. it can run pretty well on pcs without having a very good graphics card. (i have a amd radeon 7730m 2gb graphics card and a i7 core in a laptop and i can run the game!) this is one of my favorite games from one of my favorite series and i am glad i brought it. 9/10 if you like sort-of realistic first person shooters, then i would recomend you get this game.",2
"most realistic shooter played. everything gets you killed including doing nothing. zombie mod is great too. not a casual game, very intense experience when your not running around. combat is quick usually ending within minutes with little or no room for error. you will need a good graphics card to play this game effectively. low graphic settings will comprimise your gaming experience. there are bugs and it is not perfect nor does it run as smooth (on older machines) as bf or cod; but it is an amazing game and i recommend it. 9/10",1

"great....but the for online if you wanted to do anything besides....grunt work then you need teamspeak or the server admins will rage bann you...all of them....",2
"i mean i havent seen any zombies but its a pretty ok game",1
"i couldnt reccommend this game anymore if i tried. it is very fun, very replayable, and intense at times. the zeus addition to the real time editing of scenarios has made this so much better tahn arma 2 its practically silly. the modding community is as good as it has always been maybe even better. there is plenty of servers and people to play with etc... go buy it!! nowwwww!!! :p",1
"you will have to look far for a bether modern military shooter, if you can get over the bad interaction menu",1
"its a great game, but its not for anyone. if you are not an enthusiast of this type of games, you might just leave the game and never play it. but if you like it, you will find great fun playing, expecially with friends.",4
"this game is one of the rare game that has always something new, the community is big and has a lot of modders. you will always find something to do, but i warn you it doesnt run smoothly often and for me this is the only problem. i hope you will consider buying it if you are looking to play for tones of hours and fun! see you on arma!",3
"after the recent update most of the desync was gone, marvelous work. 10/10 would crash the vehicles again.",4
"welcome to the best military simulator of all time, how??? i here you ask. because unlike cod and bf4 you dont sponge a bullet to the face!!!!!!!",1
"do you really need my studip review to buy this game? just.. look at the screensots. 11/10",1
"great game, it has amazing greats, brilliant realism, awesome playability.... problem though.... the community. as with any online game there are always people there to cuss or spam music and with no rap or vote procedure to kick such people off you are forced to join another server. it seems there will never be a screening process to keep scumbag trolls away from team based online games such as arma 3. all in all... good buy and i recommend it to anyone wanting an indepth war simulation.",1
"highly polished arma ii with future weapons, new shooting stances, and vast detailed maps. like its predecessor the mod community makes for a highly customizable game experience now backed by steam workshop. warning: some dedicated fan boys of the arma franchise would claim this is a very smooth game, i feel while smoother than arma ii its still a far cry from being entirely smoothed out. the most popular game mode seems to be wasteland which is dayz with out zombies. as you can imagine new players often get camped and ed prior to even finding a weapon. supposedely you can port arma ii objects into arma iii, i have not tested this yet, but that proves to be some what promising for custom map design.",1
"very fun to play whit friends and whitout friends still fun. its good grapichs but if you have an  pc dont get it. its some really fun mods and so many mods you can play so it never gets boring.",2

"probably the best game i have played so far in my life. futuristic feel to the game is a small minus. (story is set to 2035 i guess)",1
"ive always enjoyed the arma series, the tactical gameplay, strategic planning of things. bis outdid themselves on this one and i cant wait to see more of what they bring. note to self: dont forget to bring ammo into the field, this is like the 4th time ive done this.",1
"why is your ing game broken??!! i try to install and it just deletes itself..",1
"great game fun playing with friends and just having fun",2
"i havent been scared in a game in about 15 years, playing breaking point gave me the biggest scare and biggest adrenaline rush i have ever had in gaming,  yeah, this game is awesome.",1
"great game with amazing gamemodes! fun with friends and single. i bought this game and never had regrets. fun, thrilling & worth it!",1
"one of the best shooter simulators out there with intense gameplay, great map and amazing graphics",1
"this game is something unique and special pros: -modding community makes aditional content almost infinate. (there are some mods in development that look very promissing, im looking at you dayz epoch for arma 3) -massive map to explore -scenarion editor makes almost any imganinable scenario possible -extremely relistic (this could be a con to some) -graphically impressive for its size -massive longevity considering both the mod availiability and the scenario editor -very detailed environment cons -buggy, like very buggy, like has the potenial to ruin your day buggy -very steep learning curve, prepare to spend the first few in game hours learning how to move let along fly, drive, command a squad etc... -so buggy it deserve two mentions. -poorly optimized. no matter what setting i use i cannot run anything over high and even that ryns at 30fps. dont even both if you have a low end pc. overall this game has things to offer that no other game does but it suffers because of an engine that is difficulty for any pc to run. i fully recomend but understand if you pass it over because it looks so intimidating.",1
"ive put in numerous hours on this game across a couple accounts. i wasnt sure if i would stay interested long enough to buy it myself, but wow was i wrong. the replayability in this game, number of great mission and mod makers, and continued development by bomhemia is impressive. this game is immensely better with friends or a small group with so many co-op and team based missions. then you have in-depth role-play in multiple life servers and other great options.",4
"great game. great successor of the previous one. a must have for every military enthusiast!",1
"ok, this game is a huge upgrade from arma 2, graphics were inhanced, gameplay was made better, when talking to teammates the guy doesnt sound like a robot anymore(especially when accouncing grid locations) and overall its just waaaaaaaay better . but, theres one thing that bothers me, the explosions. in arma 2 the explosions were majestic, they had vibrant colours and the colours were sharp. i used to place a tank and then make a jet destroy the tank just so i could see the explosion, or i would fly in a helicopter and shoot rockets, but in arma 3 the explosions look so unpowerful and the colour is dull, theres nothing going on, it doesnt feel or look like a real explosion(apart from the debris flying). arma 2s explosions looked alot better. that for me is the only down-side, the ai was also improved alot.",1
"10 -10 full paced action packed real good graphics military simulation deffinatly would recommed for people to play :)",4
"this game is definately not your standard cod run and gun type of game. you are forced to use tactics and the enviroment around you to gain the advantage and with all the multiplayer content as well as custom missions/mods you will never get bored.",1
"this game is great for a realistic fps/thirdperson shooter,with the new zues mode it makes it fun for all players to play multiplayer just like d&d xd",3
"after 200 hours into this game and playing in the aplha i would still reccomend arma 2 there isnt as much in arma 3 as its counterpart way more items in arma 2",3
"it cant run properly but arma 2 is optimised to do it, if the devs would put better optimisations on it would be a thumbs up",1
"9/10 this is the best and the most realistic war game out there and i love it! playing with friends i have had a super fun experience... this time bohemia you have really outdone yourself....altough there is a few problems im bothered with... for example the low fps and the unrealistic physics like tipping over a heli makes it explode and crashing in to the sea with a plane gets you killed...",1
"i liked this game.. until battleeye gave me a global ban just because i used cheatengine to change a number in single player for giving me equipment. that result is a global ban. is this fair? i do not think so.",1
"only buy this game if ur pc is from 2013 otherwise not worth it.. well singleplayer its nice but if u dont like singleplayer and only play multiplayer like me and u have a older pc dont buy this.. the fps is horrible online to matter what server u play on. for example: my pc is 4 years old. high setting in single player =70 fps witch is awesome. multiplayer on lowest of the lowest settings = 10 fps max just bare this in mind. thank you for reading. p.s when i get a better pc i play the crap out of this :d",1
"imagine a game that was completed by the developers. who routinely worked to upkeep, maintain and fix any lingering issues. this is not that game. 2 years in the making and it feels just like dayz alpha. incomplete, bug filled and constant dlcs that you can buy but dont expect anything to be fixed or working in any of it. waste of money and time.",1
"best military simulator without any doubt! and also a big modding community! 10/10",1
"for those who have played arma series, are passionate with military sims or are enjoying the lengthy(but worthwhile) process of winning, this is the game id recommend. although flight is not as good as the dcs, arma is a well-made simulator(thats right, it is not an arcade game)that simulates all sorts of experiences soldiers do during their line of duty. even if you dont mind your incompetent ai partners/subordinates, sp can be daunting; ai foes are definitely, even ridiculously, smart so you can be shot dead even if you make every precautions to prevent.(too bad our partners are not as smart). every variables must be accounted for executing a simple task. for those who just wanna play this game in a casual way, id really like to remind you this: you cannot be rambo, master chief, or cods protagonist or whatsoever to be winners, in arma. you are much more vulnerable than any of those mentioned heroes. you are in a virtual battlefield, you cannot beat foes unless they are really incompetent, un-coordinated bunches. regardlessly, for those who really want to experience what being a soldier feels like, id recommend this game. life is never easy, neither is this game.",1
"its arma. if youre even thinking about getting it, get it. it is that good. sure there are a few bugs but overall, they hit this one out of the freakin park.",1
"game is boring as  if you dont have friends.youll die repeatdly and just get frustrated,eventually realising you wasted 6 hours when you could play something good like dayz. dont buy unless you have friends. and a good pc i get 13fps and im fine but ive never played a game any higher so it goes to personal preferance.",1
"sp or anything that isnt a mod is a no go, wish i could have given my cash to a few mod devs instead! if you do have it you should definately get the breaking point mod, plays better than the rest of the game. *update as of 1/13/15* still a better flight sim than a tactical shooter by far...",3
"best shooter ever. would take this over cod any day.",1
"i was knocked out by a 6 y/o with a vector 45. smg while he was attempting grand theft auto. 10/10",2
"a great game that focuses or reality and tactical thinking. a refreshing break from call of duty and battlefield.",3
"arma 3 is a military simulator. its not supposed to be played like call of duty or battlefield where you run and gun, but you most certainly can. it helps to play this game with other people, because the ai isn;t very helpful. there is also the problem with bugs that come with any arma game. you will break your legs from running around, you will get trapped in the world, and you will get stuck doing simple actions; you will also love every minute of it. when you learn how to deal with these issues, the game is an absolute blast.the draw of the game isnt the base game, it is the mods. just like arma 2, this game will have a long lifespan because of mods like arma life, epoch, battle royale, breaking point... just to name a few. just be sure before to watch some videos or read the instructions on various websites before you mod the game so that you dont have to reinstall your game or spend hours trying to figure out what you did wrong. 9/10 would fly a helicopter into a tank again, bring a friend, but please fix the annoying bugs.",1
"so far, the downside will be the fatigue system. the upside is great gameplay, decent online community, immersive story, and should the game seem thin or lacking, mod support! mods that can be activated in the arma 3 launcher, which means you can activate which mods you want and leave a few idle. i highly recommend this game, it is a must have for military gamers!",3
"very cool game, love the campaign and the mods avaialble are limitless.",1
"inredible, a master piece. the military sandbox exceded my expectations, better than its predecesors, arma 3 is as realistic as it gets,with the all setting at ultra, you almost feel as if you were driving the m1a1 or just chillin with your soldiers. just one down feature, the terrain (the grass, rocks, gravel, etc), the detail of it is not the best, but overall i highly recomend it",1
"got in a chopper so pilot fly team to the lz , got crashed by the same damn chopper and pilot 10 times a in row , then i gave up on the game and went to play epoch , got bashed in face for clothes , then i decided delete the game , but then i just realized , isnt these things what makes arma way more different than other shooters ? would die again before doing anything again 10/10 .",1
"life-like graphics and immersion would give any veteran ptsd. this game will turn anyone into a adrenaline junky instantly. the realistic gameplay and balistics are punishing, but at the same time very rewarding. this third installment of bohemias army simulator set in the near future on an existing island offers tactical gameplay and is enjoyed best playing in a squad. although lone wolfing can be done your survival chances will be smaller. the base game includes access to multiplayer mods like battle royal, wastelands, king of the hill, altis life and breaking point. high replayability value and a mission editor for those who like scripting all makes arma3 worth your money. requires a mid-high end pc to run properly. the gameplay can be slow. some mods dont run as well as others and suffer from desync. it has a few bugs and glitches, though nothing game breaking ive experienced so far. the movement can feel clunky and the controls/keybindings may take a while getting used to as there are just so many. i would reccomend arma3 to anyone who enjoys a serious militairy simulator.",1
"wonderful game with several nice mods. has a slight learning curve, but definately worth a purchase.",1
"arma 3 is a brutally hard military sim, its not your regular first person shooter. this is the platform the military uses to train soldiers because the guns and cover systems are so realistic. the ai is unforgiving, and if you take even one bullet you are in a world of trouble, you get wet or in the cold without the right clothing your going to freeze to death, take too much of a fall your going to break your legs. you also are not a 1 man army toting around an armarda of weapons, you take a side arm and a main weapon with a small ammount of ammo, if you have a pack maybe you can fit a spare smaller gun, and a few more rounds. but the main story is not why most people buy this game, arma is a modders wet dream, there is a ton of modded game modes, the 3 majors ones being; arma 3 epoch altis life arma 3 sandbox. there are also a good many more in development. the game is a little pricey, but it does go on sale fairly regularly, but if you have a few friends and find a mod you like you have a game that will keep you entertained for a long long time.",1
"best mmo (kind of works in this context) ive ever played. 9/10 - limegn",2
"epic game with awesome graphics. best arma multiplayer yet.",2
"feels more real than any other army sim game ive played",1
"a very thrilling, action packed military simulator. this is definatly an improvment over the past games, highly recomended.",2
"totaly worth the money there are many things u can do and even good things to do in single player i strongly recommend this game to people who like the realistic type of shooters",1
"this game is great, especially with friends, breaking point also adds so much to this already amazing game! :d",2
"i dont like warfare in this game. sounds wierd right? well i prefer the altis life!",1
"why play these games when you could be playing custers revenge",1
"when i was a child, i spake as a child, i understood as a child, i thought as a child: but when i became a man, i put away childish things and played arma iii.",2
"great game overall with a great modding community!",1
"i have over 300 hours plus into this game and i have to say it just might be one of my favorite pc games of all time. i highly recommend if you like mass online game play and military simulations.",2
"this game is great. if you say its bad........ i will cut you",3
"brilliant game, graphics a1, audio a1, gameplay perfection, couldnt possibley be a better combat game currnetly on the market",2
"great game! its everything great that arma 2 had & then some! another added bonus being that despite dayz standalone launching dayz mod development is in full force & now there are arma 3 dayz mods. all the pretty graphics, physics etc. that make standalone great plus all of the content that made the dayz mods great! the campaign is amazing, the multiplayer is amazing (zues now allows in game editing in multiplayer so a gm figure can change a mission for those playing on the fly). arma 3 is simply great! it has its bugs, but those are to be expected from a studio as small as bohemia & theyre rather quick about fixing them too. i cant rave enough about this game!",2
"if you love military simulators or just plain out love the military this game is by far the best out of any other game to play. i have played arma 2 and oa and ever since arma 3 came out i have not touched arma 2 or oa. this game has a learning curve but ask people in multiplayer or play the campaign for help. overall 10/10.",1
"this game is great fun to play with friends but warning to some with low-spec pcs this is a really damanding game but is worth it!",1
"i had a lot of fun playing it with my friends, looking forward for arma iv ;)",3
"it could use some more content and an introduction to modding without having to go through endless forum threads, but its a pretty solid game... probably the most fun game ive ever played. once you get past the learning curve, its really an amazing experience.",2
"still a better fps than cod but thats not hard to make it better than cod anymore is it? only played a little bit of this game but i love it! the game is so enjoyable, i wasnt a big fan of arma at first but once i started playing this i just fell in love with the game! people moan and complain that this game is to realistic but how can a game be to realistic!? would definitely recommend this game, i probably wouldnt pay 36 for this but for the 24 i payed when it was a sale i thought that was a bargain, ive played just under and hour of arma 3 and after that hour i have fallen in love with it! arma 3 is great playing on your own and is even better when you play with friends!",1
"this is the finest and most intense military simulation you could get !!!! the community around is so expended and there are thousands of mods to custom the game to your liking !! i recommend highly !!!",1
"arma 3 is a fun game to play with friends if you dont have anyone to play with its not gunna be that fun but its a great game but only one thing i dont get why did they have to make the controlles so weird i mean why but besides that its a great game",1
"most glitchy game ever to be released. half the time it doesnt work and the oher half it keeps crashing. im at that point i want to uninstall it and i have only been playing for the last 4 hours that was after trying for 2 hours to get it working.",1
"the most strategic f.p.s game i have ever played. i love the game because it is filled with hard campain missions and an amazing multiplayer",1
"got spawn killed by a man with a handgun, then he hunt me down just to take my clothes and dignity. 10/10 would play again",1
"too much bug, crash error, and still no respond from the developer buy this game only if you can endure the  engine",1
"not much i can say one of the best games i have played",1
"military helmet cam combat footage simulator kill / be killed",1
"i run it at the lowest settings and get 8 fps but its still fun",1
"this is a game where you shoot things and they die. almost like real life. except its not real life.",2
"if you have an intel cpu you will love this game and its multiplayer. if you have an amd cpu the single player will run fine but you will be unable to play on any servers due to very low framerates.",1
"very nice game lots of weapons maps based in greek islands but if you dont have a friend to play with dont buy it and also very nice edditor mode where you can make yor own missions",1
"amazing game, plan on playing for hours at a time.",1
"can be much better........great ideas.............needs much improvement..............ah yea the ai........little joksters they are.......they just dont like dieing.............",2
"i recommend playing dayz first, as the community taught me all the tips and tricks about playing arma or an arma based mod. when i first picked up arma 3, even after staring at the config screen, i was still confused and got stuck repeatedly. with dayz it kinda progresses you from how to change from first person to third, shooting, then figuring out how far your target is away so you can compensate for it. arma doesnt really teach you that right away, thats way i was lost. also, the campaign in arma (what ive played of it) is pretty cool, aswell as the multiplayer, but its big hitter is definetly the mods. battle royal, atlas life, theyre all great and super fun, as well as the community. i definetly recommend you get this game as there are endless posibilities.",1
"if youre looking for a game thats both realistic and fun at the same time then this is the game for you.",2
"awesome game!!!!!! love it... always fun, never lets me down.",1
"likes.........out on patrol, focused on the mission. the filling of the pants as a round cracks passed your ear. you hit the ground wondering where the hell that came from......get the picture. this game has it all, ships planes, choppers and for the cod player tanks and apcs. sure it has a few bugs but once you are in the game just waiting for that round with your name on it......... by the way i was in the army for 18 years and have heard the one that just missed dis-likes..........waiting for that round :)",2
"if arma 4 does not come out, i will slit your mother.",1
"singleplayer not as fun, very hard. endless multiplayer hours of fun. highly recommended, totally worth $60, snatch it up once it goes on sale for $30",5
"even better with the steam workshop addons. highly reccommend.",1
"bohemia did somthing right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love you bohemia but dayz fix it.",2
"be a man and play this game quit all other fps nonsense youre up to this is the real deal",1
"easily the best small island simulator ive ever played. loads of trees and flies!!!",1
"its a great game for the player who likes realism, multiplayer, and sandbox games in one deal. by far the best military game ive played. 10/10",3
"needs some tweaking but overall enjoyable military shooter, i like it.",1
"have you ever wanted to be a pychotic blood lusting soldier in a far country slautering people for the hell of it; well you found the game.",2
"absolutely fantastic! as expected, youll need to be into highly realistic gameplay and hardcore military simulating, but if this is your kind of gaming, youll fall in love because of the possibilities.",1
"fun, great community, plenty of mods to keep you entertained but this game is expensive, its a stretch whether its worth 60$ imo but its very fun would buy again if it got cheaper",1
"absolutely love it! this is a must have for anyone into military anything",1
"i think this game is great buy it omg im crying to my mom because she slaps the  out of me please help she wanted me to review this game help",1
"runs smoother then the last, and theres already alot more diverse mods and game modes.",1
"its like arma 2 but it looks better, feels smoother and unlike its predecessor the most overpowered enemy is no longer the menus. i mean jesus christ, the menus in arma 2 fought more than the npcs. but yeah get arma 3.",1
"this game is honestly one of the best military simulators on the market. goes to show how long technology has come when you look at the stunning scenary and high detailed objects and background. if you are looking for a serious hardcore realist military/action simulation, arma 3 is for you.",1
"shoot. kill. die. repeat. 10/10 - could be better",2
"you need to buy an extra 3 cpus and an extra 80 gbs of ram to run this game at low settings 30 fps",1
"arma 3 was a huge upgrade from arma 2. the graphics engine, and introduction of physx on vehicles just blew my mind. i was a bit unhappy due to the lack of vehicles when compared to arma 2, however... the rest was absolutely brilliant.",2
"arma 3 offers you multiple sandbox multiplayer missions and variety of large scale battle scenarios. bullet travel and weapon ballistics are quite reallistic so its not your standart battlefield game. big maps and large game modding community make this game really specia. 11/10 would play.",3
"one of my favorite games of all time you can build bases play campaign multiplayer all that good stuff i recommend!",2
"awesome game! i dont play arma though, i play the mod breaking point! its great!",1
"i have a good gaming computer and still seem to lag very bad on the lowest settings. other then the below 30 frame lag and the bugs that are very annoying it has a nice play style and i highly recomend it. if the performance was increased and fixed it would i bet be a much more popular game. 7/10",1
"totally worth it. but i will wait for the price drop again. untill then arma 2 :)",1
"awesome graphics. amazing storyline. really good mechs. maybe if u guys put the work into it and make it for consoles u guys will probs make more money.",1
"one of the most realistic games i ever played, and i played...",1
"really good game. if you prefer a realistic, slow phased fps game with a real feel of war this is the game for you. insanely large map and plenty of different gamemodes to choose from. there is also a nice rp server hosted by killernetworkgaming.co.uk where you can be a civilian or cop - choose to do real work or crime. the possibilities of this game and its mods are endless. looking forward for  dayz  mod also. my recommendations!",1
"well , i bought this game on the first alpha days , when it was 32.99$. i really like strategy (hope i wrote it right) and simulator games & fps games. this game contains many objects and many ways to play , the vanilla has no many weapons nor cars and aircrafts , but , there is a big but , you can use the workshop on steam to use maps  missions  other mods to make your playing much more funny and realistic. if you consider spend around 40 - 50$ when its on sale , do that , on this game of course.",1
"best game ive ever played it had so much content!!!!!",1
"best game ever! needs some minor tweaks and i could recommend a few additional things that would make the game even better but if youre reading this section to find out whether it is worth buying --- i can honestly confirm that if you have a beaty enough pc this game is great!",2
"absolutely incredible warfare simulation. this is by far the best war game i have ever played.",3
"heading the same way as ea. dlc hungry company. its horrible thing to exclude things from a game to later include in a dlc, but then remove stuff from an already launched to put into a dlc....you guys have lost sight of putting out a game for people to just enjoy. money talks to you now.",2
"this is what the military games should be!!! the best game i ever had. recommended: 10/10 make arma not war respect from hellas and from my friends!!! please i would like to ask you to put the hellenic flag in the game i love my country i love this game!!! we are waiting for more you are the best!!!!!",3
"bring your friends, and take down these bandits! coop in core of its meaning.",1
"a fantastic game, easy to get into, difficult to master. best tactical combat game out there, bar none.",1
"very qwirky physics but good fun for the patient shooter.",1
"the perfect way to play arma 3: 1: get 2 ugvs and a buddy. 2: tell your buddy to get into the first ugv while you get into the second. 3: control the ugv that your buddy was in while you have him control yours. 4: drive around like idiots",3
"as soon as i got this game i knew that i was a solilder but then i realised that im a 14 year old boy playing on ym computer.",1
"this is by far the best war game/sim i have ever played/rp. there are so many addons and things too! great job!",2
"60$ for the must unstable game i have ever puchased.",1
"arma 3 is the best game ever! if you have ever played arma 2, you know that running into rocks was the worst! wether in a car or on foot, the fatality rate was always 100%! but wait theres more! if you get arma 3, you can run into all the rocks you want! but be careful, someone decided there was an imbalance and so if you drive into a small chainlink fence, unlike in arma 2, your car has a 75% chance of exploding and a 100% chance of losing its wheels! cant wait for arma 4!",1
"absolutely amazing. i was a little worried about the learning curve and all the action buttions you can use but it honestly took me about 30 hours of playting to understand everything. maps are really fun and this game is surprisingly addictive. the whole dynamic of the game is just mind blowing, the developers p[aid attention to detail. youll find yourself at the edge of your seat smiling and wanting to share some of the crazy stuff that happens in the game with someone because its just so realistic. buy the game and get ready to be submerged into one of the greatest games youll ever play. (i was a peasant who liked to play destiny, halo, battlefield. etc so the learning curve isnt too bad or a chore).",1
"this game is outstanding, especially when on max graphics. its a really beautiful game and a good war simulator.",2
"with immersive maps, beautiful graphics, and an awesomely challenging campaign, this game sounds pretty good already. tie in the fact that it has insanely realistic mechanics, and true to life online combat, and i would personally give this game an 8.5/10.",1
"playing gamemode wasteland: spawned in bought a gun killed everyone at the gun store ran to the water drowned respawned ran across the whole map to get to a money shipment 5 other guys were there i hid behind a rock hey killed all the ai and then i killed them took the 75k ran across the whole map to an atm deposited it blew up a chopper with a minigun boat then i left 1010 would do it again! gg",1
"epic game take your time in learning the controls and gamemodes. many mods and countless hours of fun",4
"love this game wish my computer was good enough to play some of th more fun game modes but even with just being able to play escape altis and altis life(moderatly laggy) this game is on the top of my wish list",1
"take a few friends and play wasteland mode if you want awesomeness !",1
"fun strategy army game, you are basically an one man army. awesome online gameplay and mods i recommend it (6.5/10)",1
"a fantastic millitary sim that never get old with all the differant gameplay styles and the rp servers its deff worth 60$",3
"at last, on the fourth iteration, bohemia interactive deliver an arma game that is not only expansive in scope, but also feels polished and bug free. the graphics are great, and the campaign marks a return to the story-driven excellence of earlier days (after the disappointment of arma ii). of course, as always, its the sandbox element that really makes arma iii shine, and the addition of steam workshop serves only to make this element of the game even greater. this is a game that demands patience and dedication, but it will reward you with the richest, most varied, and possibly best supported military combat experience available on any gaming platform today.",3
"this game is one of the best ive played its got ... let me think cause theres a lot. lots of online game modes map editor realistic things um yea its just fun over all. i recommend this game also yes it does have zuez!!!!",1
"the game is outstanding, the most realistic on foot, on air, and on sea combat simulation. the pace is intense, it rapidly changes through out each course of action you make.",2
"this is a proper military sim, but has a very steep learning curve.",1
"i was a designated marksman overwatch on the rooftops of kunduz, afghanistan while army rangers cleared compounds of insurgents through the main village. so basically the game is outstanding. 11/10 would do way too much walking again.",2
"you can run around naked in a fur hat and shoot things, whats not to like?",1
"the most realistic military experience short of being dropped into a live warzone just got more intense with the go kart addon.",1
"so many things to do, like making your own missions in editor and playing them with other people. also, hours of time looking through mod sites and downloading anything remotely cool is fun too",1
"amazing game best military game i have ever played if you get it you need to play on 23rd servers on coopertive missions its so real and amazing also come join are clan!!!!",5
"there is nothing, i mean nothing like arma. this is really and endless game. the mod community is robust and very active. everything, and anything is possible in arma iii. this is what pc gaming is all about! watch this video for a better example.",1
"the arma series is fantastic in its flexibility and mod support, arma 3 is no exception. the shiny new engine is great, still a bit clunky with a few underlying bugs but definitely a step up from arma 2.",1
"its a very good game though you do need to be pretty good at shooters.",1
"11/10 ruined my entire life. arma will ruin every single military shooter on the planet for you. if you are looking for a game that will completely cut you off from civilization, arma is the game for you!",3
"i wish the controls were easier, but overall great game!!",1
"if youre looking for a great game to give you some adrenaline, then arma 3 is the right choice for you. warning: this game involves massive team work on a large scale, if you like playing alone then this game may be too awesome for you. but other than that, work together to succeed! ( it is singleplayer, but i dont recommend playing alone ). war has never been accurate in a video game like it is in arma 3. instead of run & gun combat, you experience patient and heart pounding moments knowing the fact that if you die in a mission, its a game over. work with your friends to find advantage points to your enemys and call air support if a tank has you under fire. and if you get it in maybe the leg or arm, you can always bandage yourself to avoid bleeding to death. many missions usually last many hours so be sure to have nothing to do during the day and time in your hands. and if arma still feels like its missing something, visit",1
"good -realistic (compared to cod or bf) -fun with friends -tons of gamemodes -good graphics -plenty of mods bad -overpriced dlc -low fps (aka the game is not optimised) -probably too difficult for new players to understand how to play",2
"most realistic arma so far. highly reccomended, especialy since ive put 126 hours into it and dont intend to stop there.",1
"if this game is on sale buy it because i promise youll have fun. 10/10",1
"arma 3 is the latest game made by bohemia interactive. it is absolutly beautifull when on high graphics. lots of possibilties for modding, *cough* arma-holic *cough*. a new mod has surfaced called arma 3 takistan life. its the arma 2 taki life mod ported but it feels better. arma 3 altis life is very good. many servers and lots of fun to be had. as you can see from my hours on this account alone arma 3 is a very enjoyable game. its also a very very good combat simulator. king of the hill is one of the most enjoyable. the new karts dlc is very fun to play with friends and the zeus dlc is brilliant. great for multiplayer missions. get this game 9.5/10. 0.5 - waiting for my battleships ! bohemia. :)",3
"after several months of trying to use this game i have had enough. today the latest update removed all the mods in expansions (with no guidance about how to reinstall them) that made this half completed game playable. despite its huge potential and possibilities, bi have developed and sold a half completed game thats over complex, unintuitive, with poor; single play functions, gameplay and ai command & control, editing and character / vehicle modifications. despite excellent features (virtual arsenal and editor) they are not interconnected but isolated elements requiring complex and out of game processes to bring them together! when was this acceptable? for some reason its set in 2030 (why?) and relies far to heavily on the modding community to make up for its fundamental weaknesses (e.g. bipods for lmg and snipers rifles are an urgent requirement you can not use the weapons effectively (or realistically). but no bohemia interactive priorities go carts over critical game weakness to be addressed, waiting 2 years to have this addressed in the dlc stream, can i ask how i get my money back please?",1
"i bought this game soley for altis life. was skeptical about the $60 price tag on it. but in the end worth it, i have definelty got my moneys worth from the multiplayer alone.",2
"the new update ruined helicopters. total . not sure what kind of  would think the new controls are better.",3
"a serious game with lots of mods, so every gamer will find something for his/her taste. my favourite mode is capture the island with bennys cti mod. lead your squad of soldiers, tanks, aircraft in the battle for territory on a huge and beautiful map. even has epoch, but the old one had better construction options.",3
"very fun game, requires some skill but also a great amount of strategy. lots of fun to play with realism communities as well",1
"i have played so much of this game and i can safely say that its good and bad. its good in the sense that the game functions how it should and sometimes the engine can just be hillariouse, however as a combat simulator it works dreams. if you play this game with your friends taking on ai it can be a blast. dig deeper into the communities though such as altis life (an rpg game mode) and you will find friendship, betrayal liers, honesty, some of the best and some of the worst people you will ever meet. i suppose this is a community review for this game and to sum it all up in one word i would use drama. brilliant game though",5
"it doesnt get any better than this, poss the greatest military shooter of all time, and one of the most diverse mod comminity out there... 11 out of 10",1
"a much better improvement in the way that arma plays and looks, i recommend this game to all arma 2 fans and incourage people whom have never played arma to try it.",1
"its so awsome game love it different senario and its verz realistic",1
"this game isnt like cod or bf now dont get me wrong im a fan of cod but havent played bf,but the thing is that cod isnt that realistic,bf is more realistic but in bf you can jump out of your jet,shoot down an enemy heli and land back in your jet but arma 3 is more realistic and also if you ever want to go into the milatary you mite know what to expect and arma 3 is a very fun game whith an exciting and thrilling experience that gets your blood pumping. all i have to say now is if you realy like realistic fps shooters then this is worth the money.",2
"went to a weed field to gather some cannabis and got arrested by undercover cops. 10/10 would sell weed again.",1
"i highly recommend this game to anyone who really loves fps/third shooters and anyone who loves hardcore combat! there are sstill glitches of course... the multiplayer is awesome. singleplayer is awesome. everything about dlc missions and the dlc packs are awesome! i also recommend this to anyone who loves arma or big open world games!",2
"i still cannot believe that such an amazing and huge game is being created by a team so small. - past me in some interview. a3 is the best military game out there. dont expect and easy win.",4
"what is this  after update all kinds of errors game james ,did you fix sniper mag going from 8 aclip to 1 a clip i guess not you broke the game id say wait 1 but i yell you now you twits",2
"i really enjoy this game .. its very intense but makes you appreciate simulators and fpss.. i have clocked so many hrs into this game that i could have completed real basic training. i recommend you get your friends together for a week of infantry training before you try to break your kill streak record .. this is not call of duty prepare for the real thing..",3
"a worthy sequel to arma 2, but with alot more features and -kickicking.",1
"this game is awesome and you must get it, nuff said!",1
"i think this game is fantastic, and is the best standalone milsim available, but im giving it a negative review only because its poorly optomized and im getting 20 frames on a gtx 770 on all low settings. this only happens on multiplayer, so if youre only looking for the single player experience (you madman) definitely buy this, otherwise, only buy this if you have the pc to back up this games inabilaty to run well. ive played better looking games in 4k resolutions and gotten better frames than this.",1
"very immerse and realistic, and im very excited to see upcoming features.",1
"altis life- stole a helicopter, took a man hostage, landed, got chased by the police, got captured, got charged with grand theft auto, evading police and rekless flying and got put in prison for 10 minutes... 10/10 would take hostage again...",1
"play altis life mod on this, its absolutely brillian. blackwing gaming",1
"this game isnt for everyone. repeat: this game isnt for everyone. in a world where we are plagued by arcade-style military shooters, arma 3 sets out to bring the word simulator back into the muck of current- and next-gen military games. this is not call of duty, this is not battlefield, this is a true to life sim! long-range engagements, long walks/drives/flights to other mission locations, and dangerous consequences if you get hit. oh no, the call of duty player was shot, and all he has to do is wipe raspberry jam from his visor and his wounds are miraculously healed. in arma 3? you get shot, you feel it. you move slower, your vision blurs, and no, it wont just go away with time. you better get a combat medic to patch you up... vehicles run out of fuel, weapons run out of ammo, and the enemy is already out of patience... what will you do on stratis and altis? this is arma 3. the next great military simulator.",1
"i almost feel like steam played a crule joke on me . i payed $40 for the game and it doesnt work arma 3 has the worst fps in history , my pc runs it @ 9 fps . what a joke . do yourself a favor and buy anything else . . .",1
"buy it,play it, love it! if you buy arma 3 you dont buy a single game, you buy a whole bunch of games. choose what you like from altis life(an rpg) over wasteland(military sandbox),king of hill all the way to breaking point(a zombie survival game). if you dont like multiplayer just play the campaign, which got a pretty smart ai and a great story. want more fun after the campaign?just download all the custom mission made by players and play them alone or in coop with some friends. 10/10 would buy again.",1
"this game is action-packed, but filled with humorous moments. great for anyone who likes simulations, fps, and strategy.",2
"im really enjoying arma 3, i suggest and recommend highly!",1
"spawn in to game with two people in front of me. they turn and kill me. 10/10 would be spawn killed again.",1
"a is for amazing, r is for im not really sure, m is for magnificent and a is for amazing again and 3 lastly 3 times the amazingness (true fact...trust me im a doctor)",1
"arma 3 alpha is out and it is really great game i would recommend it to anyone who likes team work and relistic warfare. :)",2
"fun game to play with friends, huge maps. tons to do",2
"this game is is the top military simulation (it is the only one). only problem for this game you must have high end pc standard to high graphic, in cod you will play at max setting. for ultra settings you need at least i7 and 2 gfx cards. i play on standard to ulta setings with 40 - 80 fps. what definitly need a big update and fix is terrain builder and other tools for making maps and mission. for game i give 9/10 need more optimization for editor 5/10 need a lot more work and better setup, guide and documentation... too long learning curve, hard to make decent maps without help from youtube and lots of forums reading and searching.....",1
"if you like beating people to death with dragon  then this is your game",4
"good game, just too buggy, unoptimised, and overpriced",1
"i loved it, i really did but battle eye destroyed my fan with a global ban to the fase after i did nothing",1
"the game as a whole looks really good though even me with a good pc struggles to run it on high settings... getting 20> fps on high.",2
"can be buggy as hell sometimes but theres so many mods to play its worth getting this game. check out: a3 wasteland, breaking point, epoch, overpoch and battle royale just to name a few.",1
"a game that gets your heart going, whether it is in altis life or just some of the mp missions. this game is great.",1
"very good game, just the server listing takes a long time.",1
"10.0 pros: -an insane amount of high quality, super fun, multiplayer mods -simulation style in all aspects -pretty graphics -super customizable from head to toe -once you grasp it, its ing awesome -breaking point (mod) -altis life rpg (mod) cons: -lots of controls to work with -not your average shooter; steep learning curve",1
"fun fun and more fun get a play with me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"cleared a buliding by shooting through it with a .50. would penetrate again.",2
"what the hell battaleye i got a bloody globle ban for what i did use any hack and i got ban for some resone what the hell in going on i use all my money for this and now i got ban for some reson what the hell",1
"i love this game, but i have a screenshaking problem that has persisted over many updates. ive posted in the troubleshooting forum to no avail, and ive looked it up online and tried dozens of troubleshooting processes. nothing has worked. i payed full price for a game i cant play, kinda sucks. r9 280x 6gb, amd fx6300, 8gb ram.",1
"as good as it get for tactical simulation. hours of gameplay, so much fun!",1
"im writing this review because steam wants me to. also arma 3 is awesome.",5
"i would say you guys should get this game as it is quite a fun game to be on with all the different modes from zombies to hunger games. also its a great co-op game aswell",1
"outstanding, my all time favourite military game. its great especially online.",2
"what a great game! zeus is alot of fun and the exspansiveness of the overall game is staggering. i highly recommend it!",1
"after 200 hours into this game and playing in the aplha i would still reccomend arma 2 there isnt as much in arma 3 as its counterpart way more items in arma 2",3
"it is finally out of beta! it combines cod as well as battlefield gameplay together. a must have for both parties... its the link between the battle that is raging on...",3
"the most unique military simulator of 2013-20xx years.",1
"1000/10 one of the best games ive ever played. so realistic. super fun with friends.. just buy it right now... its amazing",1
"arma 3 is a shooter that breaks the arcade fps paradigm, the versatility of this game engine and features presented therin are absolutely unmatched. worthy of the title military simulator completely. fly aircraft, drive vehicles, logistics with team strategy, tact, and disciplin this is the closest to a real combat environment you can get without selling your self to the man. other big title shooters out there have gone the way of the run and gun shoot em up arcade styles and require very little forethought. if you desire an experience that will rock your fiber, and boost your blood pressure all the while training your brain? arma 3 is the game for you!! much recommended for sensible, mature players.",3
"very much like its predecessor, arma 3 has certainly kept alive the milsim theme. absolutely heart pounding silence mixed with adrenaline filled firefights. all in the backdrop and setting of a very beautiful two islands. a must buy!",1
"the best available game for those who seek a reasonable combination of realism and gameplay balance in any first-person game!",2
"the realisim in this game is intense! this always has my heart racing and puts you right there in on the action. love it great job.",1
"massive improvement since the last game which ive been playing for about 4 years.",1
"i love this be nice it was free for one time and i can keep it i really like it so cool so fun to play u guy rock :3",2
"its a good game,bohemia add more options to make the game not too hard to play,better then arma2,but the campaign doesnt work well,for example,at the last mission of survival,the artillery seems like random,so,sometimes i killed by the artillery,i dont think the leader said keep runing,so the artillery cant hit you is right lol :(,but its a really good game",1
"the worlds finest modern warfare simulator. pros: the infantry experience is sublime, with enormous map, beautiful and diverse environments, great freedom of movement and very comprehensive controls. inclusion of combat divers and paratroopers. aircraft, helicopters, wheeled and tracked vehicles and boats work great as instruments for inserting infantry and supporting them. real-world tactics works. great community, including a very comprehensive guide by dslyecxi. trackir is supported. a trackir is highly recommended, and adds enormously to both immersion and situational awareness. singleplayer campaign is competent, but i belive the most fun is to be had with user-created content or in online games with the milsim-crowd. cons: i would prefer contemporary military hardware instead of near-future. controls are optimised for outdoors action, and feels a bit clumsy inside buildings. controls on aircraft and helicopters are extremely simplified compared to dedicated flightsimulators. this is probably a design choice for reasons of accessibility, but the new dlc promises helicopters with more advanced controls. hope this starts a trend of more proper simulation of helicopters and aircraft. highly recommended!",1
"arma 3..... a fun and immersive experience.pros: great graphics, immersive, great editor, awesome mp, and 4 factions to play as, fia nato aaf csat. cons: a few minor balencing issues, and is not optomized to well. 8.3/10",2
"one of the better games i have played. it has a few bugs but when played with a few mods a good group of people the game shows what it s about and just how good it is. 10/10",5
"this is possibly the most realistic and entertaining military simulator ive ever had the joy to play. my absolute favorite part is the flying. the planes and helicopters in this game fly better than any flight simulator ive seen. i have only experienced a fraction of the game, yet im already hooked. creating missions is very fun, but it takes a little bit to get used to the mechanics. i highly recommend this game. 9.99/10",1
"this is an awesome game, good grafic, big maps , great sound effects and very realistic game :-d",3
"a wonderfully satisfying pc game,many game-modes, huge maps, plenty vehicles, awesone weapons, ect. definetly worth the $59.99",2
"very confusing controls makes it difficult to play. definitely not worth 35.99 -_-",1
"i have almost 120 hours in this game and i still dont know half what it got to offer. it is simply the best game of 2013. if you is wondering wether or not to buy the game so buy it. the editor is the best way to experinece all the vehicles. play it as the game is ment to be played and you will enjoy it. if you are an battlefield or cod player dont buy this it is slow phased and you dont get you healt back after 5 seconds so buy it if you like slow phased and realistic games. this is the best way i can describe it. i have to go and play the game",3
"what makes this game an incredible good bang for your buck is the extremely good and dedicated modding community. for me this game is all about the multiplayer. you can get both pvp and some really good coop experiences! i love it :)",2
"this game is great, the simulation on the vehicles is realistic. arma 3 requires a good computer to be able to experience the game. this game has lots of mods such as epoch, breakingpoint etc. this games map is extremely large, the altis map and the stratis map. this is a good thing! however this game costs 35.99 in my opinion it is highly overpriced, it would be a must buy game if the price was between 23.99-30 at the end, this game is great, nice simulation, i highly recommend this game to everyone. if you got the money laying around, you should really get this game.",2
"the sequel to one of the greatest 3rd person war simulators of our time.. still alot of potential in terms of wasteland but an amazingly functional game to play with a large map and a small map.. dare to game with bohemia and you will not be dissappointed.",3
"launch goats to space with huge amounts of explosives. 10/10.",1
"i know most people say this is for only really hardcore gamers and while that may be, im not the most hardcore gamer, but ive had loads of fun playing altis life and several of the other game modes like battle royale. 8/10 would reccomend to most people but the game is pretty unoptimised (atleast in multiplayer)",1
"awesome game. this is hands down the most fun you can play and waste 6 hours without even realizing it.",1
"i...love...this! yes, arma 2 is alot more polished (obviously) but this will use arma 2 to wipe its  when its finished. not only the underwater aspect of the game but the ragdoll physics.....ragdoll physics! if youre a fan of dayz then i recommend a gamemode called wasteland. its quite similar but minus the zombies. you can play on the dayz mod but its really, really, really experimental at the moment.",1
"awesome tactical gameplay, if you enjoy simulations, this is not cod or bf4!!!!",5
"mechanically, arma 3 is outstanding, with controls that are smooth while still portraying the weight of a human body. weapons feel great and firefights remain intense both against ai and other humas. atlis is an impressive map with each square kilometer offering interesting options for firefights. the first two episodes of the campaign are good, and there are some great mods and modes already showing up like breaking point and the universal war sandbox. it also happens to be the best looking open world game around in terms of sheer realism. im genuinely excited to see how this game develops in the coming years.",1
"ive never had as much fun as i have had in this game, i can run around the battlefield in just underwear! altis life is also anothing thing that is awesome. i would recommend this game 10 out of 10 times",2
"i really enjoy this game, its mods and glitches add a whole lot to this game. i personally enjoy arma 3 life the best because of the roleplay and occasional police chases.",1
"this is a great game. no matter what you like: a game to mess around in, running around as chickens or a tactical shooter where teamwork is the key. it is pretty well rounded, any role: if it be a fighter pilot or an infantry soldier, is available for use.",4
"fun f/tps that can be either serious or more arcade-like depending on your playstyle.",1
"too much walking, not enough fighting. good simulation not a good shooter. just m.h.o.",1
"this game is ing hard. 10/10 like skyrim with arma would play again.",1
"not a huge fan of this game, but....i am really liking the breaking point mod for it. is it worth $60 ? not for the game, but for the mod, it could be close. keep an eye out on sales for arma 3, get it then, and immediately download the breaking point mod. much better",1
"if you have friends its a beautiful game if you dont have friends its beatuful game too.. dont compare this game with bf series or cod series its a war simultator. but its not just about war its kind of life simulator . it have s diffrent modes like altislife......",1
"this game where do we start..... well for starts is a good game with alot of game modes by default. king of the hill is probably one of the good ones for solo players or domination if you like teamplay. so this game is by no means bad vanilla but there is a problem, it suffers from the same thing that titanfall does. it lacks content of course there are a plethura of things to do but what the game does on its on really isent enough. that being said this game truely shines with its modabilatiy and is best played with mods as they improve the gameplay alot. so overall its a good game and i would buy again if it were lost somehow.",4
"closest you can get to a real life war simulator. 10/10",1
"amazing game, mus buy if into military simulations or the arma series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"very realistic and has verstaile module options. a very realistic military fps/3rd person simulation game.",2
"its great! the vanilla game is fun to play, and when mods are installed the game is even better! play this game if you: like aircraft like tanks like open world games like to explore like to destroy things like to play multiplayer like to mess around like to rekt scrubs 8/8 m8",1
"brilliant... simply brilliant. needs some premium hardware to play, but other than that, it is worth your money.",3
"arma is an awesome game for anyone who is annoyed by all those mainstream shooters and would like to take on a challenge. it is also great for anyone wanting to get involved into modding! i highly recommend it! its one of the most fun games to play i have seen yet! now, i know arma has its flaws, and the longer you look at it, the more you find where you can say hey! that could have been done better! or why didnt they implement it? its a simple feature. but when you look at the good parts of the game, you see that those outnumber the bad stuff, really much. facts regarding above mentioned: -a3 dev team: 60 ppl (compare: dayz dev team: >100 ppl ; explains bugs, missing stuff) -a3 used new content (a2s models were ~5years old, from bis cancelled game#2; explains lack of content) -a3 was meant to be arma futura (explains future, and unrealistic setting) -source:",4
"great game. some good mulitplayer mods avaible for it too. altis life is well worth a blast",1
"good this is a good game, great graphics, id tap it!",1
"this game has got more bugs than a down market doss house. i have finally given up on it.",1
"if you take arma 2 and remove the third-world setting charm (balkans, middle east, africa, etc.), solid background of already existing mods (ace, various total conversions, well playtested islands), and dedicated community of milsimmers and replaced all of that with pseudo-operator lolmagpul multicam pmc greek futuristic garbage you get arma 3. you should buy it if and only if these things in arma 2 were of gamebreaking value to you: lack of ragdolls horrible vehicle physics (though a3 is not much better) having multiple guns to handle attachments as opposed to simply attaching items to the gun the gear system in general minimal amount of physical positions (prone, crouched, standing) other than that, stick to a2. theres just more to do.",1
"dont let the screenshots fool you. you have to have an amazing computer in order to play like that. for most people, trying to play the game on the higher settings will result in more lag than game. unfortunately on the lower settings the game looks 7 years old. graphics aside the gameplay is excellent and realistic like it should be. the episodic campaign is the biggest downside. it shows quite a bit of laziness on bohemia interactives part. its been almost 6 months since the full release and we still dont have the end of the campaign, also, the campaign isnt very good, but multiplayer makes up for it. i personally love wasteland and altis life. i would recommend purchasing this game primarily for its multiplayer.",2
"i want it but i dont have the money but it is highly reccomended",1
"great game, mechanics are great, co-op campaign is good, what bothers me is the price, i can understand it, but its quite the number",1
"crawling simulator - version 3.0 jokes aside arma iii is a blast. the environments are stunning, the weapon & vehicle details so well done, the guns actually kick, and the voice acting and sounds immerse you into the amazing world of stratis. with so much land (and now sea) you can really do any scenario on statis. the modding community is already creating/porting amazing mods into arma 3 and the community is great. if you want a real shooter that feels & plays great then arma 3 is your game.",1
"someone play with me right meow! this game is great. i wasnt too interested a year or two ago, but something shifted and i gave it a shot. this game is on my top 5 favorite game list. there are many reasons i love this game and i havent even played more then 50% of what this game has to offer. at the moment, i am doing the wasteland, king of the hilly type matches, but i am very eager try some casual rp with missions and objectives. however, i found the single-player campaign to be quite frustrating in some circumstances. i had terrible stamina management and seemed to get aim-botted by the enemy npcs all the time. i tried taking cover, sneaking, flanking, but someone always got me and i rage quit. i dont think ill be trying to finish that any time soon. 9/10",1
"went to war in a kart driver outfit and got shot in the head. 11/10",1
"aaaahh arma! the best simulator ever made for war games. the sandbox variations for every scenerio either real one that re-crated or your imagination gives the best expirience in this great franchise!",1
"this is possibly the best shooter and simulation game i have ever bought.",3
"great game! some of the best realistic gunplay and combat. the base game is good, but its the multiplayer that shines. things like altis life and battle royale will have you hooked.",1
"soo... i buy the beta at 59.99 but the game is now 35.99... i dont get this...",2
"- ,    .    : ,  -  ,      ,   .        . contra: bugs-bugs-bugs, (yet) small amount of in-game content. pro: scale, sometimes - unpredictability, high level of degrees of freedom, mods-mods-mods. verdict: one of the best of rare kind of proud creatures military simulator. period.",1
"i know there are a lot of nerds out there that seem to think that pressing 187 buttons just to take aim, is realistic. this is your game, not mine. cos this sucks so much balls, i think the devs would have no problem sucking a golfball through a gardenhose. it sucks more than a vietnamese  on xtc. it even sucks more than my dual stage vacuumpump. the flight model is appalling (im a pilot, try this  in anything that resembles a helicopter and they will be scraping your guts of the tarmac. the interface feels like a failed half life mod and reminds me of the days when i still had a 386 pc with 4mb of ram you have been warned. this is yet another game screwed up, most likely because of steampressure (get it?)",1
"all though i have not bought this game and have only been able to play on free weekends i can say this game is quite fun with friends and a large community :d",1
"very very tactical game, and a lot of fun to play with friends. 9/10",1
"love this game, great step up from arma ii, only complaint is there is only one jet.",1
"very good game. needs a little work with small graphical glitches every now and then, but very solid game. love the gameplay!",1
"probably one of the best games i own, everything about this game is great! 10/10 if i could i would  this game!",1
"meh. unless your a really devote tactical millitary fps player this probably isnt for you",1
"whilst being a unique and ambitious game with unparalleled scope and detail, the overly complicated bindings and game-mechanics and lack of any meaningful tutorials for the more complex systems often result in frustration. this game is known for its mod-ability, and whilst this is a blessing given the clunky unpolished state of much of the core mechanics, the number of community mods/ variations of gameplay modes adds to the confusion and inaccessibility of the multiplayer game. the poor optimization also leads to performance issues in multiplayer regardless of system specs. in summary- i want to love this game but its too demanding on my time and patience. this game is for the hard core milsim fan only.",1
"this game will leave you in tears of how awesome this is!! 10/10",1
"can recommend but dont expect to play as cod or bf shooter. learning curve is quite long :d",1
"realistic, beautiful, and good gameplay experience. there are bugs here and there, but they usually get fixed, the game in my opinion is a bit boring due to it being in the future, with non-existing weapons. it is too bad there arent any popular pvp servers though. the game looks and feels much better with loads of good mods to it and is extremely fun to play with others.",3
"fantastic game, great graphics, not too taxing on system resources, great ai, and provides an unsurpassed level of emersion. arma 3 truely is the closest you can get to real combat from your pc.",1
"i love arma 3 . my love for this type of game goes back to operation flashpoint. but i hate this  of a game at the same time, it still doesnt work properly. bohemia acts like here game done with their final release of the  campaign, but it is a game you will play and only enjoy it and the experiences 20% of the time, it will frustrate you more times than please you. i love it, but what a !",3
"this is not cod - ign 2013 3/10 awesome game - me 2014 9/10",4
"arma 3 is a good game you should buy it unless youre a part of isis",2
"an ok game. it has been out for awhile now and theyre more concentrated on making dlc/free scenarios rather than optimise the game!",1
"i had the lucky chance of playing arma 3 last weekend - which i had to compromise and complete my godlike mission of downloading it. got on a server , got shot in the head in wasteland for missteping into a territory which was 1 meter and amazingly there shot two ppl got ultimate loot and died. 10/10 would fap again.",1
"by far one of the best , or even the best fps game ive played in a long, long time.",1

"got arrested on my first day of gameplay for no reason in altis life. 10/10",1
"i liked very much arma / arma 2 and now i am getting this one !",1
"really enjoy playing this game. coming from cod and battlefield i love the realistic attributes to this game compare to the other two. battle royale is by far my favorite mode in this game",1
"i would buy it for sure a 2nd. time. its simply amazing. specially if youre playing it with friends. if youre a lone wolf you might not really enjoy this game at all.",1
"bohemia interactive outdid themselves with this game easily one of the best in the franchise to date. great modding community and forums.",3
"my friend if lying in what i can only decribe as a skip !0/10",1
"i would of recomended this game but as i was globaly blocked from the servers i will not recomend it simply for installing it on both of my hard drives ! = global ban wtf is that all about",1
"a3, better graphics, some things improved other things not. still the same awesome feeling. this game is great, that wont change.... a must have!",3
"its a great game but i think that we shouldnt pay for dlc that should have been a update... because lets be honest there hasnt been much change since alpha...",2
"great game! i love realistic fps games like these, and cant recommend it enough! teamwork and tactics are a necessity.",1
"cti and rpg gamemodes defo worth but only buy if its on sale peace love money",1
"arma 3 is very good game! :) i love....the rp mods are amaizing :)",1
"if you liked arma 2, you will love this even more.",1
"bugs, bugs, bugs and low frames. i have gtx 660 frostbite and i cant run in the max. i play bf3 ultra and 30frames... this game is waste of money",1
"a good follow up to arma 2. with updated graphics and smoother movements, certainly one of my favourite milltary shooterrs out there. however, i am missing the familiarity of guns that arma 2 had with its massive assortments of weapons and vehicles. would definitely like to see more added on to the game on that respect. ai are more intelligent. maybe too intelligent. however, with great game types like wasteland and an integrated steam workshop, it certainly delivers. mods may also add on to the game the same way dayz and ace did for arma 2.",4
"best war sim out there as of forever ago and forever on!!",1
"i just got the trial and i still loved it its relly fun with friends and epic :)",1
"this is like a drug. murder simulation, the sound is probably the best thing about this game. the first time you fire a simple 6.5mm round you realize this game is on a completely different level from anything else. some games can be more fun, but none are more real. sometimes youll have memories of killing people on certain maps and youll wake up in the morning and remember it, that place you went to and that person you killed. genuinely a feeling of disconnection will grow when you play other games because you dont feel like they properly exteriorize a sense of realism compared to arma 3. the sunlight is like video game wizardry ill never understand. closing this review ill say you should have confidence in yourself, play the multiplayer from the start, switch your rate of fire, run and kill kill kill.",3
"a game mode for everyone. its a must have in your game library. 1010",4
"amazing, it is everything you wish they fix in arma 2 !!",1
"been playing arma 2 since roll out and now that 3 is nearing release -i can not recommend any game above these. prefers beefey nvidia based machines. # is an overall more complete and smooth build. engine improvemants are excellent. only thing i can complain about is thst its not a 64 bit build. the day z stand alone should be respectable nd have less kiddies due to seperate purchase price.for now arma 3 wsaste land and domnation are fine for me.",1
"this game is growing so fast and the mods add a ton of new gameplay.....a must buy to be part of a great community",1
"i takes the origanl aspects of the other games in the series and make it ten time better worth buying",1
"i disobeyed my 12 year old commanders orders and mortared our supply station.",1
"really great game and i cant wait to put in some heavy hours",1
"highly recommend for peoples who wanted a more realistics military simulator over typical military fps.",1
"this game makes me cry out of my ears. it is very fun to play and is fun to annoy the crap out of people who play the game serious. i give this game a 10.000012/10 rating.",3
"this game is one of the best ive ever played on pc. amazing player interaction and very realistic gameplay. this game took military simulations to a whole new level. definetly worth it.",2
"great game! tons of gamemodes and tons of things to do. the campaign is awesome along with the multiplayer. i would reccomend this game! 10/10",1
"one of the best shooters out there. on ultra graphics the game looks real. the combat is so open that it is diffrent every time. i put 12 hrs on this game the first day i got it. with so many game modes it never gets boring. 10/10",2
"its like arma 2 but developed by the discovery channels future weapons program.",1
"/! this revue is for multiplayer only as there is no actual singleplayer content in this game. this game is weeks of fun with your friends if you can spend hours to learn the keymapping and the demanding gameplay. and it is years of fun if you can spend days to learn to use the complex mission editor. for me the hugest content in a fps ever, and features are still being added month after month.",4
"arma 3 is great war simulator besides some bugs / glitches you might encounter along the way, it is not like your usual shooter where you run and gun it requires patience and communication with your squad / team to be successful.",2
"there is nothing that i dont like about this game.",2
"i am very disappointed in arma 3. i was globally banned for not playing for 5 months and they found something suspicious in my game file for not playing.",1
"this is a really good game with amazing graphics. best to play with friends and to communicate.",1
"incredible game made by currently unpresidented developers, supporting probably the best online community ever. there isnt enough superlatives to describe the astoshining feat made by releasing this sandbox, at least not without sounding like a rant. frankly, take any favorite fps or military game. then add sandbox, quality, free dlcs and continuos improvements, scripting possibilties, all vehicles and weapons and maps readily avaiable from the first try, no need to rank up and no need to pay to win. i could go on much further, but the best source for factual information is of course [dslyecxi] his youtube channel:",1
"do you like to spend 30 minutes waiting to get deployed, only to have your helicopter shot down by an enemy jet? how about spending 20 minutes to get the the ao only to realize that your team has already captured it? do you want to know the feeling of waiting for hours to get into combar, just like real life? if you want real military simulation (including the time it takes to get into combat) then this game is for you.",1

"amazing military simulator, that i think everyone should get.",1
"9/10 fix multiplayer frame rates = 10/10 not quite understanding why multiplayer framerates are so bad, (30 fps max here on a gtx 780 on lowest gfx settings possible, yet 120 fps in singleplayer on almost the higest settings)",1
"spent 20 mins in the game, glicth died twice. the first time someone helped me up, the second no one was around so my option was to suicide...and i respawned with a blacked out screen. now i understand why dayz is having so much trouble, starting with an unplayable platform to begin with...wish id done some research before buying that one.",1
"some people wait a life time for a moment like this",1
"3/10 bad framerate almost always, steep learning curve, most game modes dont play the military sim it is built for they all play the rpg cops and robbers garbage. most servers kick you for wrong version even though its the same.",1
"you either love this game or you hate it. if you like games with military tactics and guns and stuff this is the right game for you.",1
"why is this even in my library i dont own it. must be from free weekend that happened 20 years ago and steam needs to do more often. anyway, game was fun but it is definitely not worth $60, plus another $18 for dlc. no way. for $60 you could buy two other games, a four pack of condoms, a bag of doritos, a bucket to use while you play games, and still have a bit left over.",1
"this game is amazing it has to be one of my favorite games. it never gets old. you can play so many different roles and you can view the battlefield in different ways everytime you play. now what are you waiting for buy this game!!!!!",1
"arma is not a game, in the same way that a word processor is not a document. want to play call-of-duty-level stuff? its got that. want to play rpg stuff? its got that. want to play survival horror? its got that. want to play a flight simulator? its got that. this softwares so good it will convince you to strap things to your head for headtracking and that this is perfectly normal. however, you will probably find you get the most out of this if you play with a clan. from we-want-to-pretend-were-in-the-army level of committment to the its-saturday-and-were-drunk-and-on-the-internet level of committment to the we-have-small-children-and-this-is-what-we-do-to-chill-out levels of normality, there are clans out there for anyones taste and needs. and hell, if youre a misanthrope, the singleplayer fun is still pretty damn awesome.",2
"awesome game with amazing multiplayer gamemodes and a ton of mods",2
"arma... i play the series of arma / operation flashpoint (cold war assault) since ... i think more then 12 years now. of course i had some breaks, played many many other games, but i keep coming back to it again and again. arma 3 is hmm, how can i say - an uncut diamond. at the moment there is a great base for the community, as there are many bugs annoying the community. we wanted it early, we got it early, so now we have to deal with the consequences - bugs, beta stadium campaign / scenarios. it already is a great tactical shooter just like the ancessors, i give both of my thumbs up - with one pointing at bohemia interactive (i adore you guys) for wanting them finish the game once.",1
"if you like arma 2, you will probably like arma 3 too. graphics are great (if you have pc good enough). gameplay is as it should be for arma - tactical. i think this is the one of the most realistic war games out there. there is also a preety nice community - you can play community created king of the hill, wasteland, other missions. dont forget to grab a microphone because working with team is so much fun and is actually what this game is about - tactical teamplay. in short: if you like war simulators with great graphics, teamplay and nice community i would recommend you this game.",1
"best real life combat simulator hands down there is no better foot, land, air and sea arma series does it like no other game i have played. player made addons and missions making this game stand like the leaning tower of pisa it may not be perfect but it does look and feel great.",1
"if you like arma ii youll like arma iii. if you havent tried arma ii you should definitely get that before you get this, to make sure you like the franchise as it is definitely a unique shooter. however, be warned as the game can be highly graphically demanding on the higher settings, and is comparable to arma ii on the lower settings (which is a little underwelming). all in all its a good game, and definitely one you should get in the beta due to its reduced price.",1
"arma 3 is an improvement and significant step forward over the previous in its franchise, securing its top spot as the go to for military simulation. arma 3 makes big steps forward with huge worlds and more varied vehicles and weapons. with the clever integration of the steam workshop, player-made content has never been easier to install and manage. a smart move by bohemia interactive because its these fan based mods that are the backbone of arma and will give arma 3 endless hours of replayability. with the effortless downloading and installation of a huge library of player created mods, from team driven tactical scenarios to the the chaotic survival mods, its a must have for any shooter enthusiast.",1
"great serious milsim game. lots of improvement in graphics from arma 2. the infantry movement is smooth and adds a realistic feel. without a doubt reccomend this game.",2
"really fun i dont much care for the corrupt cops on altis life or the people using mortars in wasteland or the idiots who play domination but its a fun game anyway but it sucks i bought it the day before it went on sale...",1
"in altis life we found a cop repairing his vehicle. me and my friends with ghillie suits got out of our stuck and told him to put his hands down. my friend hand cuffed him and stole his kidney. we lock picked his police truck and took the keys. my friend shoved him inside the car and we decided to try get him into the city to show off to everyone that we managed to capture a cop. on our way there my friend crashed the car into the wall going 100 km/h and the car exploded and killed us all. 11/10 ign would bang again.",1
"this game is great but i expect more thoe, but anyways its a great game. i havent tried the other mods yet and this game is still great. so this game has a lot of content. also its sad that it the dlcs are a bit overpriced for the content it offers. also one of the things i dont like about arma 3 is that they didnt use real names of weapons and vehicles. even has fake guys like the mx rifles. considering this to be a military sim, i expect real weapons and vehicles.",2
"its ok, but you will need to spend some time with learning the controls and what everything means, but other then that its a great game with amazing features! this includes: graphics, audio, gameplay, multiplayer, ect... but the game could improve by making it easer for first time players, so if you just want to just get a game and start playing, then this is probaly not for you, but like i said it still is a awsome game!",1
"first downloaded it, then i thought after 1500 hours with friends lan and in the editor: this is a great game i should buy it. best decision ever!",4
"fun for those who love a challenge and have the patience. a great shooter for those seeking something a little more realistic. cannot play like cod.",1
"the new age has arrived, imagine playing a dayz mod that doesnt eat  out of your cpu....it does exist friends, and arma 3 is its base. get it.",1
"love this game! if you dont mind running and driving few miles you will like it too.",1

"a true life like of experience of war is to be had in this game certainly the conflicts of the middle east are encapsulated in the king of the hill servers. driving around in your 200 dollar rented pick up truck, not really knowing where you are going, you squint awkwardly into the horizon; then you zoom in with your scope because you realize you are dumb. seeing little dots appearing you suddenly hear the distinct crack of gun fire. being the smallest of the three factions you barrel out knowing the overwhelming s***t flinging powers of even just a small detachment of enemies. the gunner fires wildly as the tires blow out and the car smashes into a wall. he is now dead. the passenger attempts to fix the car whilst you take over the gun, firing randomly into the distance until the shooting stops the car is fixed, you are still alive. you make it into town and rendezvous with your comrades. the truck stops as an rpg slams into it, exploading and killing all inside. you are dead. you respawn and do it all again.",1
"[do not read negative posts, they are extremely misleading] i went ahead and just bought it with the 50% off sale, and i wouldnt be angry if i had paid 60 dollars for it. it is a top game indeed with so much to do, it is more than a warsim, it is much more than what is advertised...dont think twice, just go get it! its definitely worth it. yes your pc needs to be somewhat good for this to run well but i was scared about this very same issue and turns out it runs amazing in ultra settings for me.",1
"super graphics and multiplayer very big map and a lot of technique and a lot of weapons, arma 3 the most realistic game i put it 10/10",1
"great game hours of fun you can play lots of gamemodes and will meet lots of people",3
"you scrolled too far..... the buy button is higer xd",3
"love this game id love to see some dlc for sasr or commandos! i recomend this to all my mates!",2
"awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"getting yelled at by trying to help your team reminds me of call of duty :3",1
"its a pretty good game, if you can get past its many bugs and dsync issues",4
"the game arma 3 is a superb sandbox military simulator. it has a campaign that showcases the game its self then it has individual showcases for elements inside the sandbox. it has an included editor for creating mission and mp missions. mods are very welcome element to this community. i have played altis life on the asylum server. this modification is a gta type atmosphere with lots to do. it has cops, civ, medic roles. housiong perm gangs and the like. i suppose i should mention some of the bad. the game can give frustration from time to time with hacking and game crashes. as unfortunate as it is it does exist. i had to spend a couple of days figuring out stop working errors. the game does get regular updates which help as well. also if you have a subpar rig this game can put some stress on your hardware. i get anywhere beteen 34-63 fps but some will have talked of worse fps thatn this. overall i reccomend this game just based on what is trying to be done here. this is a huge undertaking and very few games have the scope of this game with the and open sandbox experince.",2
"amazing game the createors realy out did thereselfs this time. and there is something for evryone there is many many different type of gamemodes.",2
"if you are an fps person, this is the game for you. it has an amazing campain, and 3 interesting maps that you can spawn ai in. personally i like the ai part, but all in all, its a great game",1
"this game is worth the $60 many different modes ranging from role-playing, wasteland, king of the hill, breaking point, tatical realism, and many others. this game is also more fun with friends 10/10",2
"ok first off holy crap this game is sweet. if you cant pay the normal 60 bucks wait till it goes for les( i got mine for 30 i think) i would call it a military simulation with a shooter twist. a great game thats lots of fun. you can be seriouse and treat it like its real life or just  around like i do most of the time and blow stuff up. if you liked dayz in arma 2 there is breaking point wich i play and that is pretty good but can get a little frustrating. but over all 10/10 would buy again. seriously if your pc can handle it get it.",2
"if you are looking for a proper army/war sim this is what you need. forget battlefield, cod and all the rest. arma iii is a sandbox true as you will find sim. not only that the modding community are 2nd to none, adding tones of extra content.",1
"awesome game. beautiful enviorments. ultra realistic. incredible mod community. highly recommend this game.",2
"love arma 3! one of my favs!, arma 2 was a big hit and now the third arma blew my mind away! keep up the good work arma",1
"teflon was wrong, this game is awsome. highly recommend.",1
"this is really great game the graphics are sexy playing with your friends is mad banter yep what more do you want?",1
"awesome game.. you get more than your moneys worth from this! all the different games you can play all from this 1 game!! altis life rpg, city life, epoch, breaking point and so many more.. i for sure recommend this game!!",1
"kick  game, worth the buy; been a fan since arma 2. realism to its fullest and requires skill. you should not find too many young call of duty players playing this.",1
"come on; two guys went to jail to make this, literally. this game is awesome in every way aside from the amazing difficulty wall.",1
"this game has effectively ruined my life. i barley shower or even leave the house anymore. i no longer have friends in real life and my girlfriend left me because i play it too much. 11/10, would play again.",1
"the graphics are great and the gameplay is good. the only negatives are the ai and stamina system.",1
"do not purchase. overpriced, lacking content. game wasnt fully finished after the beta ended. avoid and stick to arma ii",1
"this game is great, coming off from playing a lot of arma 2 this was a great change in this franchise. you can make this game whatever you would like it to be. always wanted to be a hard-core cop killing drug dealer? you got it! it is a great well made game. r8 8/8 m8 gr8 f8s & b8s",1
"the game needs a larger arsenal of guns and more vehicles for civilians, otherwise i see that the game is going along quite nicely.",1
"bought it, played it, ran it at 10 fps, still loved it.",1
"i love playing on epoch and altis life but i wish it was optimized.",1
"after playing an hour to check it out, well not my type of game, to much waiting, getting bored, never played arma but the concept i like very much , ....",1
"after so many hours trying to download this game on the free weekend i have some time to play it today, on sunday, and it wont start because of: ( no licenses) i dont know how this game is because it wont start on the suppose free weekend",1
"while there are still a few bugs, it really is a great game, much better than arma 2. highly recommended!",1
"amazing......doesnt beat arma 2 in map size though....though this campaign is better, along with more features, arma 3 is damn amazing...",1
"dont read this. you will be kissed on the nearest possible friday by the love of your life.tomorrow will be the best day of your life. now youve started reading this. dont stop. this is so freaky.1. say your name ten times.2. say your moms name five times.3. say your crushes three times.4. paste this to four other games.if you do this, your crush will kiss you on the nearest friday.but if you read this and do not paste this, then you will have very bad luck.send this to 4 games in 143 minutes. when youre done press f6 and your crushs name will appear in big letters on the screen. this is so freaky because it actually works lol",1
"bought this game for more dayz. found many different life mods and a couple others that are really fun. great buy and i havent even played any of the arma 3 missions yet!",1
"if theres any game i like, its arma 3 with its amazing gamplays. arma 3s singleplayer is fun, but i think multiplayer is the best",1
"this is the best military simulation game that there is.",3
"for me personally arma 3 is the game i love to play te most, weather im attacking a squad and battling in wasteland or fighting for kavala in king of the hill or my personal favorite role playing in altis life theres a community for everyone and this makes arma 3 the game it is. its more than just a war simulator its been made into a game where you can play with friends and still have a relexed fun and enjoyable experience for everyone and for the hardcore shooters out there there is still the intnsity of battle for you guys too! to conclude id strongly reccomend this game and it is seriously worth checking out!",5
"this game is awesome and its so worth the 60$ price with all the mods and content.",3
"make even less friends than in arma 2 since more people play it and they dont want you on the helecopters even if you promise youll be nice",1
"this game is amazing, even though it has some rather big optimization issues. i can deffinitely recommend it for something like the wasteland gamemode!",2
"completely realistic and fun. needs more weapons but the realism is unbelievable. worth the money, really laggy (if you have a bad computer) but once you tweak the game, it will make the game less laggy. another thing is that the buildings are so high quality that when you go near them, you lag. even when you are near hangars!",1
"arma 3 isnt just one of the most realistic military simulations/games but it also has extensive modpack support and lets you enjoy modpacks such as altis life (gta style rpg) aswell as wasteland and many others. well worth the money imo.",3
"if you want a good game to roleplay in get this game, it has the altis life mode which is like gta online on steriods but with real roleplay and jobs. 10/10.",1
"no other game is like arma. nothing will ever be like arma. you need this game.",4
"arma 3 is way more than a game. arma 3 has a vast variety of things to do in the game and it gives you an amazing feeling of what its like being in the military. you can fly a helicopter or planes, roll out with a tank or an ordinary car, you can use boats, etc. this game also has amazing graphics and it feels like your in the game. but the best part is the developers. they have made the game way better than when it came out, and they continue to do so. 10/10",1
"absolutely fantastic simulator game. wether you play it as an simulator,a role-playing game,or an ordinary shooter,arma 3 has everything to be able to deliver to any first-person/third-person shooter fan,offering a variety of gamemodes,and mods. pick it up,now!",1
"this game copied off of call of duty. run and gunners get 37 kills while the 37 campers scratch their balls and die. then they have these a.i missions made by babies for babies. easiest game i have ever played gonna have to give it 0/10 no quickscoping.",1
"best warfare simulator out there. not only teamwork is a requirement but the knowledge in all vehicles as well as zones, weapons, pace & victorious beastings on all levels of your senses. this is not like cod this is not like battlefield this is a real time warefare simulator. (you need a pretty sharp machine to run this game at a respectable rate so be aware) 9/10",1
"the game is awesome. needs alot more mods though. arma 2 has a better mod selection. comon people make some mods!",1
"really fun and realistic game, i just wish setting up servers that work were a little easier...",1
"this game is amazing, lots of great new features and genrally a good game overall",3
"much better than arma 2 (better gameplay, controls, graphics & performance). solid buy.",1
"cant join any servers anymore. 10/10 wouldnt join again!",2
"cant say enough good about this game, so much more fun than the run and gun games. i enjoy making missions and playing them with my friends, the mod community has to be one of the best ever... other than some bugs here and there which i know the game is constantly being improved upon makes it one of my favorites, if you are tired of the generic run and gun shooters and want a game that actually makes you have to think , ammo count, health, team members, this is the one. i got tired of the others. (wont mention their names ) they kept tweeking them and wrecked the games for me. so you could say i got tweeked right out of them. i am a little over a half century old and have been gaming for many many years. the operation flash point days were a blast, and to see this evolve into what it is today is just great. if i could add anything to this game, it would be the ability to jump, and maybe a flame thrower tank. and the ability to put c4 on a small drone :) i recommend this game for fun",2
"one of the best military game i ever played! although it has some annoying bugs and questionable ai, it still be a great game to have if you are into realistic game. aside from the core gameplay, this game contain a load of mod! you can turn military simulation game into zombie-survival game by choosing mods in steam workshop! 9/10 if i dare say.",1
"arma is very good but i think arma 2 is better but still a very good game.",1
"*not a gameplay review* oksy so i only had this game a few days and i have been playing around with zeus just testing some things and i had a area set up to snipe on then comes the dlc ads. i payed $66 for this game so i am not very happy with you shoving ads in my face to spend another 17 dollars on it. i bought the karts dlc because it was so cheep and it got a few new suits and cars. but 17 dollars for dlc and your shoving ads in my face to buy it? thats a big no!",1
"take my word for it, buy this game and play it, youll have fun and feel like a real soldier, make sure you have a good computer to run it, you need about 20+fps to have a good time. the best way to get a good time out of arma 3 is to join regin of terror (a gaming community)",5
"one of the best shooters i have played, blows battlefield and cod out of the water.",2
"absolutely fantastic and never played before game. this game is a beast! i recommend this game with 9/10 stars",1
"this game is as close as youll get to being in a real war. frustratingly realistic.",1
"good game, bit of a system hog, modding community makes this a great game.",1
"amazing. so much to do. so much content. whoever likes sim-style games/the arma series. this is (after some patching and content adding by the devs ;) ) definitely a must have! edit: too bad they add all these (expansive) addons, but now after the game and campaigns are finished its for me like an amazing sandbox/sim/fps game, that only the kerbal space program can reach in terms of replayability. very well done bohemia.",1
"really nice game.. beautiful aswell. just the campaign made me rage xd",2
"good game im just starting to play the story but for some rerason when i try to play on a atlis life server i lag out and get disconnected.",1
"this game is great. i would suggest playing the gamemode called altis life in multiplayer. find the right server and have fun! you choose your lifestyle on the giant playground altis has to offer. with friends, or not, its one of those things that work either way.",2
"you can kill people without knowing anything about them and you still do it because youre a mother ing american",1
"what a brilliant game. this has got to be one of the best games in my library without a doubt. firstly the altis life (gamemode in game) is f*cking awesome! ive never seen role play like it. there is very minimal rdm (random death match otherwise known as kosing) which is rare in a game like arma. in no other game, can you go up to someone, pretending to be an undercover police officer, tie his hands with zip ties, rob him, take his clothes and cut out his kidney classing the whole thing as standard police prosedure what a game xd graphics: 9/10 altis life: 9/10 community: 9/10 realism: 9/10 overall: 9/10",1
"horribly optimized, but still an overall great game. the new dlc update really helped with the weapon sway.",1
"best military sim franchise out there its a must have for pc gamers even if it is a bit buggy",3
"very realistic game, its funny if you play with your friend but its also cool alone",1
"great game. a little power hungry, very buggy, and slightly boring alone. but a fantastic multiplayer milsim.",2
"this game is great. its loads of fun playing rp, and doing domination i recommend everybody buys this game.",1
"best army simulation in entire time then ill play games...wery nice work :)",2
"initially, i bought this game because i wanted to play wasteland or something coming from arma 2. this was back in alpha. it sucked , and i left the game to collect dust for a long time, then one day when it finally got released, a whole new gaming experience overwhelmed me! completely swept me off my feet with the mechanics that this game has to offer, and due to one of the latest updates being zeus it has made gaming to a whole new level. since becomming a fan of the arma 3 i now own 2 servers for a community named stdelta. its the most fun you could have with a war simulator you could ever have your hands on. would definately reccomend this game to any gamers looking for a challenge in their gaming. live long and drop the the floor and do the dinosaur. ~hash",3
"you can do almost everything you can with a gun, close quarter battle but also major battle with a lot of armed or support vehicles. in fact unlike what its said hardcore military simulator, the field is open to noob. if you want to be simple you can just do so, serious battle or something simple or just enjoying living life in huge number of on/offline scenarios in about 300km^2!! this is just a sandbox gun game!",2
"can you make this free game so that everyone will install this until it returns into payment until march 13",1
"love this game, although, good luck getting any kills :3",1
"well had game for a bit, not worth the $$ id say dont buy this game, this game feels like it was made for the year 2005. games choppy its not a smooth shoooter, mapes are boring looks like a shity run down russian cold war town..",1
"this game is; 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of the will 5% pleasure 50% pain and 100% reason to purchase the game.",1
"one of the best games ive played in a long time. needs a good few mods to make it really good, but totally worth the effort.",2
"this game is such a piece of . come on bohemia, learn some  from your previous mistakes. the snipers are near impossible to use due to the dramatic weapon sway even when laying on the ground after 10 minutes. my player is tired after 10 seconds of sprinting and my game seems to run the same on ultra settings as it does on all low. the arma engine is absolutely terrible and needs to be completely re-done. the ing go karts drive like  like the rest of the ing vehicles. i run over a wooden fence and my car blows up. the dumbest  will really piss you the  off in this  waste of money.",1
"thank you bohemia interactive for confirming my beliefs that you have lost it. i am not paying $15 for helicopters. get ed.",1
"solid game. im disappointed they didnt polish it up a bit more before launch, but overall its an enjoyable experience and one that ive put a lot of time into. just make sure your pc can run it smoothly.",1
"honestly i think this is the best game ive bought on steam. not only the best military shooter ive ever played but the best simulator and multiplayer community. there are too many gamemodes to get tired of the game and too many good mechanics of the game to get sick of it. i get pumped every time i open the game and hear the intro music and never regret buying it. i highly recommend this game to anyone.",1
"arma2 with some new weapon stances, granade shortcut keys and zeus live mission mode. definately worth getting with discount - would not recommend paying full price if u got arma ii already.",1
"if you like strategic military combat in a vast open world, then get this game. if u like battlefield, then youll love this game. i got cod advanced warfare, and played it about an hour, after which i found myself back in the lands of altis wasteland (arma 3). played over 100 hours in the last 2 weeks, seriosly, so get it already.",5
"absolutely astonishing gameplay, backed up by a great community. i also highly recommend breaking point (so you can play it with me.)",1
"amazing war simulator. the workshop and modding community give you the opportunity for expansion of the base game, and the core game itself is wonderful.",2
"very good made looks very nice with ultra settings, got so many gamodes aswell!",2
"one of the best games i have ever played 11/10 buy now!!!",3
"amazing game, totally worth getting graphics 10/10 multiplayer 10/10 campaign not finished/10 dayz,altislife,wasteland etc mods 10/10",1
"an awesome game, been playing since arma 1 and it never failed to satisfy my cravings for war.",1
"i recommend this game,but now have litlebit bugs is force close i dont know it close just fix it i will happy.",1
"good game... gets boring if ur under 18 though lol",1
"an awesome game not like any other military games u need more tactics in this one i like it alot i spend more then 400hrs on this game specialy the altis life mod",4
"one of the best simulation games ive ever played! :d",1
"only get this game if you have a good computer i havve a decent computer and play the game on the lowest settings and get an average 20 fps but besides that this is a fun game theres gamemodes like battle royale whichis hunger games with guns life servers which is rp but you have to be 16 or older to be a cop or play half of those life servers looking at you arma 3 life there also is a story mode for you to practice with the complicated controls like almost the whole format should be rebinded and tweaked by you but im used to them and can go about playing in these servers with my 20 fps",1
"a lot of potential for a good game but alas it is . terrible campaign, horrible ai, more bugs than there are types of insects. clunky slow interface. would not recommend getting this game to my worse enemy",1
"so far only played the epoch mod. tried the campaign and as soon as im done with the tutorial, i recieve an error message. tried reinstalling the game and deleting the mod files. still doesnt work. but the mods make up for that so id still recommend this game but wait till its on sale, steam always has sales.",1
"im a little upset that i just bought this game not even a week ago ..now its on sale!wtf! i feel i should get compensated because i havent even played it yet barely ..!rawr!",1
"my initial review said that arma 3 would be a great game by late 2014 when more mods and content were released. i am glad to say that this became true several months before i expected. between the incredible zeus game mode (an on-the-fly mission creator) and excellent mods like advanced gameplay mod, task force radio and alive this is one of the best co-op games available. you will need at least 4-5 people to really have fun in multiplayer, but theres really no other game that offers what arma does.",2
"the 43 minutes i played were great. i would not do well in the military",1
"this game is extremely detailed and fun, if you want a good game to play with your friends, this is the game for you.",4
"the game is damn good. but it has worst optimization ever. i probably need 2 titans to run arma on medium setings. do not recoment for weak pc like mine. (970 phenom, 560gtx.)",1
"a fantastic game! its still in his alpha but its completely fantastic. its worth those 25 bucks you pay for it.",2
"this is the sequel to black ops 2. everyone throws away a bunch of the high-tec stuff, and now people fight more like its 2012, even though its 2030something. fight against the army of greece and all of their spartans, so that zombie menendez cant steal reznovs gold!",1
"possible the best mil sim game out there, it is a must buy for all those hardcore military gamers. with the slight learning curve this game has definitely makes it even more fun.",2
"its a bit buggy and glitchy, but an overall fun experience if you like military simulators",1
"game has great potential but it lacks easy interface for multiplayer aspect of it, just seems too messy, complicated and difficult to find reasonable server to play on, make it more user friendly, perhaps look how bf4 multiplayer search works, and then this game would be top notch!",1
"nice game. great military-simulation. plenty of community made mods.",3
"if your looking for a military sim, then this is the game you want. the core of the game is simply unbelievable. simply a awesome game.",1
"great game, different server have different mission and you can play ho ever you want be it the lone wolf to hit squad",1
"feels incredibly unfinished and incomplete on so many levels and in dire need of major improvements and added content to make this as interesting to play as its predecessor. which is a shame as the new infantry controls are a godsend but it does not save a really marred and blemished product that is very lacking. frankly youre better off waiting until the first major expansion until you get this game unless you simply have to play wasteland.",3
"extremely good game, its very open in what you can do",2
"good game needs more interactive modes for most fun as there is a lot of traveling and not mutch shooting but is still great",1
"amazing game, amazing graphics, amazing price i am totaly recommending this game!",1
"realism: this is the key of this game but it is realistic for real ? if youre a gamer you could probably say yeah becouse there are some elements that makes everything feel a real war... ...but (!!!) in my opinion this realism is not so realistic. war feeling is awesome but the bad things on this game are the details ( weapons reload, medkit others, repairing vehicles, your blood that desappears when you put adrenaline (???) in yourself...) this game is worth buying for people who likes the genre, but i expect more couring of details in next patches .",1
"ok first off holy crap this game is sweet. if you cant pay the normal 60 bucks wait till it goes for les( i got mine for 30 i think) i would call it a military simulation with a shooter twist. a great game thats lots of fun. you can be seriouse and treat it like its real life or just  around like i do most of the time and blow stuff up. if you liked dayz in arma 2 there is breaking point wich i play and that is pretty good but can get a little frustrating. but over all 10/10 would buy again. seriously if your pc can handle it get it.",2
"extremely fun and a bit of an adrenaline rush at times if you are playing wasteland or koth, recommend playing with a crew and get some comms up for the ultimate experience! i plan to spend more time pew pewing baddies and taking their loot! quite and amazing amount of detail in the game, sometimes im amazed at the littlest things i see in game.",1
"i wish it ran smoother but its a great improvement from arma 2",2
"this game is awesome. most realistic games play, i love to use the m14 and snipe enemies from a hilltip. the driving is also good. a few mods in this game and its awesome.",3
"arma 3 is a simulator first/third person shooter, one of the most realistic games ive seen come by in a long while. you better have a good computer if you plan to play multiplayer some servers really take a beating on framerate, if you like military or just good ol pvp in general this is quite the game to sink some time into... the new map dont hold how special wasteland was in alpha/beta but its still the core mentallity of the gameplay.",5
"cant go wrong with this game. servers can be buggy at times, but i assure you, its great if you want to get it right now (summer sales) 50% off!!",2
"jump in a guys car yells at me takes me to a gas station shoots at me has  aim gets his buddies to shoot at me they have  aim i get away 9/11 not enough terrorism",1
"best arma ever so many game types and weapons best open world fps/3rd",1
"keeping it real - bohemia is one of very few developers making games for the pc platform. besides beeing a very beautiful game, the frenchise is pushing the envelope and bringing you a community game - modable and keeping you, the player, the most important part of the game. on todays games-market, the arma experience is like no other. this game is one of the reasons why we still buy personal computers - cus we like to play personal games :) buy it!!",5
"got it just for altis life and found there was much more to it!",2
"ive got to say, this game is truly great in most ways.ive played for how long i do not know but i did play a lot, the problem is you play for hours and hours with doing almost nothing to just get killed by someone who has all the stuff...",1
"supported the game in alpha. didnt even get a discount on dlc which is basically an update. dont support this business model. its a great game if you like milsims, try to find it on sale with the dlc included.",1
"its not a good game for newbies. no, its not... i use to sit at a place and watch the sunset. i have no idea how to actually shoot, drive and complete missions. its like my personal sunset simulator. and its damn beautiful. 10/10",5
"this game is great. arma 3 has lots of fully customisable guns, great selection of vehicles, and has great modding potential. it runs with more ease than arma 2. my pc averaged 15 fps on arma 2 and averages around 28 on arma 3 with the video settings turned up higher. this game also has a great multiplayer setup and you can have a server up in minutes. and the campain is awesome and actually playable must have. worth every cent i paid plus some get it now #dope",2
"i dont even own this game, but its so good that i have transcended the mortal boundaries of steam to write this. >starts a campaign game >instantly sniped by ai in the first fight >reload save game >rinse and repeat its a very good military sandbox. trust me, its worth the weight.",1
"its like arma 2 but with less content, poorly optimised and cash grab dlc (loadmasters anyone?). was hoping it would get better but its still worse than arma 2 in almost every way except graphics, i think ill stick to operating in chernarus and takistan instead of a greek island that has anti-framerate technology.",1
"its arma2 brought to a new level which id never expect it to reach. finding a clan or team and doing missions together defenitely is the most fun and epic thing ever! if youre not that realistic tho there still is king of the hill which is one big bloodbath for you cod players ;) defenitely a 10/10 if you ask me!!",2
"arma 3 in short! the good: - nice graphics - good sound (guns etc.- but some problems with 5.1 ss) - large map - lots of gear - mp - coop the bad: - the ai (it sucks aaaasssss, like no other i have ever seen - really, both your team mates and the enemy) - animations and the movements of soldiers are robotic* (with ai) - (mp) server lags with large no. of players",1
"my first day playing a3 was awfull now i just cant quit ,its too good its as good as it gets now i know why ppl call it an army simulator cus it is",2
"realism enthusiasts regroup! this game is very immersive, to make you feel like you are in a war, a simulator. call of duty and battlefield players, feel free to join and man up!",2
"i really like this game but can someone please for the love of god fix the issue where i cant use the advanced stances in this game? i mean for a premium so expensive you would think the video game worked properly yet for some reason there is a fairly essential stance  up in the game and thats absurd truthfully. great game, annoying bug. felt like i should have spent less money to get pissed off with a product thats otherwise working great except for where controls are deleted right from the menu.",1
"not only is it one of the most beautiful settings in all of video games, it is the most accurate military simulator avalible, always great fun with large parties of friends, but you also meet great people by playing in game, recommend you get teamspeak for this game, and research some great mods, becuase it is a large community modded game which makes it even more fun. also watch some how tos before you play so youre not totally blind sided, also know this is not call of duty, the game involves tactics and survival instinct to play, you will get destroyed if you one man army in this game. only down side is you do need something relitivly powerful to run the game so look at your specs. otherwise great game.",1
"very good and fun army simulator. never get bored.",1
"if you have a pc that can run this game at atleast medium settings 30fps. best 60$ you have ever spent.",2
"expect a solid peice of interactive software that mavis beacon teaches typing fans are sure to enjoy",1
"this game grew on me. one of my favorite youtubers plays this somewhat often so i was decently familiar with the idea of the game before a few friends told me to get it. weve played a few of the multiplayer modes and recently been playing the battle royale mod, (which is a blast when you finally get into a reliable server). as others have mentioned, this is more of a combat simulation. its unforgiving, which is why players need to use actual tactics to accomplish a goal. sometimes things get slow, but that only helps to make confrontations way more exciting. im looking forward to trying out much more of what this game offers, which is a lot.",1
"first time playing alits life i got ran over by a cop. 10/10",1
"very fun game if you are into realism games. the online needs work but bohemia has been known to have a strange multiplayer connection. i have put a lot of hours in this game thanks to the duws mod. if you wanna have fun play this game there is so many types of games within this. altis life, king of the hill, etc.",2
"i love this game but an alien addon would be great tho :)",2
"amazingly well done game. awesome mods, no bugs, running smooth even on week pcs. i recommend this game for everybody",5
"personally love the arma series, 3 started off good but has since got unplayable for me after each update. gone from 60fps to sometimes under 30 regardless of server or game type. nothing has changed at my end, so given up for now. edit: ok, on my new pc this gaming is truely awesome. just one of those games that needs a nearly insane amount of hardware to run best",1
"arma 3 is not quite a first person shooter, it really is more of a war simulator overall. it is highly detailed and looks great visually but there can be a bit of a learning curve. the games strong point, in my opinion is the way it tries to do multiplayer, where you make missions and what not. i find this single feature what makes arma stand out the best. more shooters should have the level of control arma 3 gives players. there were a few cons to all of its pros though, so i will list my biggest as follows. 1. multiplayer servers (if not set up properly and efficiently) can make the game squat down and take a huge dump on your fps (frames per second) 2. i feel the multiplayer user interface could use some work. making the game more accessible to new players. 3. better single player. arma may be best for its multiplayer but i think overall more work could be done making the single player experience more enjoyable. all in all i think arma 3 does the shooter/ war simulation best, it may not be as popular as games like cod or battlefield but thats not a bad thing. imagine if it was that popular, then we would be dealing with those guys...",1
"incredible graphics and amazing gameplay, thats arma in a nutshell. this time they have hit the mark, and by that i mean presenting a game that can utilize the best in the latest hardware. for me its the i7 2011 pin with a gtx 660ti, on a asus rog rampage-iv formula. i dont recommend using anything less than a decent gaming rig for this one, it doesnt need to be the best but pay attention to the graphic demand and ensure you use a good card. im absolutely hooked on this new direction that bohemia interactive have taken, all the traditional game play is still present as well as many new twists, a nicely built mission editor and of course, that very impressive scenery. my only gripe, and its not really relevant here, is that this game could really use clickable cockpits and vehicle controls, imagine having the best in eye-candy and adding a real sim feel to it,,, hinnnt to the moders :) buy this one, dont even bother dwelling on it folks, its a must have even for the offline players.",1
"best game ever.. hands down the most realistic first and third person shooter ive ever played, just get it.",2
"what the hell battaleye i got a bloody globle ban for what i did use any hack and i got ban for some resone what the hell in going on i use all my money for this and now i got ban for some reson what the hell",1
"this is a review coming from a hardcore cod player. dont get me wrong i love playing cod but its the same thing every match with the same game types. i wanted something i could play it smart and be very tacticle. no running and gunning. if you are looking for a game where multiplayer matches would be short and crazy, this is not it. multiplayer is a whole other monster in arma. single player is fun, the campaign is cool and dlc is awesome. playing missions online is soo fun and communication is pretty much required. special gamemodes online add a garrys mod element to it allowing for something different. though i havent had much time to play it it hasnt felt like i have even scratched the surface. its a different shotter, you really are the soldier.",1
"its a cool strategic game if you find the right players and mods...it can go a far way when communitys get there hands on you.",2
"this game made me ejaculate so violently and explosively that i blacked out, waking up two weeks later with my house being robbed and my body being stripped down completely bare. the only thing the robbers didnt take was my computer, so i dragged my crusty, naked body over to my desk and started playing arma 3 again. 11/10",3
"amazing it was what i thought battlefield 4 would be, immersive and realistic, altis life is also whatg i thought gta online would be like",2
"this game is  compared to arma2. gear loadout saving process is  and not working, optimization is , ai is . in other words, its a downgrade. keep playing arma2 until this game is patched/fixed",1
"if you like military games , you should buy arma 3 because its gonna be best military game ever you heard",1
"spent hours setting up the perfect assault. breached the compound, took out some enemies. open a door, *snap snap snap* shot in the face. start from the beginning. 9/10 would get shot again",1
"excellent, just absolutely excellent game. the possibilites and endless scenarios that you can create yourself just makes this games one of the best games of this genre, and possibly one of the better and more unique games for pc. unrivalled in creativity and possibilities, arma 3 is a masterpiece added to the genre. bohemia delivers, yet again.",3
"infinite possibilities to do whatever you want. good investment!",5
"new mechanics, less gear. thats all i can say. i miss the mass of equipment in arma 2, now a days you can buy some more  purely for vanilla mp servers. so yeah, equipment is in lower quantity with a bit better quality. the downside is the s want you to pay 66 bucks still, i payed around 30 or so when it first came out. so, i recommend this game, lots of cool , but on the other hand ill point out the lack of crap in comparison to arma 3, also vanilla maps suck. modding it is a helpful option to deal with the lack of vanilla .",2
"best military simulation on the market!! definitely worth your money!",2
"unfortunatly, i was unable to play the multiplayer very well because of the horrible frame rate i was having... i would not recomend you buy this game if you dont have above average gaming pc",1
"most if not all reviews of this game took place before they had a campaign, workshop support, and zeus. i love this game... thats all i have to say.",1
"this game does not live up to its predessors. was very dissappointed.",1
"i realy like this game, iv been wanting a game like this for a while, its like the audio from dayz but beter and the graphics are on ultra and run perfect on my computer my favourites modes would be roleplaying in the arma 3 life its fun when your a cop mostly i like being an innocent and then smuggle guns throughout the world anyways 10/10 happy to have gotten this game for 39.99 aud it was only 29.99usd now its 59.99usd but anyways its still totaly worth it",1
"real simulator, veeery hard i wanted to refund... but its eally a great game",1
"great game! a little bit buggy as it is in alpha and may have some performance issues but other than that buy this bad boy and get on a wasteland server and shoot people in the face!",1
"this game is so chic!!!!! i recomment it. the graphic is amazing.",1
"i have a lot of fun with this game but with heli dlc the ed up totally flying with heli and its now impossible to do so better dont buy this game its",3
"yea this is amazing if you like blowing  up flying  driving  killing",1
"awesome war simulator with some great detail! i love it, even tho i only played it since a week ago. the most things are awesome. most things i still know from the awesome game arma ii operation arrow head where in this. the controls were changed a bit in helicopter controls but nothing major. if you like a nice war simulator (not call of duty or battlefield) you should look into arma ii or arma iii. these games are awesomely made! 8 out of 8, m8!",1
"this could be a great game but is way too demanding....my pc beats the minimum requirements and still runs laggy no matter the setting even on the lowest settings its still bad,,,,,dont buy unless you have a high performance pc or it will be a waste of money. keep in mind what ive described above was on solo/single player, online is much worse even if its a dedicated server. dont click the buy button you have been warned",4
"great game. go either in third person or first person and you can still have a lot of fun! role-playing in the game mode altis life has been awesome and hilarious so far as well as playing the game modes deathmatch and king of the hill! although bohemia interactive never optimize their game... 8/10. outstanding gameplay but lack of optimization.",2
"amazing army game, i really like the designs, the weapons, and the missions, its a great game to play with friends, altis life, domination, and more !",1
"great game, mechanics are great, co-op campaign is good, what bothers me is the price, i can understand it, but its quite the number",1
"arma 3 is a game changer. going from call of duty, to battlefield, to this and its on another level. started it up, joined a server and met up with my squad. we rushed and invaded a small town where we were ambushed by tanks and snipers. one of my teammates was screaming through his mic as if this game was real life. after 20 minutes of trying to figure a way around the ambush we all got killed by a helicopter and respawned. two thumbs up.",1
"awesome!! really good game! you can do so much in this game!",2
"this game is just awesome. ppl may complain its too expensive, but they are rly wrong. for what an arma game have and for what the community build for the game its a pretty cheap price you are paying. expect to have hundreds of hours of gameplay, because you wont master all the skills necessary to enjoy the full content of the game in just 10 hours. this game is not for casual players.",3
"sand-box, tons of mods, extremely fun and realistic gun plays, huge community. what else do you need for a good game?",1
"this is a very good game overall can have alot of fun on this.",5
"a fantastic military simulation game. i have not had so much continous fun from a game in years, since crash bandicoot on ps1. i cannot express how awesome the arma community is and how much i love the game.",1
"awesome. now they are selling helicopter physics patch and weapons that they promised to include into the release version as dlcs. great job, bis. go  yourself.",1
"dis gaem reel bad optimizine but its k cuz i get los of fps so its sweglyf",1
"love the game would like a dynamic campaign to be included",1
"on march 31, 1998, blizzard released a certain video game that allowed users to create custom maps that changed the way the entire game was played. to play one of these maps, you simply had to join a lobby where it automatically downloaded and you were good to go! on september 12, 2013, bohemia interactive released a video game that allowed users to create custom maps that changed the way the entire game was played. to play one of these maps, you simply had to attempt to join a server, realize it doesnt work, google it, determine which sketchy website was the official one for that particular mod, download the mod and apply it in your game folder, set some launch options in steam, then hope to find a working server. if you wanted to play any other game type after that, it would refuse to let you until you do the same thing for their mod, in addition to disabling your previous one (since you might be a hacker if you have files they dont use for their specific mod!!!). in addition to that, you cant even play the regular game. if you search for a team deathmatch server or something like that, there are no servers, or only a few with 0-1 people playing on them. this game might be good if you could actually play it... maybe.",1
"its pretty its great and you get super mega frustrated when you die. alot of fun super steep learning curv beware! arma 2 vets will have a blast and so will any fps fan its a very emersive game play and very rewarding experience wether you are flying a squad to and from the hot zone or running around as a medic and saving lives its a blast once you learn the gameplay youll just keep coming back 8 thumbs up out of 10",1
"the gameplay is really captivating and you will have lots of fun playing a3, definetely the best war/army simulator",1
"i had a lot of fun playing it with my friends, looking forward for arma iv ;)",3
"well, all that i can say about this game is that, with all the game breaking glitches, random deaths, wall glitching, and leg stretching glitches... this game is ing amazing! i love how when i shoot someone, they bounce and make it unrealistic, and the amazing bush wookie graphics. if people have  computers i can just sit in an open grass field and no one will ing know! bush wookies are amazing all in all and truly make this game. with out the bush wookie suits... this game is terrible... buy it now! murica  yeah!",2
"i played this when the trial was out (i forget when) but even with the visualys turned all the way down this game was breath taking. i only played with the artiliry tank for a bit so i wont talk about that game itself but from what i did play in this and arma 2, this is a perfect fps.",1
"more than 600 hours in game, last version (1.14) and even today i feel like i play a beta version of the game, too many bug!! poor physics, which i could be refund...",5
"now when the game finally has gotten some improvements to the framerate... its still just playable. anyone that thinks his got a bad computer should not buy this game. it will need the best pc components out there to even get near 60fps. poorly optimised game, but once you found the settings that works with your computer it can be a fun game. but still the slow movement, stopping while changing weapon is a deal breaker. im dissapointed that they didnt learn anything from arma 2. what i think about the game 1 is worst 5 is best graphics = 5 gameplay = 3 sound = 2 optimised = -3 playable? sure when you got the best pc there is to buy and nothing better to do.",1
"you can control the weather 10/10 would buy again.",1
"honestly. i wouldve written a review on this game long ago but it took over my life. pros: awesome graphics (and sound) realistic huge modding community not too many trolls easy to pick up (although flying can take a little bit) great community altogether ive made many friends cons: some weird bugs hackers (although they are dealt with by in game admins usually quickly) i really cant think of much to put in cons altogether it is a very good game id give it a 9.5/10. the bugs in the game are the only thing keeping it from being a 10/10 stuff like falling off a 2 foot rock and recieving enough damage to die. other than that great game and would buy it again.",2
"ultimate game for lovers of war and realism, excellent physics, and optimum gameplay...though it seems to me it is incomplete!!!",1
"definetly a step-up towards more realistic gameplay than cod and battlefield series. steep learning curve with all sorts of options in how to affect your avatar in the environment - too many for most of us - so it really takes time to get into. huge sandbox environments so plan on spending several hours in a match rather than your typical 20 minute arcade-shooter match. some of the options and controls do feel a little clunky at the moment. you do need a pretty decent rig to run on full graphic settings to get the most out of it. challenging - very challenging. great realism - it can be fustrating for new players so expect it going in.",1
"graphics are bad. they shouldnt build a game trailer based on their low graphic cinematics, that wont help them sell the game.",1
"amazing and very realistic game, with plenty of mods and a very active online community",2
"10/10 this is a great game if you are looking for something alot more realistic than cod or battlefield or anything else along those lines. from the campaigns beginning to end you are spending time to even get to the primary objective, this is great because you get to see how much time and effort went into this masterpiece. then we get into the firefights every thing from learning how to shoot to mastering the ammount of bullet drop for each gun you can spend hours and even days mucking around with the hundreds of controls. on top of that there is dlc and user-made content and i for one cannot describe how much i am anticipating for a dayz mod for this game it would be amazing.",2
"my opinion about this game is that its bugged and people just camp worse than the camping in cod and bf i truly regret buying this game and i only bought it cause my friends say its great rubbish this game is no where near worth $60",1
"if youre reading this review and not playing arma 3, youve made a very serious mistake.",2
"another step forward for the arma universe. the near-future setting is a put off to some, but i can get past it because it is very well done. arma ii has had a long history and took time to reach the level it is at today, but i think arma iii has more momentum and you can see mods and missions being produced at an impressive rate. vanilla arma is fun in its own right, but it is with realism mods that the game really shines. the a-10c, f-16, and su-35 mods are impressive and there is even a new release of a realism mod (the name escapes me) for arma iii as the spiritual successor to the ubiquitous ace mod for arma ii. definitely recommend this at any price.",1
"a fairly realistic military sandbox, its getting constant updates and also has some mods. i cant wait for the full game, as it will have a much larger map as well as more vehicles and gear.",1
"very fun game, physics are an improvement. altis life is one of the finest in game add-ons in history.",2
"best military shooter i have played in a long time, it also has a massive game world with more content than all of the shooters released in the last few years combined. its a must play",1
"i was promised explosions, mountian dew and doritos, but all i got was a walking sim.",1
"i just brought this today and what the  it goes down 10 dollars!!!!!!!!! give me my 10 bucks back!!!!!!",1
"full of bugs, this is glitches galore, what little content there is seems unfinished and rough. its hard to call this a game and it doesnt completely qualify as a simulator yet. there are no collision mechanics vehicles colliding with each other or some objects usually ends with one of them flying off into the distance. i wouldnt recommend this game for 60$ not even for 40$ this was released as a full game months before it should be and were still waiting on a real full release, in the mean time they havent even added any of the old vehicles or equipment there is very little hope and id say the only salvagable content is the modding community which so far has kept arma 3 alive for as long as it is though most of the people who purchased it have given up. i want my money back.",2
"one of the best pc games i have played only down sides are the optimisation is pretty bad but apart from that awesome game",2
"what? how can i write a review? i dont even have this game... -_-",1
"very fun game. espically with all the mods like, epoch, altis life and arma 3 life. all very fun if you like role play. epoch is a zombie survival game if youve played arma 2 epoch its very simular.",1
"im liking the storyline so far. first multiplayer i joined i was naked and had no weapons, no idea where i was or what to do, some guy yelling about a box shot me point blank with a sniper rifle. 10/10 oh and you run out of breath if you move forward for more than 4 seconds making aiming impossible, because thats fun.",1
"yeah i like it, its fun! want to use evey button on your kb? ...then this is the game for you. once you have things sorted out it really does kick azz. one of a kind and worth your time.",1
"my favorite game ever! altis life,breaking point",3
"this game is really good and the mods are getting better and better :)",1
"i have an 8350 clocked at 5.0 and a video card 290x twinfrozer. i score 9250 on 3dmark and this game runs like crap no matter what. on top of all this i hate the amount of control buttons this games always have. they need to make them like operation flashpoint.",1
"amazing nice game! i think arma iii can fit different kinds of players because of the wide varietty of gametypes, missions and similar. the game also has a really good modability which i really like since you can make the game to so many diffrent things. dont get me wrong though, the game is great non-modded aswell! its very fun to play with friends or just join a server and play with somone you havent met before. the game is also really awesome to play on lans, especially if youre a few and play against eachother. i strongly recommend this game, especially if you have some friends to play with. allthough if you dont, i recommend playing it anyways since it is a great way to make friends since you proabably have similar interests. if you dont have anyone to play with, you can always ask if me and my friends wanna play some. kind regards hugo , aka pierre-grt aka grtman",1
"altis life- stole a helicopter, took a man hostage, landed, got chased by the police, got captured, got charged with grand theft auto, evading police and rekless flying and got put in prison for 10 minutes... 10/10 would take hostage again...",1
"for me this game runs just fine with a steady 50 to 65 fps. im used to playing in 144 fps but that is really not a huge problem. it sadens me that so many people have problems with this game but for me, having played a little bit of everything and loving the campaign so far, it is a must buy if the game runs as it should. i do hope they fix if not all then atleast some of the issues and that they add more content so that more players can and want to experience and play this awesome game. my pc is equipped with gtx 670 ftw edition x2 (sli). so if you do have these graphic cards running windows 7 pro 64bit with latest updates and everything this game should work for you. not two pc:s are exactly identical even with the same specs so best thing is to buy the game when its on sale and with luck it works as good as it does for me or even better.",1
"lots of different game modes to keep you busy. its all about that wasteland mod though",1
"epic tactical shooter/simulation and some awesome gamemodes.",1
"great game recommend it to anyone. one of the best games i have played and graphics are amazing. many gamemodes for you to try out and dlc.",3
"i love this game. and if you ever enjoyed arma 2 at all, even with all of the little annoyances that came with it, i can guarantee you will enjoy arma 3.",1
"hello everyone thematrixman here giving my review on this fantastic game. so if you have played arma 2 this is a huge jump in the right direction. personally i didnt like arma 2 due to its crappy controls and bugs. however, i did like the big open atmosphere which arma 3 keeps and even out does it if i say do so myself. i gonna be straight out with you guys i have not beat the campaign yet because of difficulty and just lack of interest. the multiplayer is really the way to go as well as player made levels. i recomend playing capture the island for it puts this game to its max and create the intensity of a real war. overall if you are ever wanting to play cti msg me and we can frag some noobs. the commaning is really crisp and you often have to think on the fly which is great for people who like strategy like me. the a.i arent that bad as they can fly helicopters better than me, but driving is another story (psst, if you put them in relax mode they will only drive on roads). so i conclude that this game will provide you with endless entertainment and i hope to see some of you online. this is matrix signing out!",1
"really fun i dont much care for the corrupt cops on altis life or the people using mortars in wasteland or the idiots who play domination but its a fun game anyway but it sucks i bought it the day before it went on sale...",1
"you know that a game is a hard core military sim when you spend much of your time marching and griping to the co about how the chopper could have put us closer. yes it is hard core, but, with the right scenario, surprisingly accessible. game still seems in development without clear instructions on how to create scenarios and seems a little buggy, but whether that is due to bad scripting or the program itself is unclear. id pick this game up if cheap or if you know a group of people who are keen to play and have at least one person who knows how to mod and run the server. there are also plenty of arma clans out there to join if you are keen. again the game still doesnt quit feel as complete as the previous in the series but then the game is trying to do a lot and once you get in, you can still have a lot of fun.",2
"loves how it does things in real life but in a game",1
"very good game, really worth cheking out for those who got bored of the regular type shooters, and with the zeus dlc wich is free this game is worth every penny, it becomes a game with an incredible ever evolving gameplay, wich no other shooter can offer.",1
"i just started playing and im hooked.this is by far one of the best simulators ive ever played . i am recommending this game if you are into shooters. the realism of arma 3 is amazing. this is no call of duty or battlefield.",1
"great game. king of the hill is fun and you cant miss breaking point for that compleat dayz experence. could use some optomization",2
"this is such a great tactical game. you get to play with players that want to play the game as if it was in real life, so you get a truly great simulator expeirience. do i recomend? yes!!",1
"i play arma 3 since alpha, it has changed alot since first builds all in plus. its currently best game to buy if you think about tactical fps game, and also it isnt just that you buy arma and its all you get. arma 3 like arma 2 is a platform that allows modders to create completly different game modes that developers originally designed, also the game has a lot of devs attention. dlc-s like zeus make this game even more interesting and avilible even for non scripting gamer society. only thing i wish to see in future arma 3 development is more dlc (no matter if free or not if it bring lots of new stuff) and directx12 witch will help to improve performance.",2
"(mind you that its and indie game, not a triple-a title. haters.) the must-have action pc exclusive. why waste your time in a moba when you can outrun the police in a go-kart, snipe enemies from kilometers away, and take over the world mad max style? arma provides a solid base for many different kinds of gamemodes. still not convinced? go check out the workshop. (mind you that its and indie game, not a triple-a title. we all know the engine is not the greatest, but for those of you that have arma 2, arma 3s engine a huge upgrade.)",1
"like its predecessor, arma 3 really raises the bar in the gaming industry. graphics, beautiful... physics, fluid... gameplay... enagaging... you wont find a shooter like it! the number of mods is growing rapidly, and thats what really makes the arma series what they are today. as with arma 2, you are purchasing a game, with many separate games embedded for mulitplayer, or singleplayer. due to the fact that this game is full release, there are no major issues, and its only recently been available! however i would recommend waiting for a sale or buying this game elsewhere, as i do think 40 is a little steep, atleast for me.",1
"i wish i had bought this game, ;) but i oly played it on free steam day thingy ;( plz donate to me. frriend me",1
"very entertaining but has some problems such as some of the worst optimization and lack of content that they try to sell to us in dlc but is overall a good game",2
"everyone who thinks they are badarse at shooters should try this real war simulator! you aint cav you aint ....**** this is by far as close as you can get to war without going.one of the best games i own, and will never go out of style.",1
"attention: i am not reviewing arma 3 solo play. i am reviewing the online multiplayer in altis life and asylum.. first of all, let me just say that a majority of the people ive come across in this game are complete s. theyll kill you, take your stuff, harrass you, etc; all while you have your back turned. however.. the rest of the gameplay makes up for it. this is one of those games where you need friends. dont have friends? make some. it is so unbelieveably easy to make friends in this game and at that point you can actually have a promising team to get  done. you will not succeed on your own. sorry, if youre a solo player, youre gunna need a team at some point. altis life is a game mode. its fun, and theres no limit to what you can actually do. be a cop - check. be a rebel - check. be a taxi driver - check. be a paramedic - check. i love this game for the time ive played and i recommend it to anyone whos willing to die over and over, to eventually succeed.",1
"10/10 best game for players that love tema work!!!!!!!",4
"really good game. if you liked arma 2... you will like arma 3 better!",2
"why is your ing game broken??!! i try to install and it just deletes itself..",1
"hello im gona review arma 3. its a military first person shooter. this game has a pretty high learning curve with stances weapons modifications and other things. as i said this game is not your typtical shooter where u storm buildings and shoot fast firing guns.in this game u need strategy to complete missions. the guns in the game can kill people really fast so u need to be creative and not run and gunning. there is coop,singleplayer,multiplayer,even a real life altis life gamemode. i would greatly recommend this game but be careful if u havnt played a game before or havnt played a arma at all its gona be hard to learn this so u must spend some hours just to get used to the mechanics.",1
"realistic coop/multiplayer game and singleplayer offcourse, i can already tell that this game is based on teamwork and its awesome. good job bohemia!",1
"this is quite possibly the most emotional shooter ive ever played, and its not because of the campaign. crowd around, children, its story time. one day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. i was about to get in when the rockets started flying. the chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. unwilling to die before then, i rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. i entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. he explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his clan. i politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. as i finished, a ghost hawk flew over the horizon. my squad had arrived. this noble child soldier and i were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. the sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. his shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as i climbed in the transport. my new friend was dead. 10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.",2
"i found this game to be very fun and i really recommend it for people who have the time and patientce. couple things i dont like though... 1. its in the future. (i dont like futuristic games) 2. you have to pay for more snipers and helis. 3. its really hard to kill people unless they have fatigues or civi clothes on. 4. no instant death on headshots i really recommend this game and i also recommend for anyone who buys this game to get the karts dlc.",2
"while the ai can be a flaw, there are mods that fix that, and i greatly enjoy this game overall, its one of the best games ive ever played. 15/10 :3",1
"very fun game, i get some fps lag in cities, but overall, its too fun to set down.",3
"great game fantastic if you want a military sim somewhere in the near future",1
"ok time for me to get around to this. at first, coming from arma 2 vet, it was quite confusing to play seeing how control are tad bit different. however i quickly learned it was for good. you no longer need to scroll and select action menu. for simple item, you can just enter boxes, open door, pick up item just one click away. for complicated stuff, action menu is there for you. but remmeber, do use mousewheel select or youll shoot instead. haha. also gears are now inventory. so thats i not g because g will drop a nade and kill you. now for the game. i personally disliked the future theme it had going on. however, thankful for armaholic and super easy new mod system. i was able to mod the game back to current year. not 2035. i recommend getting a faction addon such as canadian force or us infantry with nato - spetsnaz weapon pack. they will make the game more better. now i am making scenario like madman and playing it. love how you can customize weapon, love how you can select gears and helmet to use. (grass helmet for the win) vanilla 4/10 with mods 20/10 also you dont need to wear pant or condom to play this.",1
"it is complete  that i can not roll back on updates, i was so excited to play arma3 with friends tonight on a hoth (mod) server now i cant play until the server updates, there is no  option to roll back or pick which update version to play on, the first big up for bohimiah! well done, you knocked the pants off that one!!!",3
"i wish this would go on sale already so i can murder my friends like ive always wanted to",1
"arma 3 has a ton of potential to becoming the all known war game well all love and play. it however suffers from major faults which are holding its absolute success back. it suffers from relatively poor performance, art and design inconsistencies, some odd game mechanics, and relatively weak visuals. bohemia interactive has a lot to work on, and no, its not going to be another vehicle dlc pack that ill be looking for.",1
"arma 3 is an amazing military simulator that treads a line between ultra realism and arcade shooter. while the strange controls and not so eazy to adapt to type of tactics may seem intimitdating. dont let that put you off. this is an amazing game. with a very powerful editor and tons of multiplayer and singleplayer scenarios on the workshop and with the game you will have a lot of fun. there is no campaign and not too many vehicles compared to the last game currently. but the devs behind this awesome game have let us know these will come in due time. (i hope they still put in capture the island)",4
"it was` free week-end` when i fall in love with this game. but i can`t aford it !",1
"this game is very intertaining. you can have lots of fun by playing the campaign or online. i find the best thing to playis the mod breaking point. this is a dayz like game that has a lot less problems. you can pick a faction each time you die and respawn.",1
"arma ii operation arrowhead  on this sad excuse of a trilogy. if call of duty or battlefield is your type of game then this ones for you.",1
"bored with the arcades? bored with no class limit fighting against 999999 snipers? skilled vehicle players that dont die with 999999 hits in their bugged hitbox. bunnie hoppers? supposed to be a co-op game, that everyones act like lone wolves? people who run, jump and aim at the same time with 999999 tons of equipment? hold your breath and come to the arma iii theres the real war simulation happens.",1
"i like arma and opf series but its biggest and biggest  every new game... bohemia have lot of work ahead ! now i cant recommend you this game, wait 1 or 2 years..then buy it, lot of bugs now :(",2
"went from shooting guys in a battle royale to driving go-karts doing time trials",1
"good game iwth weapon resting mod. i got aids and lived to tel l this tale,",3
"this is basically life, a view of our future and a great game from any perspective. i value this games smaller features as well as its larger features. this game is probably one of the best games i have ever played if i havent made this clearer above. i want to see more games based around the user other than games based around unrealistic lies of war which clearly arent fun.",2
"this is one of the best games that i got and i got a lot !!!",1
"very good game ! a must for every gamer buy it now while it is on sale :)",1
"singleplayer was ok but multiplayer was hard as hell (immpossible). the arma games get worse each release. if u want a good arma game play arma gold edition.",1
"its a great improvement compared to its predecessor arma ii. i mean, you used to die when opening a door while standing in front of it in arma ii ... new graphics and physics are looking really good. i actually get more fps with higher settings than in arma ii gameplay is alot smoother and saver now 9/10",1
"from my point of view, its still in early development, years from completion, horrible cpu and gpu-utilization (stutters constantly) not to mention bad physx performance (proprietary nightmare) lack of basic weaponry, vehicles, low-res vegetation and textures. the main campaign is full of bugs and glitches (shooting through everything without you ever having a chance spotting them) scenarios are a joke, incomplete, horrible voiceacting and bad audio quality, almost silent all the time, lack of weaponry and content (to much focus on overly expensive dlcs) and the overall experience is cheap, incomplete and you will get the feeling that the developers dont know what the  they were doing back in 2013.",2
"extremely enjoyable game but its still arma and it still has the horrible desync and lagginess. altis life is extremely good except for some servers which have lots of bandits. normal campaign is quite fun but very time consuming. the challenges are good except a bit glitchy as you cant seem to complete some of them. other than that its a very solid game that you can put many hours into!",1
"when i first got arma 3 back in alpha stage, i thought you know what this game lacks? go - karts... well alas, i jump on steam, and what do i see? arma 3 karts i thought it was blasphemy, a ruse if you will, but after throwing my money at the screen, then realising that buying things on steam doesnt work like that, i purchased the dlc. the handling is supreme, and arma 3 is now what id call a finished game. 11/10 would go-kart again",2
"they should add an rv to this game. 9/10 will update once rv is added.",1
"for the little i have gotten to play i have fallen in love with the game my problem is i keep getting a d3d error and i cant fix it so the games just quits on me but im gonna build me a better pc soon and ill just play on it",1
"if you are looking for milsim, there is no other to beat this...",2
"its a playground if you put your mind to it. lasing targets, flying jets, piloting a sumbmarine, or just firing tracers into a dark stormy night is only a grain of sand in a desert. jump in feet first and enjoy!",2
"11/10 i love this game, it has gave me so many amazing moments of epicness. (get battle royale and breaking point mods). lol and noscopes are included kbye",1
"well  yes i highly recommend this game. its so intense!!",1
"probably the best milsim game i have ever played, 10/10",3
"the game crashes to desktop as soon as i join a server and even support cant help. 35.99 for a non-functioning product. be careful with your money.",1
"this is a real review, i have been playing this since alpha release. i had this on an old steam account but got hacked so thats why my hours arent high up there but this game is amazing, the inventory system is awesome and so much better than arma 2. there are things i go back to in arma 2 so both are awesome. there is a bug right now that came recently for arma 3 in the inventory system but its uncommon to happen. if you like military simulators this is a great one to try, plus the many mods created for it so far. also there are dlc that come out for it.",1
"very fun game. some aspects like jumping and crouching even the (double zooming) is quite annoying. but the game is very fun when played with a friend or two. can recommend.",2
"how arma 3 was made: producer: oh god no.... producer 2: what is it? producer: dayz has more plays then arma 2 does and in order to get more money we need money. producer 2: i have always feared the day this would happen. producer: what could we do sir? producer 2: i know! we could make arma 3! producer: but sir pepole more would still play dayz! producer 2: your right, have the introduction in a helicopter and make the campaign really small. producer: thats fantastic sir! producer 2: wait, im not done have lots of swear words. producer: swear words sir? producer 2: yes its very odd but pepole love swear words. producer: ill be right on it sir. and thus, arma 3 was made.",3
"great game! if you played arma 2, then you have to play arma 3. even if you havent, play it for the explosions. i would seriously recommend you add this to your library.",1
"omg best game ever i played :d i recommend this game! *wasteland situation!* :d drove with friend in quad then helicopter was starting to shoot us, so we jumped out of quad and ran into forest, so my friend got injured legs so i was angry so taked out mine rpg and when he flyied under us,i shoot him, with my rpg,and they just blowed up :d then we started to loot them :d so this game is so cool!",1
"gameplay is good. but then its the arma series, the servers are not optimized properly, even with high-end hardware your bound to get low fps. until they actually get their  together and optimize the game. its a no from me :p.",1
"very confusing controls makes it difficult to play. definitely not worth 35.99 -_-",1
"really fun and tactical shooter. tons of different gamemodes to play. never gets boring",2
"bought the game excited to play it. didnt start up. tried different ways to start up, then without steam, still didnt start up. looked to get some help, did the -nobenchmark tip. the game started. played a couple hours, got off went to bed. got up, tried to run the game, doesnt start up again. even with the -nobenchmark, and different combonations of starting the game.",1

"ive been playing the series all the way back from its ofp (operation flashpoint) days, a bit over 12 years ago! what makes this game such a unique experience is its community, always creating new content for it. theres never a dull moment in arma!",1
"spent 60 dollars for this game played it alot played the alpha and beta to test the game then today got battle eye banned for no reason and cant play one of my favorite games ever, it seems like bohemia interactive is so cheap they have to use battle eye, a screwed up hacker security setup that bans people who do nothing i was on yesterday play altis life then today i get on to go play with a friend i get a ban message, they are too cheap to use vac that actually works and doesnt ban people that do nothing it bans people that do hack and break the game i have also been banned on arma 2 oa and i sent a support message to battle eye, and bohemia interactive, and then i got a bot that messaged me back saying that i need to go to steam and i did i went to steam and i got a message from one of theyre support consultants an actual person not a freaking bot i commemerate steam for this and i scould bohemia interactive and battle eye. i will be missing out on arma 3 life, city life, battle royale, and many other fun game modes because i get banned for no reason by battle eye.",2
"right ... this is one of the best/worse games ever and i say that because the gameplay experience is awesome, like no other, but all the glitches and crashes of the game just put you off playing it. i every morning try and play it and it crashes on me more than 10 times, now tell me who will have the nerve to keep on trying and trying and trying to get in and play. most of the people wouldnt even bother. i would understand the situation if my pc was crap and for that to be the reason for the game to crash, but i have a dell 8700 xps (specs under) and it still crashes on me like its nothing. 35 pounds for a broken vanilla game ... man thats outrageous ... proper daylight robbery is what it is. really pissed off ... this game could ruin your whole day, but if ... only if the game starts and you get into a server ... im telling you youd have the best 3rd person/1st person shooter/military simulator gameplay experience ever ! ... it is totally up to you if you want to got through all the bs for this game .... processor 4th generation intel core i7-4770 cpu @ 3.40ghz operating system windows 7 memory1 16gb dual channel ddr3 1600mhz - 4 dimms hard drive 2tb 7200 rpm sata hard drive",2
"its a very good game! specialy the altis life mode on some server! great game!!!!!",1
"as a member of an active clan that uses this simulator as its main recruiting tool it gives me hoursof enjoyment.",3
"it is sick, represents real military and you can do coop missions",1
"its overall not a bad game but for the price i wouldnt recommend it. pros: * beautifully detailed world spaces teeming with wildlife * extremely large maps make for fun and challenging combat as well as virtual site seeing * a nice assortment of weapons and equipment to choose from cons: * poor help system and no tutorial for new players - one was later added but it was not super useful * overly complicated and over numbered controls with a large portion of the keyboard being used as well as the mouse * poor sound effects; especially for guns * for as detailed as the world and npcs are, the guns seem to overall be lacking in both function and appearance * although certainly more realistic than most fps games, the fatigue system is a little troublesome considering how large the world is and how far you often need to travel from objective to objective without a vehicle. even walking with an average amount of gear can almost completely stop your progress fairly fast forcing you to stop and rest overall score from 0 to 10, 10 being the best: 5-6",1
"i just realized ive logged in 263+ hours into this game without giving it a review. i have adhd, so its really hard to keep my attention, especially in games, a hobby i love. let me just say. arma 3 has taken 263+ of my hours while the upcoming game has only taken 180+ of my hours. really? is there anything else i need to say about this game?",2
"i love the fact that the maps are so large, it barely crashes, and its soooooo tactical",1
"brilliant army simulator, it offers so much more than just the base game. with custom missions workshop. and fully mod-able. its deffo a good buy. amazing for co op, multiplayer and single player. a massive improvement on arma 2.",2
"good game suggest playing wasteland and altis life",1
"arma 3 is a very special game. the realism that is blended with the game really brings the game to life. the maps in the game are extremely huge, allowing for people to roam and have great battles. the gamemodes associated with arma 3 show what fun can be had. battle royale is among my favorites, where the game is a hunger-games-like survival competition. there is a variety of vehicles, including aerial and sea. the weapons have many attachments, and some have the unique trait to have tracers. overall, the game is a thrilling experience. 9/10",1
"the text wasnt showing up in the text boxes. very frustrating.",1
"the single player campaign, despite being released in episodes is one of the most immersive and exciting single player games i have played. a wide variety of missions, a storyline that that keeps you interested and obvioulsy great locations from both stratis and the huge island of altis too. if single player isnt your thing, then there is sure to be an infinite amount of co-op missions made by players and mods for the multiplayer as well that will always be entertaining. still doesnt cut it? learn to use the map editor and create your perfect scenario that you would like to play out in arma 3 either by yourself, with a mate of with all of your friends if you so desire. 9/10, definitely recommend! altis was very poorly optimised on release but it has improved a lot since then. even i can run it on medium/normal with a 560 ti and an i7 2600 at a respectable framerate in most cases. hope this helps! see you on the battlefield!",1
"this game is amazing. me and my friend were only able to do so much. however its etremly relistic. but it is very hard",3
"paid $70 for this and ive spent more time trying to figure out how to join multiplayer servers than i have even played the game: play>multiplayer>any server - - loads for a second then returns me to server list without saying why, as if it never happened before. waste of money, thanks.",1
"arma 3 is a great millatry simulator it is very in depth and i had a lot of fun with this game! one of the things that was a buying point for me was altis life it is a gamemode like cops and roobers where you can do anything from smugle drugs acrros the border to stealing cars or robbing the bank! however the main point that i like the most is how you can acoplish your objective in your own way for the campaign and the multiplayer, you want to go in head first guns balzing you can, you want to go with a stealty helicpoter insercion and some sniper support you can. this is hands down one of the best millitary simulators, and i strongly recomend this game!",3
"personally i would put this game as m game of the year if not my game of the decade, the fact is even with its flaws, bugs and the perhaps not as optimised as it could be engine...i would still recommend this to anyone who has gotten tired of the average shooter, because this isnt one. arma has alwasy been a miliary simulator and hopefully always will be and this makes the game into something that no other first person game can top. the realism is brilliant and the combat stance mechanic is something fresh offering different ways to take cover, adding new ways to be tactical. not a fan of realism and seriousness? check the workshop and armaholic. you are bound to find something that will have you laughing, crying and having a blast. after all whats not to like about racing go-karts with heavy machine guns mounted ontop? if there was one thing that does bug me its the fact that rocks...tend to eat you sometimes if you get too close so be careful with that tl;dr version: buy the game or i will make a rock swallow you 10/10",2
"buggy as all other bohemian games, also very resourse consuming. however, you can have a good time once you figure all the things out.",1
"arma 3 is a great military simulator which allows you to explore a very large map called altis and a smaller map called stratis with other players which leaves you fighting off the enemys who have control of the island. just recently bohemia servers have shut down due to steam buying out the bohemia and for some unknown reason, we arma 3 fans are still waiting for the servers to go online. it has been almost 3 months now and still no sign of the servers. this game is best when you are able to play with friends as i dont reccomend purchasing this game until bohemia interactive and steam sort out the server issues. unfortunately, arma 3 is going to be sitting in my steam library gathering cobwebs until the servers are back online.",1
"amazing game, better with friends. even though bohemia has made the game unfinished so modders can expand on i. its still the best game possable without mods that is the closest ive ever been to being back in a warzone ~a ex-military friend 11/10 would arma again (ive already got 380 hours on this too!)",3
"lots of fun, especially with friends and runs alot better then the previous installments, steam integration is also amazing. only problem is that its lacking quite alot of content compared to arma2.",1
"great open world tactical combat game. buy it and team up with some friends and kick !",5
"arma isnt like cod,bf its more like gta but more realistic, i mean you dont rly steel ppls cars you need a key/lockpick to the car and its not that easy to get money either. to get money u have to like pick apples or sell weed. it was boring when i started to play this game but it did become funnier and funnier every time. to play this game u need a lot of time i say.",1
"i extremly love this game besides the people online that can abuse thier powere i love this game and definetly reccomend it to anyone else",2
"we seriouslly dont need any explanation for this series. simply amazing and with the help of the community this get better every day, steam workshop is a dream come true for the arma series as it just make the game everlasting. from casual to hadrcore sim style gameplay, it is all here. why have you not bought this already :)",3
"took players hostage by sitting on a rock 700m away with a sniper rifle and texting them put your hands behind your head and put your gear on the floor. super fun",1
"buy it, use it, fix it, mod it, upgrade it......oh yeah buy this :) 9.5/10",2
"good for battle royale, only if its hardcore/ zeus is worth trying it is awesome in my opinion, also epoch will be released soon so a3 is worth playing!",2
"arma 3: looks like a next-gen game, plays like a game from 2001",2
"arma 3 will kick any cod or bf player straight in the privates if you try any of that run and gun bs. from being a long time battlefield fan from ps3 to pc, arma was a change of pace for me. i got sucked into dayz for arma 2 and never turned back. when i saw arma 3 coming out i knew i had to pick it up, better graphics, gameplay, map, just better everything. some do say that the parralax on the ground is annoying or the way the clouds spin with you a certian way but in all honesty, the game is some of the most fun ive had with a hyper-realistic military sandbox. very well made besides a few bugs but thats something that just kinda comes with a game of this size.",1
"if you like laughing your  off and fun, long game play... arma 3 is for you... updated review the game is still fun as hell, but still runs like",1
"arma 3 is a awesome game to play most of the community have respect and there are plenty on mod",2
"great game! just needs to fix the damage models as of the 5.56 rounds are like 9mm rounds be nice if they fix that other then that great game! p.s. get battle royale its a mod and its awesome!",1
"really fun game. but apparently when you dont play the game for about 3 months it bans you. stopped playing it just to randomly come back on one day and was banned for some reason unknown to me. i dont know how to cheat in any video game let alone a game as confusing to deal with downloads and gamemodes than arma.. anyone know what i can do?",1
"hey all, firstly game is awesome, but that one thing that has me pulling my hair off is the constant crash to desktop that this game does. it almost kind of feels like it is a extra feature. altis life rules!, (if i dont dc) still play though :) 7/10 (being generous)",1
"one of the best war simulators and could only be better if there was a dayz mod to it",1
"its very indepth and has hours of gameplay, its ai system makes it so you never fully know what will happen next.",2
"very good game with endless possibilities as well as mods but lacks good optimization. youll need a very good cpu as well as gpu to run this game on ultra with a stable 60 fps.",2
"best shooter on the market. skill, tatics and stealth all required. not just run and gun like every other shooter these days. also has a great modding community dedicated to producing good quality maps, weapons, mods, etc.....",1
"since modern warfare 2 this is the best game i have played. although i liked the call of duty francise, it has lost its way and has become a game of mindless running around chasing xp points. arma is huge, fun and needs more care to complete your objectives. although it lacks instant multiplayer gaming, there are only a few games to play, you can create your own or download one from steam, all free of charge. it took a lot of getting used to but i love it.",4
"good game, little buggy at times, but overall good, has a good community that hosts servers alot of which are fun and full of gameplay, decent amount of vehicles.",2
"amazing graphic and gameplay experience, totaly worth it !",4
"well i was driving along in stratis life and a cop texted me gg and i was kicked off and global banned..... im not hacking lol even if my account looks sus because of my vac ban my ing  brother gave me im searous i liked this game it was great then i was banned for no reason gg game. 60 dollars wasted on this .",1
"a real game for real people. the harsh learning curves are overwelmed by the rewards of a perfect assult or a mission that gos well. buy this game. learn how it works as is not like the standard fps out there at the moment. id also recomend arma 3 life. a muiltplay server that is just tops when played witht he right people.",3
"if i there was a thumbs up, thumbs down. id give it that, i sunk just about 8 hours into it. dont get me wrong, i quite like this game, the graphics, gameplay, control of the charecters are fantastic. but there are some things id like to go through: 1) ai: this is a major problem which will ruin the game, to kill an enemy, its about 4-5 shots the ai however (even on recruit, can kill you in 1-2 shots from distances at 500m from a standard assault rifle, it ruins the game completely. you cannot complete the game without dying 10+ times. this needs to be fixed, especially on the mission which are on your own. on multiplayer however,(co-op) ai is laggy and derpy at times, and are still op. 2) controls are hard to get used to, they are everywhere, num pad, f keys, behind your back etc. if you cant remember a binding, or get a control wrong, it could cost a mission faliure, there a bit clunky at times. 3) price: 35.99 (i got it for 17.99) in my opinion, a bit overpriced for what you get... but still is a very good game in conclusion, arma 3 is a great game but still needs work with ai overall i will give it 7/10",1
"this game is awesome, i once hit a tank with a hunter, blew him up and no damage to my hunter. physxs are also amazing i mean like just hit a bump in a atv and does 3 backflips and also ign rated 69/10",3

"a great game and ever evolving sandbox! i highly recommend this game.",1
"amazingly fun game, takes a bit of getting used to but once youve got it its golden. i recommend this game to everyone.",1
"very good game but you do need a decent computer to play multiplayer",5
"amazing game.good graphics life is fun, the domination is epic and i would higly recomend it. if you get it play some easteland with me on atlis (the biggest map on arma 3 which is 1/4 bigger than chenarus.",1
"this game is amazing. i played the second one as well and i can see that the third builds and improves on it ten fold. the looks, the motion, the weapons, environments, physics, and most of all the audio. i feel surrounded in the world as if i am part of it myself. i greatly approve this game with all its differences fromt its predecessors. anyone looking for a great simulator should pick up arma 3. bohemia interactive has amazed me yet again and i am so glad that they have.",2
"this game is so unoptimized it is redicolus, i want my money back !!!! i should of pirated this piece of duty. call of duty is better than this  omg my rage is gonna give me a heart attack and im gonna sue. never again will i buy an arma game again . no i dont recomend to a friend ahhhhhhhhhhghhhhhfhfdhdsfhsdhfhsd",1
"the game itself is remarkable. arma2 + much better graphics. the mechanics require some getting used to, but the gameplay is fun and very realistic. excellent combat simulator. if you are not used to combat sims, there is a steep learning curve, but it is much easier to learn than in arma 2. the action and movement mechanics are much more fluid. once you get bored of singleplayer there is multiplayer involving co-op (team up with others to complete objectives), wasteland (join one of 2 factions, or go at it alone on island, surviving and killing others), and a plethora of scenarios and mods to play with. most of my gametime is currently on the breaking point mod. the mod gives an unique experience than just normal multiplayer. you will have to use tatics and strategy to survive from zombies, nature, and other hostile players. i had this game since alpha release and it is a must get if you loved arma ii and dayz. if you want a realistic, tatical shooter, this is it. no call of duty, counter-strike, battlefield  here. beware you will need (cpu) processing power to run this game. gpu power not so much.",3

"it does have a better physics engine than arma: 2/ao, but this is somekind more a for fun, not to serious about war. it does have a lot of mods, but it does not seems that they are that good. like, seriously. a go-kart, in a war. does not seems to realistic, but i do like the zeus addon. i would give it 8/10, because it does not have the war feature i want. well, i would recommend this to clans and stuff. who wants their own server, and make some war!",1
"this game is good for people who like fun, in realistic way. all fights are not so big but a lot more realistic. lots of gamemodes guns and stuff you can do in this game is just awesome, and i like it because its just thing, that hasnt been done yet by anyone else. (not saying dayz is not too good)",1
"best military sim and most interesting mods for one there is. recommend!",1

"i had got addicted to arma 2 combined operations before this game. the semi-futureistic feel this game has did not grab me at first, by after a while i loved it. great game for modding also, in-fact, it is so good for modding that my mod folder is now more than 3 times the size of the game folder. bohemia interactive did a very good job on this game, i recommend. i give it a 9.5/10. p.s. do not stand on jagged rocks or rubble - the result is not favourable.",3
"not for the light hearted. if youre looking for an easy game/shooter, this is not the one for you. arma iii incorporates aesthetically realistic and functionally sound elements which require not only multifaceted operation but also reticulated execution as such. arma iii caters to the serious gamers who adhere well to solidarity in teamwork and efficacy in realistic measures. with various elements in play such as air support in many forms, ground armour and true ballistics, one needs to be on their top game to prosper in the battlefield of arma 3.",5
"this game is an absolute must for anyone who enjoys tactical gameplay! on top of having amazing graphics it has a an amazing mission editor making it easy to make your own missions and keeps the game from getting dull. just like in arma 2 the relaism is still unsurpassed and truly amazing conpared to any other game out there. many co-op servers are full of serious tactical gamers keep the feel and realism alive in game as you play. a lot of the mods that were popular in arma 2 have carried over, minus dayz because of their new standalone being publicly available now. plenty of active servers to play on as well as endless amounts of tactical gaming communities or even just small groups of regulars that are friendly. just like on arma 2, communication still is a must in the co-ops also you just wont get the full experience this game has to offer if you don`t have a mic, nothing like using different, in game, radio channels to ask for help or ask for an evac. this is a great move forward for the arma series and will only continue to get better with possible add-ons as well as an ever growing and active community pouring in endless amounts of mods and missions.",1
"definitely the best tactical shooter and shooter in general in the last decade. it is very immersive in that you have so many different controls at your disposal which is a little tedious at first but once you learn them you will be wishing every shooter had them. its very realistic in that you can only survice about 2-3 shots from a rifle. you can zero your scopes to get perfect shots from a distance. 1st and 3rd person views allow for very tactical gameplay. you can pilot jets and helicopters, drive tanks and transport vehilces, or dominate on foot. the maps are massive allowing for very intense wide scale (or small) fire fights. the mods alone make this game worth getting. so many different game modes available to play thanks to the modding community for this game. absolutely worth every penny. if you like slower paced, tactical shooters this is your game! lone wolf or team up, both excel in this game.",1
"if you want a challenging game, with a great community and a stupidly fun editor then buy this game",1
"realithtic militarie thimulator... no, dont buy this turd. its another broken buggy piece of unoptimized garbage made by bohemia interactive.",1
"great game without mods. even better with mods! my favorite mods are tfar and acre!",5
"lets start off by saying that, this game is great. totaly worth all the money. now this games does have its flaws. the controls are hard to get used to, almost every key on the keyboard is used for something, or multiple things. also the game engine is broken. if you want this game you need to have one heack of a pc. on single player, full graphics, usually runs nice for me. i do have a gtx geforce 660 ti and a 4.33 ghz prosseser. but sometimes on single player, there are massive framerate drops. on multiplayer, running as low as this game goes, im getting about 20-30 fps. but not always. and now lets get to some more good things. the vide and screen shots dont seem to capture what this game can really do. you can build your own battles, so much to do in multiplayer like regular battles to survivals to get a jjob make money and live your life out with the need to buy guns and fight the rebles and the cops, or be a reble or a cop. the underwater diving and submariens are fun. there is litearaly so so so many gear types, clothes back packs guns attachments, and alot more. so yes, i do highly recomend this game, but only if you have the pc for it.",1
"ran for barely a minute, couldnt run anymore. 10/10",2
"great game; i would love an rpg (role playing not rocket propelled) experience.",3
"the friendly a.i. has the marksmanship of a drunk stormtrooper, the enemys on the other hand are apparently sf. 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10",2
"arma 3 is the best game i have ever played it just looks so real my fav part is you can play as a cop on multiplayer and its a good roleplay game for you know stuff",1
"this is the perfect game for people who have always taken themselves to seriously when playing shooters, and casuals alike. its hard to pick up but once you get the hang of the shootsing mechanic and slight lag issues, kills become very satisfying,",1
"one of the most beautiful games ive ever played, and one of the most challenging. arma iii is an essential game for any would-be fps player as it exclusively immerses the player and requires co ordination and immense teamwork. i recommend it simply because it is a beautiful game.",1
"i thought a snake was going to bite me so i jumped up got shot in the face somehow lived only to be killed by apb. 11/10 the chem lights are pretty.",1
"fun game but i only get a max fps of 50 and under when playing this online..... 3 stars",1
"the game is very overpriced but if youre a fan of military simulator you should buy it",1
"children play call of duty boys play battlefield men play arma",1
"i can just say this game has no real physics... if you play it enough you will hear the term armad meaning you fell off some steps and broke your legs or you crashed into a small bush and your truck blows up... if they put forth the effort for real physics then i would give them a thumbs up.",1
"fun game, has a different feel to arma 2. just make sure you have a graphics card that will run it well.",1
"my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game, ever. were on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. im leading a team of 4 men. we come to a crossroad and i sprint across, telling my men to hold back. i cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. nothing. i run, my saw gunner runs, my medic runs. but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across. anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through? remember the sniper scene? the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down. he then takes two more in the chest. the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. he screams as hes being shot. crawling, drenched in his own blood. sarge? you aint leaving me out here like this, right? i-i wanna go with you guys! cmon sarge, h-help me! cmon! please dont leave me! he died after that. i cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.",2
"really nice game make sure that you do have the. recommended specs since if you dont your disk percentage goes 0-100 real quick. no pun intended nice game 100% love it",1
"boss game, campaigns are really good so far... would recommend... the editor is the best thing.",1
"very good war simulation. no game for fps friends with a lot of action as bf3 or cod. man must play with brains.",3
"not a game for the casual shooter. slow and steady is the key as this is a simulator, not an arcade game. those who love combat realism will love this. with realistic physics, there is a lot to do in this simulator.",1
"like skyrim with iranian soldiers that 420 noscope you from a 1km with a 9mm pistol they used their  to shoot with.",1
"major improvements over arma 2. set in the future of 2034, there are new weapons, vehicles, aircraft, and factions. the graphics are incredible, with all-new stance positions to adapt to cover or conceal yourself. there are two new maps: stratis, a 20 km squared military island, and altis, 270 km squared island that gives us the biggest map of the armed assault series. you will be able to do everything like in arma 2 and arma 2: oa, such as zeroing, sniping, flying, operating, etc. what you will be able to do that you couldnt do is scuba diving. there is a more easier inventory system rather than slots there is the amount of space you have. its just a great game; highly recommended.",1
"pretty amazing game lots of addons and user made missions to play would reccomend 10/10",2
"shot ten people with an lmg without any pants or shirt on 10/10",1
"fun fact: 1 in 3 soldiers goes to war without packing any pants.",1
"i really enjoy this game .. its very intense but makes you appreciate simulators and fpss.. i have clocked so many hrs into this game that i could have completed real basic training. i recommend you get your friends together for a week of infantry training before you try to break your kill streak record .. this is not call of duty prepare for the real thing..",3
"great game... buy it. no regret. multiplayer server is crowded with enthusiast people...",1
"this game is great but be ready to spend hours finding loot",2
"its awsome! and i love the music and the graphics. this is my number 1 favorite game.",1
"mainly played the mods that are avaliable. @dayafter epoch mod. they are great mods epoch is still early days but coming along great. just waiting for to update xd",1
"im not a massive fps gamer, but then, i dont really count this game as a fps. its not like battlefied, cod or any of those types of titles. this is a combat simulator, and i have been immidiately impressed with the single player campaign (which i normally dont play!). the game doesnt feel as responsive as some newer titles (bf4), but its realism to me, seems excellent. i dont know of course, ive never been in a war, and hope i never have too - but playing this game makes me feel about as close as id want to get. i only started playing this game really after playing dayz standalone, and will definately be continuing the explore it further.",1
"unbelievable game , its the best fps game i have ever seen in my life and with the awesome mods , :) i cant even speak , the game will talk about it self if u buy it",2
"this game is amazing. straight up no ifs ands or buts about it. it does fall short in some areas compared to previous titles, for example the vehicle selection is tiny compared to arma2 but this will likely change over the course of the games life as bi is releasing new content in sections like the campaign. then of course there are the myriad of mods to tide you over :). if youre at all into milsim or hardcore fps games youre probably going to love this. the games biggest strength is simply that you can do almost anything you want to in it. you want to drive into the target area with a sub, swim to shore and rise out of the water like a navy s.e.a.l? you can do that. want to fly in in an ah-6 loaded for bear? you can do that, want to fly a jet? drive a tank? skydive? attack at night? use a mortar? be a sniper? fly an attack heli? or just go in as a footsoldier? arma 3s got you covered. its as it is advertised...the ultimate military sandbox. probably going to be my favourite or one of my favourite games of 2013 and 2014 especially in terms of longevity.",1
"bruh just bought this game and it goes 50% off next day... , buy it tho",1
"best game ever!!!!! everyonee needs this game in their life!",2
"so i cant join hardly any servers. i can join some wasteland and altis life but when i try joining battleroyale it will not let me join. i have the arma 3 kart dlc. most servers also have a yellow question mark on them, not sure what it means. i bought arma for the multiplayer. really upset it costed $60 and i cant even enjoy the best part about the game. the campaign only lasted a couple hours. the ai will sometimes insant headshot you from across the entire island randomly, ruining the experience of the game. commanding your squad is so frustrating at times too. alot of things in this game are just not worth the money. very dissapointed. if you know how to fix the server issue please reply!",1
"some of the engagements you will get into on this game, other games like battlefield attempt to pull off but do not come close to feel at all realistic as it does in this game, would definitely reccomend",3
"the military sim with many many possibilitys, mods like dayz, mmo like survival games wastelands and many many more. the only drawback is the specs you need to get everything out of this game, with decent specs you get your moneys worth but if you have a very very nice pc you get amazing sights a couple of miles/km out.",1
"oh soso good :3 this is one of the best games of forever :d 10/10 ign kinda good i guess",1
"this is a fun filled game full of many game modes and what to play with friends. this is hard to learn for new comers with all the stat and controls but you can learn it over a hour or two. this is a good buy if you have friends , i have a hard time playing this game alone for lone hours but i can make so much fun out of this game. i recommed this game if you have friends buying or has it all ready. have a great day and sorry for my grammer :)))))",1
"great and hooking game that keeps you engaged. if youre looking for a war simulator, youve found it.",1
"if you loved its predecessors, this game is a must have. bis have stayed true to the original arma, and delivered an incredibly pretty simulator with endless replayability and possibilities.",3
"amazing game, plan on playing for hours at a time.",1
"trained soldier jumps over wall, drops 3 feet, dies. 10/10 for totes realism. srsly tho, i had competetive jumping off  w/ my friends when i was in 3rd grade and dropped farther.",1
"probably the best purchase of a game ive made in a long time. theres so many different modes, there is literally something for everyone. picture this: youre moving forward as a patrol, scanning the area of rakka as you walk the dusty roads in a collumn. suddenly, tracer fire flies right by you, and your ic is hit, the combat medic crawls to him, but suddenly he is hit as well. youve got a choice: drag either of them to safety and patch them up, or dive for cover. being a hero, you naturally grab your medic, with the intent of reviving him and getting to the ic asap. however, some dumb er in truck comes screaming up the road, stops next to you to help. he doesnt. the enemy cas locks on to the active hunter, and lets off rocket-powered fury. your screen goes red, in the bottom left: [5r] sergeantplant was killed. its all good though, you respawn and set off on another patrol. seriously though, buy this game, it is so varied, and theres so many mods available as well. the community is brilliant, both in clans and on forums like reddit.",1
"really enjoy this game. dont really play it much, but i still recommend it.",1
"this is war! if you like military simulation games this is worth your money.",3
"its just the best shooter ive ever played the graphics are awesome the game play is realistic as a fps could ever be it is the pub stomber of bf4 n cod what ever number or  name there up too",1
"why why why is this game so lagy i get 14 fps and i have a i7 4790k @ 4.7ghz and a msi r9 285 if i put all max i get like 14 to 40 fps on a good sever but wen i put all low i get 14 to 40 fps like wtf why is this game so bad like what do i need my pc cost 1,700$ like really and yall see why ppl go to consols fix this my god you have a very nice game and ppl still play it even if they only get 14 fps with the top of the line hardware this is ridiculous.",2
"if you want a true military simulator, then this is the game for you! even if you are not really into shooting and combat, there are soo many aircraft and vehicles to fly/drive arround. and if you go to mod sites such as armaholic, then the possiblilities are endless.",2
"where are the jets. i bought this soley for the jets",1
"this game was released in september 2013 without a single player campaign. part 1 of 3 dlc s to add it was released in october. its now christmas and and whilst there has been other updates for multiplayer, the final 2 dlcs that add the missing single player campaign are no where in sight.... it will probably be years before we see them and the fan boys will consider that good service.... personally i do not.... my advice... save your money for something else.",1
"where the battlefield series should have naturally progressed to; a huge multi-faceted, vehicle crammed blood bath with a fantastic community (for the most part). thankfully this beat battlefield to it so we dont have to deal with ea to play!",3
"this game demo i tried was a bit too hard in the beginning and you really need to be good or try like 20 times to make it! but it was nice graphics and fun game! recommended for good fps players",1
"man, game is great, multiplayer is fun. only its missing warfare mode in mp.. from arma 2 .",3
"arma iii is an infantry simulation more hardcore than than cod black ops or bf3. im looking forward to playing in more team-oriented groups, rather than a bunch of lone wolves. dslyecxis tactical techniques and procedures guide is well written, team oriented, and aimed at the best player experience, rather than obsessive fidelity to actual ops. also check out his youtube channel for game videos of large scale missions.",5
"i love hand cuffing people and making them bow down and kiss my feet.",1
"great game 8/10 but servers are  as . need optimization bad.",1
"abosolute must! this game is so fun in so many ways! you should definitely try it!",5
"the game does have some pretty minor glitches but other than that arma 3 is a great game for community development. devs out there create some pretty fantastic mods and addons for the games because of the huge open world maps and functions bohemia interactive provides in arma 3. many people buy this game just for the amazing addons to the game which allow very unpredictable scenarios to happen. arma is intriguing to me because the game is unpredictable. games that are unpredictable are more of a way for players to choose how they play and gives a slight immersion. there can be scenarios where you see a heli crash onto a building which is 100 meters away and that building had one of your best soldiers now knocked out waiting to ambush the enemy who is surrounded with opfor. what do you do? arma is fantastic because its your choice of how you want to play the game where other games have straight up orders to do stuff, why would you want to do that? i would give this game a 9/10",3
"great game, i love the game, and i fell in love the game mode rpg, on projectnarnias rpg server, its nice and good staff",1
"best milsim out there yet. truly recommend it! great game for those interested in teamwork play and so on :d",4
"its gorgeous, i love the feel, it can be very engaging. but even if youre a patient, not-run-and-gun player, it still can often feels like a puzzle game, trying to figure out the best way to solve the current problem. if thats your thing, great! if not, move along.",1
"a very recent purchase of mine. it is overall a great game with many amazing features. then after you get kinda good on the campaign, you can take place in the anal penetration that is multiplayer.",1
"in my opinion, its not optimized for the pc, but if you have a beast pc and you like realistic war games get it.",1
"its a good game. though recommeded for people who like to take millitary shooters very seriously. otherwise the fun side its pretty",5
"good game, but min requirements are a ing joke! my pc out specs the recomended, and my friends out specs mine and i can bearly get 10 fps on any server. and he has issues with 20 fps. please optimize your damn game! i cant even play this anymore!! when it first came to alpha on steam i had easy the 60fps i wanted! i had not an issue with the game at all then it got ing rushed to release and all the fetaures that should come with the game are paid dlc, 16$ dollars for 2 ing helos? gawd damn! what is this ing ea? and sims? what next? running dlc? where you cannot run without the dlc? jezzzus. please fix this damn game or refund my ing 60$! - i do recomend this game, but take this as a warning! its fun, and nice to play, but please steal an alien space craft from area 51 if you want anything over 8 fps. - for those who ask about pc specs. i can handle bf4 maxed 120 fps. and such on other games. i have an amd processor and graphics card.",1
"with visually stunning graphics and endless posibilities in the mission editor, arma has given my friends and i countless fun since its release. while the controls may be a bit combersome and the aiming a bit shaky, it is quickly forgotten when those intense firefights breakout. hundreds of mods on armaholic provide loads of free addons, making the game into anything whether it be the revolutionary war, wwii, iraq & afghanistan wars, or even some futuristic battle in the mediterranean sea. content although lacking from the initial release is stil being added and once again the mods make up for it. the game is so versitile it truly is unmatched on the market place. i would highly reccomend the game to anyone who enjoys a much more tactical and open environment fps rather than your typical paintball style play.",2
"its still working on its multiplayer synchronizing but has a fun system to play at. for those who dont know its based on the future not the modern military today so if you wondering where your m4 is at, it aint here. overall a fun experience for those who enjoy military-based games (or rp).",2
"metascore doesnt do this justice. if youre wired to get involved with a simulator/game like arma3, youre in for some good stuff... be prepared for hours of mission creation editing for minutes of damn that was cool. when you start scripting and remotely enjoy it...now youre !@#$ cause youre hooked for more hours of editing for minutes of damn that actually worked...awesome! once you start subscribing and playing missions created by other seasoned ameture/big league arma editors, then youre like that was !@#$ insane and you realize you dont know !@#$ about editing yet. you might as well tack on another few hours, cause youre back to the drawing board enhancing and creating more missions. great game gents! 11/10",5
"this game is not in the least bit enjoyable. graphics are really good, but everything from sound to gameplay is straightout of 1995. its buggy, half of the features dont work correctly, and the community is absent. on a saturday afternoon there are maybe 2 full servers at best. i think this stems from terribly boring gameplay, you dont see another player for hours and the community is no help whatsoever. all they say is herp derp go play call of duty if you want something enjoyable to play save your money.",1
"thought about buying this for a long time. arma 2 was great, but i wasnt sure if this was any good. if you havent played arma 3, buy it now. you wont believe what kind of situations occur there.",1
"if you like realistic war games, this has to be yours!!",1
"if you wanted to get into arma 2 but couldnt because of the janky controls, this is for you. wide selection of gametypes and servers, solid gameplay, tonnes of varied community missons. 10/10 woodbang.",1
"best war simulator out there. needs a lot of polishing though! also it feels a little alien with all the futuristic weapons. would have been nice with present weapons. luckily there is a very active modding community that is very skilled. a most have game in my opionion.",5
"alpha was fun. beta was fun. release was fun. 10/10 open world military infantry sim, loving every moment my computer can handle running it.",1
"arma 3 is the new age tactical shooter with more addons to enhance your game.",2
"this game. youre gonna die on a hill becuase your -,  character cant even jog on a damn hill.  that , and  bohemia for this stupid-,  game.  dayz also.",1
"this is a awesome game! its a army simulation based game with no white dot on the screen to help you hip fire, you wont be seeing much of that. the vehicles are smooth with a steady internet connection. i would recommend that you practice your flying skills on single player to get the hang of it so when your in battle with 8 guys in the back you know what your doing.",2
"sure there are bugs, many bugs, but the bottom line is that arma 3 improves in almost every department over the second game. well worth the dollar.",1
"only if you are max operator can you fully understand and enjoy this",1
"10/10 best game i ever bought - easily. this game has so many variations its incredible. dont take my word for it.. youtube these just for starters - arma 3 epochmod arma 3 wasteland arma 3 altis life rpg arma 3 duws arma 3 antistasi altis thats the mods ive been playing, the base game is great but these player made mods just blow it out the water. it is without hesitation, the best 17.99 i ever spent in my life, you need this in your life :)",3
"meh, its good. allows for some fun on gamemodes such as king of the hill and wasteland. but, arma 2 for life.",2
"a good soldier is fast, accurate and effective in dealing with his weapons - all weapons in arma 3 have realistic ballistics and handling. adjust your weapon to compensate for the bullet drop, go into a squat or on the floor to reduce the recoil, and fire at short intervals in order to reduce scattering of ammunition. if you do not observe these points, your opponent has easier time to gain the upper hand. with 270 km , the island altis is the real star in arma 3 from large-scale cities over rolling hills to wind and solar farms - regardless of whether the layers flattened rolls with your tank in the south or cause an asymmetric war of the hills in the north, the landscape of altis offers extremely detailed locations with numerous combat options. one of the best military simulators at the time, along with the stunning new engine, and the variety of mods a good game. 79/100",1
"why is there no furniture in the game? like all the houses are emtpy, the most you see is a bench really.",2
"this game makes u feel like its the real deal this is a great game",3
"the anti-cheat system they work with is battleye, and if you dont want to waste your money on a good game that works with the test anti-cheat organisation that is going to global bann you off dayz and this for no reason, then dont. but if you do, risk losing 60 bucks and get globally banned by battleye! :)",3
"way more fun than arma2 but still as realistic as you expect. long range, slower than normal (for a game) pace, full spectrum war game. definitely worth it.",1
"men play arma. this is a very fun game and is really fun to play with friends.",2
"this game is one of the best games i ever played but i highly suggest get a high end computer for playing multiplayer. but if you like tactical shooter games with 1st person/ 3rd person this is the one to get.",1
"reccommended for high end pcs and a stable internet connection. low end pcs can still enjoy the game.",1
"good this is a good game, great graphics, id tap it!",1
"i got this for $20 with early access and it was definitely worth the money. if youre looking for a military simulator, youve probably already heard of arma, the best military simulator out there for the public. if youre looking for something more realistic than battlefield or even insurgency, this is what youre looking for. thanks to the new helicopter flight update, its essentially/almost a flight simulator as well, as they took parts of their actual flight simulator game engine and put them into arma 3. i dont know if i could say i would recommend purchasing it for $60, but for half off, id go for it.",1
"terrific graphics for the people who have the system requirements, ((underneath the game-page)) - incredible military multiplayer experience that offers the player a variety of options to explore their time in arma 3.",1
"great game. a must buy for anyone looking for a great simulation first and or third person shooter. overall great game you will not be disappointed.",1
"arma 3 captivates you and draws you in with its beautiful graphics and scenery. arma 3 has many different gamemodes from roleplaying an african drug lord to blowing the  out of a military base. 10/10 in my opinion",2
"while crawling at the amazing forest enjoying sights youre spotting an enemy in a bush 5 meters from you. youre making a 3 well-placed shots right into his unprotected face from your heavily modded fictional mxc(whatever that means). blood animation confirms that youve been successful. enemy runs into the other bushes. he probably heavily injured.. this is what arma3 is. unpolished, unfinished game with fictional weapons on a map that makes you feel yourself an alien. they should really expanded eastern europe theme instead = arma 2 wasteland > arma 3 wasteland",1
"this is a truely good game that will take hours of your life. you can play the campaign wich is fun but you can also play the multiplayer that has all from user generated funny stuff too realy realistick battels/missions",1
"it is different from arma 2 but youll have a lot of fun playing this game! :d",1
"the game is great . good fun if you ask me . nice game modes such as altis life or wasteland. 8/10",1
"this game will lagg if you dont have a good graphics card or have a good hard drive so watch out and have fun!!!",2
"great game! even without mods this games campain and coop missions are very fun to go through. pros: - amazing graphics - great campain - massive mod support with custom gamemodes - loads of customization - extreme realism cons: - very demanding game(just having the minimum requirements probably wont cut it) - not worth full price(if it came 25-50% off it would be a good buy) - need to mess around with network ports for a private multiplayer with friends (many tutorials on this). overall aslong as you have a decent computer/laptop and the game has a price drop then i fully recommend this game.",1
"the arma series is the best by far. in my opinion no game can top it for simulation or realism. arma 3 could do better tho. (no offence)... ... ... as it says in the description experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox.... i would love to have arma 3 go a little bit more into detail with some aspects of the game. but becides that it is amazing. i would recommend this game to anyone who like military games. if ur a cod or battlefeild (which i am but not as much as arma 3) fan watch out because arma 3 is the next big thing. > profile name <, game on!",3
"one of the best first-person shooter games ive played in my life! its also fun, and realistic, so is it worth the money, oh, hell yea!",1
"awesome game!!! i play this after a hard day at work. recommended",1
"this game is very fun, but battle eye is a pain. they globally banned me for my cd key being stolen and my account was used for hacking. they told me it was my own fault for get my account hacked and my cd stolen. battle eye is a horrible company and i have no idea why any one uses their serves. if i was you i wouldnt get the game because you will probably get banned in the next week and waste $60. this game is not worth your time or your money.",1
"this game is absolutely beautiful. some of my best moments have been on this game, not only is the vanilla game absolutely brilliant but the modding community is also spectacular. you can play as marines, army, navy, whatever you choose. that being said, some further optomization is necessary as this game has major lag spikes and crazy fps drops, even in singleplayer. i have played for 300 hours and have yet to play the campaign, its great. if you are wondering what this game requires graphics card wise, i am playing with a msi radeon r9 270x which is a mid range card, on all ultra at average of 50-60 fps (on singleplayer). for a long time i was playing with a nvidia geforce 610 which is a low end card but wsa still able to play and had great expierences with. so overall, no matter what your specs are, buy this game. if your specs arent quite good enough to run it on ultra or high the sheer gameplay expierences will make you want to invest mor time, and of course more money on pc games. gameplay 10/10 graphics 9/10 fps 7/10 storyline (from what ive seen from others and from the few missions i have dabbled in) 9/10 overall 9/10 would play",5
"i drove a go-cart, and ran somebody over. rating: 10/10",1
"fell off two story building, broke my legs crawled for half an hour and begged to be killed. finally someone granted me mercy and shot me in the head - 10/10 would do again",1
"really great game! much realistic, very deaths. but seriously! this game is the most realistic fps! it only takes a few shot to die. you definitely are not arnold schwarzneger (terminator), sylvester (rambo) or daniel craig (james bond). it has very hard singleplayer missions. maybe its because i usually act like terminator and try to run in everyones face with my assault rifle... dunno.. feels realistic.",1

"if you are a millitary nut or a hardcore bf3 nut arma 3 is a no thinker, this is one of the best games that iv had the plesure of playng this year, the developer poured there love and enery into this game and with workshop adding in more guns/modes/ect it will continue to wow.",1

"this game is the best game ever. with all the moding opportunities you can make this game whatever you want. i do however strongly recommend joining a group or clan to play this game. best experienced with serious players. 5/5",1
"comparable to minecraft in its diversity and modability while maintaining a smooth and beautiful mechanic and graphic theme. endless options for modding but also includes a campaign and scenarios for people uninterested in mods. once youve played arma 3, all first person shooters seem to be lacking depth. i highly recommend this game.",4
"so far i love this game its so real and thats what alot of fps games are missing",1
"realistic combat sim and overall i really good game with great graphics",1
"probably the greatest fps game ever created. completely unlike all other fps (cod, bf etc) though. awesome graphics, awesome gameplay and awesome realism.",2
"arma 3 is like a sandbox but instead of sand its full of heavy rocks and sharp objects. the game runs poorly on most computers and is needlessly complex. unless you want to read an encyclopedias worth of information and install mods the online is dreadfully boring. however, if youre willing to put anywhere between 2-10 hours learning how the game works and experimenting you can have a  of a fun. with the money youre spending theres no reason you should not give it that opportunity. stop being lazy.",1
"i will never ever buy another mistake (bohemia interactive game). i trusted this company and purchased this game in alpha. not only did they deliver a buggy failure. they have the nerve of releasing expensive dlcs that are meant to be included in the game. and announcing new games when they havent even finished whats on their plate. this developer should be renamed as ea v2.1 never again bi, never again.",2
"this game runs at about 10-25 fps in the cities and unless you have a great pc this game will litterally be unplayable dont get it its not worht 60 dollups in any way the only time it is good is when you and your friends play either the most grindy rp mod that is pretty good becasue of its already built cities and vehichles or you can play the king of the hill gamemode with 5-15 fps and not see a single person until you open fire and miss them a million times, because you didnt steady your shot while laying down the only real way to kill someone in this game is by walking up to their face with a full auto gun and unloading on them. overall the game should not be bought until it is on sale for atleast 20 dollups off.",1
"bought it back in april, pretty bad. gave it another shot in january, holy  it is good. the custom maps and content are amazingly fun and the campaign seems pretty good as well. the games controls are horrifyingly complex and non-intuitive and the game intself can be a little buggy seeming but the combat realism and graphics are so sexy. no shooter in recent years has provided me with the proper fear of that unseen sniper 800m+ away that arma 3 has. 9/10",2
"way better than battlefield 3 and arma 2. it plays smooth, it feels right. just. ing. awesome.",2
"this is one of those games that is very hard. (thats what she said). but anywho this game is worth it. no only is it every going to cease to be fun, but it has infinte replayabliaty. only 1 con is that the weapon sway is hard to get use to. 9/10",1
"i can really recommend this game, its just awesome for so many reasons !! :d",1
"i stoped playing other games like battlefield,cod ect after i started playing arma 3 best game real war game , what i really dont like in this game low fps on most of the servers more then 40 players on very high setting. its drop my fps even if u have very powerfull pc.... u wont able to get more then 25 to 30 fps on very high settings on multiplay server more then 4o player my system spics are processor i5 4670 (cooler master seidon 120 v) graphics gtx 660 4gb ram 500 gb 750watts power supply. i hope bohemia interactive will sort out this issue ...",4

"im a new commer to arma. bought the alpha back in march i think. its not an easy game to learn but it delivers some incrediblly satisfying moments if your patient to wait and play the game the way it was ment to be played. the graphics are really really good. can play on high settings with my gtx 570. the steam workshop missions are awesome, some are as simple as a simple rescue mission or a destroying a convoy all the way up to being in charge of over 100 soilders, helicopters, drones, and tanks taking over 3-4 towns down a highway to the main airfield on altis. this game is awesome.",1

"if you are looking for a military themed game where you are not spawn killed and can have more than five seconds before being slaughterd then you have come to the right place. firstly, this game is not only intense and action packed but requires a certain amount of teamwork and co-ordination. if you do not have a mic then there may be a problem if you wish to have a good time online but singleplayer is also great too. when i first saw this game i was not too sure but after watching a couple of youtubers play this game(frankieonpcin1080p and jackfrags) i decided that this game is a must have. if you are a fan of dayz and either you cannot afford it or cannot access the game then you can play breaking point( a mod which is parallel to dayz) through arma 3 which is great fun and i found myself ensconsed for hours on end with that mod. also, if you are no a fan of the military games than this game offers you lots of less military mods, for example, arma 3 life- this mod simulates what life is like and you canplay this all through arma 3. as arma 3 has a 50% off offer i would highly reccomend investind some money into this game as it is truly just a great game. i have had a lot of fun and a lot of ours.",1
"great game, amazing graphics, great gunplay so generally an amazing game.",1
"i shot a bunny at 1150m with a .50cal, totally recomend this game",1
"its like gta but in a military way. - the map is ing huge! i never seen anything like this in anygame i also like how you can build your own forts and hold your territory and stop enemies from getting past ya by placing walls around your area and also place military cargo towers and have you and your fellow sniper team mates go on top of them and look around for any traspassers game has so many choices of misc, items and weapon attachments and many tools and resources and the cars are good too! but also you dont have to play in a military style if you want, you can play as a normal citizen man and do your everyday life story! there is nothing to complain about because this game is ing great. i run this game on very high and i get 25 to 50 fps, i had no problem at all with bugs so far. this game hass amazing graphics, the textures look amazing, the models look very nice, the effects, lights and shading look very realistic! best graphics on a open world game so far for me graphics 10/10 gameplay 9/10 map 9/10 weapons 8/10 worth the $ bought this for 30$ when it was on sale. buy it if you havent",1

"arma 3 is definitely more improved than arma 2, the experience is much better and the graphics has improved and the maps seem to be bigger. however to play it with at least 30fps or higher, you need a supercomputer to do so as this game is horribly optimised. here is a comparision of my frame rates playing different games battlefield 4 - 70fps (ultra settings) tomb raider - 120fps (ultra settings) arma 3 - 40 fps (standard settings) the graphics of this game is comparable to tomb raider. verdict: dont buy it unless you own a supercomputer.",1
"soo realistic that i cant tell the difference with real life and the game.",1
"great shooter. i have to say its definitely not one of your generic fps games (a.k.a. battlefield, cod, etc.) and it takes realism to a whole new level. id say it gets about a 9.5/10.",1
"if you enjoy military simulators, and fps then this game is for you. with the addons and packs available from the community you can turn this already very realistic and pleasurable milsim into the ultimate simulator for realistic combat situations. visually stunning when on full settings, this latest version of arma brings the series into the future. bringing with it a much better optimised engine and excellent looking visuals. with a literally infinite amount of missions to complete it both single and multi player the fun literally, never ends.",2
"this game is epic, if youre a battlefield or cod troll then i suggest you move on to something like sims. dont waste your time on campaign mode, get yourself onto multiple player, find a clan, get on ts, and trust me you wont look back. see you on the battlefield es",5
"arma 3 is a game like no other that i have ever played. the fact that this game supports the community workshop will only increase the value and fun that you can have in this game. there are an amplitude of scenarios and missions that can be done and will have you pulling all nighters quite a bit. probably one of the most popular missions files that are available is alits life which is an rpg gamemode where you can either be a cop,rebel or normal civ. there are hundreds more missions to be played and this game has gone above and beyond my hopes and expectations of what this game would be. 20/10.",2
"i highly recommend arma 3 on sale. arma 3 has a learning curve bit of a learning, but is unlike any shooter on the market. arma 3 is a bit buggy, so expect rage inducing lag and glitches from time to time. turst me booboo, its most likely not your pc set up. with all the mods and servers that this game features, you are guaranteed to get countless hours of game play out of this game. the campaign story is laughable, but the ai is challenging if youre completionist. buy this game if you like: great gun play teamwork realistic firefights flying helicopters or jets survival mods fighting ai with your buddies pvp with a /steep/ learning curve pass on arma 3 if you dont like: large keybind layouts low framerates working as a team dying a lot not being rambo having ptsd carry on soldier.",2

"great game. as of release it started out slow, but that certainly isnt new with the arma franchise. arma 2 started out the same way. fact is this game is big- its going to be played for years to come and well into the future. it has both a passionate community as well as development team. to use them as an analogy, arma is like a fresh baked batch of your grandmothers signature chocolate chip cookies as compared to the traditional store-bought chips-ahoy of contemporary bf/cod titles. granted, one is a tactical shooter and the others are less realistic arcade shooters, but im sure you know what i mean. this game is definately worth buying! keep it up bohemia.",2
"the game is fun if you know what you are doing, if you know how to press 5 keys in about 1 seconds time then you will have no problem with the controls. there is a large learning curve when it comes to people coming from games like tf2 or counter-strike. you have to be tactical, and that is what defines the series as a whole. but for $60 i would recomend waiting for a sail even though there is plenty of content to have grounds for a purchase.",1
"the greatest game i have ever played, if you are looking to go in the military or currently in the military this simulator is for you. even if you are not in the military but love the armed forces this game teaches alot reading maps, combat skills, etc.... this game was made by the best for the best.",1

"i paid 30 pounds for a game that crashes every 5 minutes. i have checked forums and i have tried to fix this problem for the last month. i dont think the issue is with my computer. i dont mind any of the other countless bugs in this game but i draw the line when it crashes constantly. how am i supposed to imerse myself when this is constantly happening. i am gonna just stick with arma 2 which is a fantastic game and has already got a better community.this game is more then just a dissapointment, its unplayable.",1
"the game itself is good, the multiplayer is difficult to get used to but it is insane. the only real problem with it is that the people who run the servers are all 13 year olds who have these little things called server rules which usually pertain to if you run someone over, server ban. if you kill someone outside a red circle, server ban. if you do anything fun that can make another person mad, server ban. in other words, this is not dayz where you could torture people. however- highly enjoyable game.",2

"this is simply the closest you will ever come to actually going into combat, love it!",1
"i pre-purchased this game before it even came out and here i am nearly two years later and this game is just terrible... arma 2: oa is much better. arma 3 is not terrible neccesarily becuase of the gameplay, i want to add its terrible becuase it just runs absolutly horrible on my computer for some reason i have no idea why... i can never get above 25 fps.... i have an amd fx cpu (8 cores @ 4.0 ghz) and an nvidia gtx 770 gpu... why does this game run so horribly bad?? dont tell me its cause i have an amd processor because that is not a valid excuse. even 2 years later this game is $60 and another $16 if you want two extra helicopters? its ridiculous! this game had potential to be a great successor to arma 2 but it just falls so short it isnt as fun, its runs terribly so i just cannot recomment it to anyone. another side note, i dont know if this is because of the low quality settings i have to use...but, the sky always seems like it is soo bright and washes out detials so bad arma 3 just look terrible. im so very disapointed in this game.",1
"just buy arma 2, its performs better and doesnt have the bulk of its content locked behind dlc. also it doesnt crash nearly as much.",1
"arma extremely fun, has a lot of mod-ability, and good fun with friends with a lot of coop action. im glad i bought it as early as alpha, and has offered hours of fun. however, this game is clunky. almost furiously clunky. they take all this time to design a great concept for a game, create all the content of arma 3 and develop this game. the only problem is, they built it on an out dated and really bad engine. at times, i cannot help but ask myself why. like why cant i move while switching weapons. or why everytime i move its just delayed. even my relatively powerful computer can barely run this game with 30 frames when theres some action. dont get me wrong, its still a fun game. i really enjoy it, but its like arma 2s engine with a lot more content that it can barely handle, and its pretty easy to tell.",1
"greatest battlefield simulator for pc of all time!!!",2

"best game ever you can play as a rabbit. 100/10 masterpice!",1
"arma 3 is a eagerly welcomed upgrade from arma 2. the new stance system, upgraded engine, and water gameplay truly helps you experience the life of a military operator. the best part is that the modding community is stronger than it was for arma 2, with mods ranging to advanced ai to weapon resting, and custom gear to real world weapons, this game does everything better. arma is the only game youre going to find where its a good idea to find youre grandpas old army handbooks.",1
"one of the best game ive played in the past couple of months",1
"an absolute beast of a game. among campaign which ive never touched there is wasteland, altis life, battle royal/hunger games mod, and last but not least the infamous breaking point. i fell in love in wasteland, and loved this game even more in altis life, and then i played br and bp, and this game is absolutley one of my favorites of all time. especially among shooter games. it may be laggy at times, and even unbearable, and downright prude, but with friends you can have nothing but a good time. invest time into downloading teamspeak and unite with me and we will downright reek havok and tomfooleries among this whole game. i give this game a 9/10, only due to laggy and buggy servers at times, but besides all else this game can do nothing else but give you a good time.",2
"when i played this for the weekend it was free, i automatically wanted this game. it has great graphics (so long as you can handle them) and there are many different things to play to arma 3. much like arma 2, there is wasteland (basically a sandbox part where you can go on 3 different teams blufor, opfor, or independent. and you can collect weapon crates, get vehicles, and do missions). there is a mission called altis life (if you dont know what it is, then you must look it up on youtube). there is also another mission, this one im not sure if it was on arma 2, but it doesnt seem like it. this one is called king of the hill. this game mode and 3 different teams fighting for one objective as the biggest firefight you will ever have. ive never played it myself but my friends who own this game tell me its a very fun, and addicting game mode. so i recommend this game to anyone who likes games like arma 3.",1

"bohemia interactive never stop surprising me. when you think they reached the best anyone can do, you notice the beta or alpha in the name, that tells you that isnt even the best they can do. from arma ii and pretty much all the expansion packs, to arma iii. if you enjoy a realistic war simulator, or wasting times in the huge amount of mods you can find for the game (looks like skyrim), this is your game!",1
"the game is so realistic that i have contracted ptsd.",1
"this game is not just a stimulator !! its a great stimulator!! also, those drones in the game are excellent!!!",2
"i expected this to be more fluid and playable than arma ii and it wasnt at all. regardless of what multiplayer mode you play, 90% of the game is running from point a to point b, and the other 10% is getting spawnkilled.",1
"a great open world survival, the mods make this game anything! from multiplayer to a dayz mod! fun and enjoyable with all your friends...",1
"if you have the computer to run it prepare to have the best time of your life. i have played arma 2 since 1 year ago, dayz mod, and other server just make me smile. memories of executing russians with norwegian guys. running over people with cars and dying from hilarious bugs. arma 2 was amazing. later on i got arma 3, every penny of the 60 bucks it cost this game was worth it. it is so far my favorite game and when you play with others you will create memories that you will never forget. lets just say arma 3 is the best game i have ever played, and ive played a lot of games.",1
"at first it was not like any war game. it was one of the worst. then i played it a bit more. i do not believe love on first sight, so i built it up. now i love this game more than any other game! you just need to find your favourite game modes (that players have scripted) like king of the hill or altis life. everyone can find their own! just make sure you do not play alone. fighting alone in war is not fun! also, i strongly recommend using your brain to come out from difficult situations. 360 noscope will not help you in arma.",4
"love the game, but including the multiplayer and themods. this game is god like",1
"awesome,simply the ultimate military simulation. fantastic graphics and visual and pure realism. incredible weapons feedback and perfect accuracy of balistic and physical. many awesome user missions such as: altis life rpg, wasteland and many more .",1
"best game ever, great combat system, great weapon system, amazing players, large amount of server",1
"i love this game.i took me a week to get use to it but is a good game check it out",1
"-i asked my friend how low can you go? -he accepted the challenge -flew close to water in a chopper -touches water with the smallest part of the chopper for less than 1 second -we crash and die -laughed our asses off 12/10 would crash again",1
"i didnt even own the game for 30 mins, didnt even get to play except when they were offering to play it for free! and i was global banned. wtf. that isnt right, thats called fraud.",1
"this game is sooo cool play these gamemodes: king of the hill, altis life",1
"pretty fun i run around for 17 hours, and then i found someone and they were elite solider irl and pwned me. good game.",1
"this game is enjoyable if you like realistic shooters. probably my favorite game on pc excluding league. arma has the advantage of mods over all other shooters. i highly recommend picking up the battle royale mod which turns the game into a dayz like free for all which is highly enjoyable when working together with friends. well worth 60 bucks although if you missed the sale and youre a friend of mine that i clearly told get arma 3 then you could have gotten more bang for the buck",1
"awesome game! no run and gun here. only strategic teamwork.",2
"best arma game yet. the breaking point mod is fantastic. a lot better than dayz",1
"awesome game, major improvements, especially the voice acting because in arma 2, it was horrible to listen to. although there is plenty of random crashes, this is afterall alpha so it has time to be improved, but just from the alpha ive had a great time.",3
"high quality vegetation simulator with plenty of things to do",2
"its not a good game for newbies. no, its not... i use to sit at a place and watch the sunset. i have no idea how to actually shoot, drive and complete missions. its like my personal sunset simulator. and its damn beautiful. 10/10",5
"this game is really a great combat simulator, its one of my all time favorites, and i do highly recommend this game to anyone that likes combat or army games......",1
"a beautifully done, full-on military simulation that keeps you entertained for hours on end. it takes a bit to get used to, but after that, its amazing.",1
"awsome game best fps out there, it really is. prepare to get randomly globbal banned and ruin all your online gameplay, including dayz sa as well... so you didnt try to hack? ahaha we dont care we have your money.",2
"i bought this game for $60 and the next day there was a 50% off sale. not even mad about it. 11/10",2
"great game. desync kinda kills it, but all the fun you can have in altis life/wasteland pretty much makes up for it. the voice acting is pretty bad, but i dont really play the game for the campaign anyways :p 8/10",1
"trekking+bug+desync+low fps+a few weapons simulator",1
"could definitly use some work about some details, but i think its worth buying if you know how to use your brain during combat situations. but is not as immersive as the previous arma games in my opinion.",1
"needs some transport planes but other than that its good",1
"this is a great game and i wuld recomend this to anybody that likes a little more technical gameplay and not call of duty  mode. does not run like a charm but it runs ok with max settings (4670k 4.3ghz and msi 780 at 1180 mhz)",4
"i was supposed to take out a squad, then radio the defected officer to call in a helicopter for me to blow up. as the helicopter got close, i popped a smoke in the middle of a field to signal the helicopter to land there. the pilot decided to crash into a wind turbine. 10/10",1
"i love this game only bad thing is that its so addictive xd this game is so much fun to play with friends. none of my friends wanted to buy it at first once they saw a few videos they fell in love now they play even more than me xd",3
"my favourite game, the arma series is great. there is so much to do now that the campain is complete, zeus has been released, there is the editor and workshop to create your own content or play other poeples. hopefully there is more to come",3
"great game, truely is. just if your expecting instant fun, like like you see on yt, just watch the videos, its more fun xd",1
"absolutely the best arma by far i just cant seem to stop playing it.",2
"this game is a great addition to the arma series. it fits the style of many gamers and has a very memorable feel to the gameplay. also, the workshop addons are a very great plus. you should pick it up now if you havent already, its worth it!",1
"far more polished than arma 2, this brings the series into a more modern timeline. has a slightly more tech feel to it, graphics and engine are cranked up a notch and feels a lot more fluid, but this is still arma, and it wont suit the casual gamer looking for a call of duty experience. this is still a simulator shooter at the core. despite optimisiations and a vast improvement over arma 2, you will still want (and need) a beast pc to do this game any kind of justice.",1
"emense with so many possibilities with mods. a great game any way you want it.... yehaa come on in..",2
"i do recommend this game from all the gameplay ive seen (i dont currently own the game) however, it is the only game i know that strategically promotes military warfare very very accuraretly. i love the stimulation of the game and i love every single thing about it even the bugs. if i had the opportunity to play it i would 100% give my full review about the game and my experiences. i can not afford it at the time however, even after i would fully support the game.",1
"if you like a single-player story-driven game where you are lead by commanders who are insane beyond belief, then this is the game for you. missions normally play like this... commander: kerry, we need you to take over location x. heres an rpg, 2 rockets, a rifle, 6 magazines, 2 grenades, some 40mm rounds, and 5 first aid kits. here is a squad of 5 people. five minutes into the mission, i am wounded and my entire squad is dead leaving me to face against 30 people alone and 1-2 armored vehicles. after about an hour of dying, i will have completed the mission. i feel like almost a god... 5/5 would recommend to military lovers and/or people who love to die.",1
"massive military sandbox with several weapons and vehicles as well as room for its large modding community arma 3 is a masterpiece of a game.",3
"amazing depth and attention to detail. highly recommend trying (but really giving it a chance) altis life... really submersive gameplay with almost a realitime interactive storyline to it.. train to become a police officer or a medic, or become a rebel and perform raids and attacks on towns. only issue i have with arma 3 is when i alt+tab and then go back into to the game my player loses the ability to jog, only walking or sprinting...",3
"well where can i start? i would reccomend this game because its one of the best millitary simulators i have ever played with a variety of different maps, guns and everthing you could possibly want. definately reccomend this to anyone who is intrested! -fbgaming",3
"10.0 pros: -an insane amount of high quality, super fun, multiplayer mods -simulation style in all aspects -pretty graphics -super customizable from head to toe -once you grasp it, its ing awesome -breaking point (mod) -altis life rpg (mod) cons: -lots of controls to work with -not your average shooter; steep learning curve",1
"some call it the best war simulator out there ,others call it balanced and smooth game...i will call it  that uses every key on your keyboard simulator oh and the weapons sound like potatos :3",1
"war changes people.. >taking a stroll through the woods in single player campaign. >hear a loud explosion. look over and my sergeant is dead. >killed by landmine >kneel over his body crying >sergeant adams no! >im lost without him. >i know what i must do. >i must become sergeant adams. >i remove all of my cloths while i stare over his lifeless body >emerge from the woods 20 mins later wearing bloody cloths and a helmet >return to camp >sergeant adams reporting for duty! >no one asks why im wearing his cloths >i continue to wear the helmet throughout the campaign >adams is love, adams is life. 10/10 would ptsd again",1
"ive been in the army since 2002, and ive never experienced anything as realistic as arma 3. it gives you the chance to use tactics almost like real life. if youre into military games, and realism - then you must buy arma 3. youre missing out on something great if you dont!!!",2
"game isnt realistic tbqh if i was really a solider i wouldbe owning n000bs and  womyn like are they mad?",1
"arma 3 feels like a step down compared to arma 2 with its smaller samey feeling arsenal (that doesnt even include some short of shotgun.you heard me no shotguns.) and rather boring missions. its poorly optimized and needs a lot of work to become a proper successor to its more entertaining and vastly superior predecessor. recommended for arma fans that are far more hardcore than me who have probably already bought it. for a finished game it sure is buggy :/. do you have a beefy pc but are still unable to run arma 3 with a consistent fps higher than 30? left click on arma 3 press properties click launch options and insert the following: -nosplash -cpucount=8 ultra if your cpu count is lower change it to 4. if you are still getting bad fps change ultra to high or very high. running arma 3 on higher usually makes it run better then when its lower. logic, right? i get 50/70 frames. very random.",1
"this game is amazing, but its still a unfinished product so just be aware.",5
"the story is great, the gun is awsome ,but some of the storytime is too hard",1
"personaly i envy this freaking game. i love it! the great graphics, combat, and i love how immersive the game is. its easily one of my favorites on steam i played for a bout a week and never wanted to stop. if only i didnt get so many lag spikes and if my pc were better. but regardless of the problems my pc has i would play every day if i could. i highly recommend this game to any experienced pc gamer.",1
"altis life trolling, and even becoming a millionaire, is so ing hilarious. the wasteland is also very fun, with a stealthy approach to everything. 11/10 if you have a good pc, get this game.",2
"this game is armazing! while its prety hungry i can roll it on lowest settings and it still looks alive and wonderful. machanics work great. altis life is really fun. it is obvious that theyve leveled up from amra ii. ii was sort of phasy, while arma iii still have that problem it isnt an issue anymore. the fun part of amra has always been the fact that you must be tactical! treating a delicate game like arma like cod will result in failure, frustration, getting trolled by ten year olds and all in all your little brother will film you freaking out over it and put it on youtube. amazing game. so worth the money. buy it.",1
"got this game yesterday and im loving it! theres a variety of things you can do such as campaign, editor, multiplayer and lots of user made missions you can download to play!",4
"dont read this. you will be kissed on the nearest possible friday by the love of your life.tomorrow will be the best day of your life. now youve started reading this. dont stop. this is so freaky.1. say your name ten times.2. say your moms name five times.3. say your crushes three times.4. paste this to four other games.if you do this, your crush will kiss you on the nearest friday.but if you read this and do not paste this, then you will have very bad luck.send this to 4 games in 143 minutes. when youre done press f6 and your crushs name will appear in big letters on the screen. this is so freaky because it actually works",4
"runs like , i have amd 7950 and the game wont go above 30 fps no matter what i do",1
"this game crashes more than it did in alpha, i have never played a game where me and the people i play with have to constantly repair files because this game is still in such a broken state. you would think with the price tag that comes along with the game that it would crash way less, have less fps issues, and have very to little glitches, but what we have is a overpriced unpolished p.o.s.",1
"the story for arma 3 is great the voice acting is a mediocore but entertaing. the multi -player side is fun as well battle royale is great way to burn some time for sure. the domi and patrol ops servers are entertaing as well if you can find a group of folks that using comms and teamwork.",1
"so there i was.... in the middle of a tdm server... i loaded up with my favorite sniper rifle and ghille suit which was not useful in any way, and spawned in the middle of the firefight. and then what happened? 360 no scope like a baws cod style!........ just kidding, i died instantly. if you want a first-person/3rd-person shooter game that isnt ridiculously  and made like a michael bay movie, then arma 3 is the game for you. im telling you, this game is one of the most realistic (if not the most) war games you will ever find out there. battle on atlis(arma 3 world) takes everything into account - how much gear youre carrying and how heavy it is (because with the new fatigue system, well trained soldiers have been transformed into chain-smokers), with sniping you have to take into account the wind speed, distance, and elevation; stealth tactics and just basic common sense. if youre the one who likes going in guns blazing with explosions everywhere expecting to get a triple kill, then youre in for a rude awakening when you try this game.",1
"good game because it has such a big modding community that its like buying few games in price of one :d arma 3 is best army simulation there is ( even real army use it for training ) this is not your bf cod cs typical shootout.... most popular mods/missions: altis life - mission ( role playing game as civ, police or terroists ) breaking point - mod ( similar to dayz mod ) wastelands - mission ( similar to dayz mod but more focused to team warfare or lone wolf ) battle royale - mod ( aka hunger games, high paced action with tons of adrenaline :d ) hint: for mods you need to download them externly (there is tons of launchers that do all the downloading/installing work for you.) for missions all you have to do is find the server and connect, it will auto download small stuff... (type altis in server filter to find altis servers or wasteland etc) etc this is just example :d",2
"good game, very differnt from arma 2 i do recommend playing with the settings for a good 15 minutes and you can get the game looking very sharp and not bloomy, highly recommend this game there is a gamemode for everyone online",5
"i have to admit i was hating this game in the beginning. i couldnt understand why i kept dying. i couldnt get the controls down and everything felt way to complicated. then a few weeks ago i decided to sit down and learn the game. as other reviewers stated this game is not call of duty or battlefield. you have to be patient. you have to learn the weapons and vehicles. this game is worth every penny as long as you invest a few days to learn the controls. add in steam workshop and other mods (breaking point is my favorite) and you have a fantastic war simulator.",1
"this game is very fun and continues to supprise me every second. i highly recomend it to even to short minded people",1
"the worst game in the series. 1 run - 1 screenfreeze. the issue has been reported to bis many times but they do nothing. waste no money! dont buy the game!",1
"this game, with its amazing modding community working hand in hand with the amazing and easy to use steam workshop, is fast approaching arma 2 in glory.",2
"-i killed some ing civillians -i get out of my own tank to see those glorious dead bodies -my own tank shot me from back friendly fire not tolerated",1
"if you dont get it now, youll be buying for $99 when its out.. 32$ for alpha/beta/full key atm, with the alpha being the current phase.. when you buy the alpha, youre in for life ..",5
"i really dont like this game because there is not enough content. the content they have is not very good, and it seems like they are turning this game in to a dlc whoring game witch really sucks.",3
"the stories you walk away with after a session with a bunch of good friends are nothing any other game can achieve.",1
"this joint off the chain. it looks sexy and i find it satisfying to play. if you liked arma 2, this is much more fluid and streamlined. it takes time to figure out all the keys cus theres so many, but its because of that which gives this game a unique experience of control and realism. now that i think about it moving your head independant of your gun doesnt really do much but it feels baller. on top of all that theres a never ending stream of content on the workshop. theres even a metal gear solid remake.",1
"one of the most realistic games and best game ive played",1
"i have an i7-5820k, 16gb ddr4, ssd and a gtx 980. i can run almost every game maxed out, but only get 35 to 40fps on this game. thats when maxed out, but i still get 35-40 no matter how low or high i set the graphics. and thats after doing all of the cfg changes and launch options! and its barely going above 30% usage for cpu and gpu.",1
"this game feels like it deserves its own catagory. like a sub-genre of sandbox (or open world) but it still has everything like old school fpses. before the whole new arcade style like cod, moh, and bf series. everyone wished these games were more realistic. not only is this the end result of a pc only video game. it is the near end result of a realistic fps military simulation. ontop of that a open world concept where anyone can make anything happen in a multiplayer game and have other people experience what youve made on the editor that is provided in the game.",3
"amazing game, a real step up from arma 2, if you are into fun games, get this one.",2
"not that great of an experience for me, lots of people like it but this is just an opinion. :) (wasted 70$) i never play this game. :(",1
"its cool. you should buy it. now, or later, but now is better",2
"extremely fun and has a diverse amount of different game modes",2
"sick of the same old pvp griefing in other first person shooters? then get yourself and a few friends together and play cooperatively. working together with your mates to complete missions is fun, rewarding and encourages true teamwork. there are literally thousands of missions available in the steam workshop with dozens of new ones each week, giving endless replayability. it is also pretty easy to make your own using the in-built editor. the ai in this game are smart, realistic and unpredictable but also highly configurable to make missions easier or harder to suit your skills. bohemia interactive also have a superb track record of supporting and encouraging community content so there are loads of mods to modify the game setting from subtle to total conversion. it is more complex and sophisticated than other shooters but so much more rewarding. get into it.",4
"not the best shooter but if you like being picked of by snipers this is for you",1
"a realistic army sim, not for the kids that enjoy call of duty. bloody amazing though.",1
"totally worth buy if youre into strategic and intense fps gaming. take good ol delta force 2 and rainbow six, let them have fun in the closet until they appear back in modern days, and you got arma3. it wont give you any mercy, you die a lot, but im 100% sure this game will teach you how to be better soldier also in real life. never gonna miss those headshots again. over and out.",1
"a really interesting sandbox. basically build a story on your own, or play other player-made maps... includes normal deathmatch, coop story games and anything that can be made with your imaginations(requires some level of programming though) only for those who are willing to learn how to play and not just point and kill, like counter-strike. recommend to play as a group.",1
"one of the best games on steam. be sure to check out the mods aswell. (wasteland, battle royale etc)",1
"played the first two missions; super real and crazy fun, it definitely caught me off guard. gameplay time: 2 hrs. played altis life online; got hacked and nuked, wonder if i still have the 24m he gave me. gameplay time: 42 mins.",1
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played so far, even if it says its a simulator, it is still a game. i have played this before, and my computer cant run it very well, but decent. i recommend you get something higher than a gtx 560,(ti) something like a gtx 670 or r9 280x. also, yes, i dont have the game, but i have played it before, and i recommend this game rating:11/10",1
"absolutly love it great gameplay great campaign great multiplayer not much else i can say",1
"great game to start with it has a pretty good community which i value deerly. the game is pretty realistic, this can be a pain if you get shot and you dont even have a clue were it came from. although its a very good games its a bit of a bummer that the campaign is released in parts, but atleast the developers care enought to not rush the release, this would be worse. overall a good game although its pretty heavy for most systems.",2
"doesnt get more realistic for a military sim than this!",1
"i like this game for its realism and amazing at a militery simulator. the only bad thing about it is the physics........",1
"the graphics are good but thats all thats good. full of glitches, bizzare controls, terrible gameplay. worst game ive ever played.",1
"great fun but a bit clunky at times, mods for this game make it much better :d",3
"fantastic! for someone who loves massive maps and blowing  up, this game is #1. the maps are detailed to perfection. the modding is easy as sneezing, with a mod website with new stuff every day. the actual depth of detail in things like damage to specific parts of your helicoptor or different attachments with speed slowing with more weight. there are of course a couple cons. first off: no melee which i can live with but is kind of annoying. second off: if you have a lot of mods installed then its almost impossible to join an online game ( which can be solved my moving mods into a seperate folder but takes forever). even with those cons this is still one of my favorite games to play and would highly recomend it.",1
"the* best military simulator on the market. its the only game where one or two bad guys at the right time, and in the right situation, will get your heart pumping. my go-to game. highly recomended to anybody who has played a military shooter and thought, i wish i could do x, and y. doesnt matter what x and y are, the majority of the time, you can do it in arma.",2
"best game ever the occasional glitch but hell yeah. buy it bro.",1
"if you enjoyed arma 2 you will definitly like this one aswell. the graphics are really nice and the missions are awesome too. there are some nice mods aswell that will keep you play this game after you are done with singleplayer",1
"i love this game!is very real and the graphics are beautiful. the game is very good optimized because my video card has 64 mb and i don`t have lag or problems.thank you for this amazing game!i will play it unlimited!",1
"this game is so mutch fun. even with out the mods that most people play.",1
"definitely a great game, extremely solid multiplayer and will improve as it moves into the final release",1
"not much to it so far as a stock game, but lots of fun regardless and worthy of being in the arma series.",1
"10/10! absolutely love this game. almost so much, im eventually going to upgrade my computer, that means paying about 1,000 euros or more just so i can get this game on highest specs looking amazing! if youre an arma fan than youre going to love this.",4
"buy it! i tested it and its the best and most realistic fps military shooting game ive ever played!",1
"miss the feel the of being a boot on the ground. this gives it back in a way, love the game so far. first time player of the game. would recommend it to anyone who was in the military, especially grunts.",1
"its not a good game for newbies. no, its not... i use to sit at a place and watch the sunset. i have no idea how to actually shoot, drive and complete missions. its like my personal sunset simulator. and its damn beautiful. 10/10",5
"dont even own this game. 10/10 would review nothing again.",1
"ganna be bruthally honest also sorta spolier for you peaple who ever play the single player when you get to atlis its littarly impossible to ever get anywere in the game",1
"an incrediable game that had an unlimited amount of content that keeps you coming back for more. from playing on wasteland to altis life, the amount of fun and enjoyment you can get out of this game is incrediable. esspicially if you play with friends, but he community over all is amazing and your team is likely to support your efforts and welcome you.",1
"too much like arma 2, except arma 2 mods are way better.",1
"the one and only i can be a soldier without training feel the battlefield keep this game alive",1
"very clunky game, not fully optomized yet in my opinion. requires a very high end pc and also requires dlc to play on most servers.",1
"the best authentic military sim available. graphics are amazing, high attention to detail for such a huge open world. this game, like the armas before it is virtually endless with all the user created mods and missions. if you are a military fan, with realism higher than kill count, then this is the game for you. the devs are some of the most involved in the business. there are glitches and bugs, but for the scope of the game, it is understandable, but they never stop fixing and adding to the game. watch a few videos of the gameplay and you get the feel for how intense it can be.",1
"its koolz (did u see what i did there i said cool with a k and z)",1
"arma 3 is hands down the pinnacle of milsim. with real world physics, amazing textures, and a community that just doesnt stop, you will be hard pressed to not enjoy this amazing title. if you have the time and money to invest into this, you will not regret it. dont let the military simulation aspect of this title scare you away! yes, that is the engines intent. however, there is a massive community that plays non-military things in this amazing engine. endless hours of fun await you, friends. i hope to see you on the battlefield. hoo-ah!",3
"definitely a game for big kids, not at all your typical shooter. playing it for the first time wasnt easy by all means, but once you get the hang of it, itll be so much more fun o play than call of duty or battlefield.",1
"one of the best and most realistic modern shooters out there. great online content and community. good campaign. amazing graphics. well worth the money if youre looking for an open world, modern shooter.",1
"do not expect to find a completed military simulator upon downloading the game. do a little research, get the mods from the modding community, and then play. this game will not have many of the most requested features, its always been up to the fans to mod the game to perfection, dont expect that to change here. with the right mods, this game can take hours out of your life. without the mods, this game will fall short of your expectations. do not get this game if you dont like having your game modded. if the mods arent out there yet, give it some time. arma ii fans, welcome to the next installment, its about to get intense.",2
"very fun game once you get used to it. it is not like your usual fps where you can just run around really quick killing everybody. this is why i like this game. the maps are huge, which is a huge plus. no cramped, close quarter battles. and if your team is losing, vehicles! my favorite servers in arma 3 have to be the king of the hill servers. gg!",1
"parachute into a town and start getting screamed at by some scrub to regroup with the squad before i get kicked so i eventually find them and we start taking fire so i run into a building while they just aimlessly stand there and start shooting and then i watched a helicopter crash into them then i get kicked and banned from the sever from scrubbing up the experine for everyone else 11/10 would scrub again",1
"why why why is this game so lagy i get 14 fps and i have a i7 4790k @ 4.7ghz and a msi r9 285 if i put all max i get like 14 to 40 fps on a good sever but wen i put all low i get 14 to 40 fps like wtf why is this game so bad like what do i need my pc cost 1,700$ like really and yall see why ppl go to consols fix this my god you have a very nice game and ppl still play it even if they only get 14 fps with the top of the line hardware this is ridiculous.",2
"best military simulation video games available. totally worth the money and time. chosen as 2013 best simulation game by pc gamer.",4
"this game is just bout the most amazing thing ive ever played, and the zeus dlc adds on tens of thousands of hours of gameplay onto the already huge playability factor... some glitches, lots are pretty funny to witness in a subtle way... and the modding community is crazily active. i would buy this again if i had to, steep price, but it is entirely worth what you pay. this game coming from people who have had contracts with different governments to make accurate virtual battle enviroments for training. ---get it---",4
"arma 3 is a great game but still has quite a few bugs and framerate issues.",1
"sick of the absurdness of the call of duty franchise or the so called realism of the battle franchise? well switch to arma. with stunning graphics and amazing lighting effects. the realism in this game might be too much for some, but thats what the games about, true realism. no idiot sprinting with a sniper rifle or ramming a jet at tanks here. this game is for the mature audience, not prestige 12 year olds.",1
"time has no value when playing this game, hours are mere seconds. its like a crack addiction, you cant get enough and you just dont know when to stop. 10/10",3
"worth every penny, but theres still alot of improvement to be done like fixing the eject from moving vechile and stuff like that there just quite alot of little stupid bugs like that. but would recommend.",1
"great game with great modes, everyone should buy it. huge maps with up to 100+ players online. i recommend geting battle royale mod which is a 1 vs all mode, last one standing wins the game.",3
"amazing game wish i had a better computer to play it on",1
"an excellent follow-up to arma 2. i have over 150 hours to date, and will have more. my major issue with the game is the bugs that have been present in the main game engine since launch, mostly studdering movement, walking through walls, stepping through rocks, subsequently getting stuck in said rock. weird stuff happens in arma. once you figure out the controlls, and work around the frequent and weird bugs, it is a great game.",1
"this game, i love it! a few friends of mine and i have been playing this more recently and it the most fun i have had in a long time compared to other games. should you get this? hell yes!",1
"this game is very fun, but battle eye is a pain. they globally banned me for my cd key being stolen and my account was used for hacking. they told me it was my own fault for get my account hacked and my cd stolen. battle eye is a horrible company and i have no idea why any one uses their serves. if i was you i wouldnt get the game because you will probably get banned in the next week and waste $60. this game is not worth your time or your money.",1
"a (mostly) ground combat platform, widely open to modding fully customizable, not working in 3d vision, track ir greatly raises the experience",2
"if you like realistic warfare games than youll love this!",1
"arma iii is a great versitile game that will provide you with hours of fun provided you find the right server. be warned however that it is taxing on even the best of rigs at high settings.",1
"this is a great military simulator with a great campagin that is actually a good campagin and i highly reccomend this game for the 60.00 usd it is, also has very many good gamemodes and servers, also has a great community and is nothing like arma 2",1
"other than the fact that bohemia has to yet add bipods and ieds, which i find quite lame and  because they are basic concepts to a sim shooter(i shouldnt have to put a trigger down for a proximity ied, should work just like a mine). luckly their are mods and the game is very fun once you get used to using mods. playing this game with a group is a must as the ai are not the greatest on pathfinding, but are fully capable of sniping you across the map. arma has a great modding community and tries to cover for bohemias shortfalls and does a great job. in game mission editor is very similar to the arma ii mission editor, but the modules system helps it stand out. it gives you hints on how to use the modules and doesnt rely on you having to put in a bunch of scripts. however you still can use scripts for greater flexablity. i will personally be wasting more hours on this game.",2
"an amazing game, i recommend to only players who have patience and are skilled. this is not an easy game to play.",2
"i loved flashpoint dragon rising and red river and i love this too. xd",2
"love this game! i like it because it is tactical and not cod. the ways you can tackle a mission is amazing!",5
"this is the best sandbox shooter i played in my life you definitely have to try this one with a mod like wasteland",3
"this game is the most realistic war simulator there is. it takes a bit of time to get used to it but then after a while the game gets a bit easier. it is a hard game but thats what makes it realistic.",2
"the reqirments are way too high and too good for my pc to handle",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. the realism is outstanding.",1
"went into a multiplayer server, started a smoke grenade rave at the ao. got teamkilled shortly after. 11/10",5
"good multiplayer and interesting campaign good fun alround",1
"lots of amazing mods for this game. for the hardcore military buffs, this offers a great simulation of multiple military situations. from scuba infiltration to defending a convoy via helicopter.",1
"its super fun to play with friends and is very interesting.",1
"one of my top games for the past two years! a must especially with all the mods (life, tacbf, epoch, etc.)!",2
"great shooter. i have to say its definitely not one of your generic fps games (a.k.a. battlefield, cod, etc.) and it takes realism to a whole new level. id say it gets about a 9.5/10.",1
"arma 3 is a great game all by iteslf but add in mods such as the day z and altis life and this game is serious bang for your buck.",1
"its nice game and i love it so much gamemodes and servers",1
"outstanding tactical game if you want realism, multiple play styles and endless customisation!!!! a must have to learn to play!",4
"most def one of the best shooters i have ever played",1
"this game is a ripoff of call of duty. dont buy it. 90/100",1
"ok first things first. this game has endless possibilities, great campain, pvp modes king of the hill or wasteland, even better pvp in battleroyale, role playing games like altis life and arma 3 life, zombie(dayz) mods like breaking point. in fact when you get arma its like you got 10 different games, which is awesome! my first day in altil life looked like this: i go get my licence, buy a car, get a delivery mission. i got one farest, like 26 kilometers acros altis. got on a highway, after couple of miles, i crash into abandoned vehicle on the middle of the road without toolkit. some guys found me on the road and gave me their truck so i could continue(awesome guys). couple of miles ahead guy jumps in front of my truck trying to rob me, and he did robbed me. he walked back into his chopper and somehow insta chrashed(talk about insta karma?). i picked up his money and procced, only to be pulled over by a cop for speeding, he wrote me a ticket. finally after 2 hours a got to my destination and delivered a package, i was so happy. 10/10 would recommend to anyone!",1
"if you want a good feeling tactical shooter, this game is for you. i love this and have put in countless hours. a mod friendly game and a large community make this a double wammy beauty. 5/5",5
"really awesome game, i give it a 10/10 for gameplay. there are still many issues with this game though. you constantly fall through stairs and break your legs randomly. you just have to be really careful with stairs.",1
"this game and is daily updates -_- but its a good game lol.",1
"fun game, dont get me wrong. im recommending it if youre into realistic shooters. youre going to need a beefy processor. this game is not optimized for gpu rendering. it is meant for cpus.",1
"deffinetely the best game ive ever played. great to play with friends on wasteland mode. so much you can do",1
"the best arma yet! the new game engine really brings this franchise to life. fantastic visuals, remastered sound and very effective physics all make this version worth upgrading to. theres even underwater capabilities now... the downside: somewhat unoptimized graphics (although im sure theyll fix it) and bohemias usual dumb ai and abysmal pathfinding. all in all though, a really good simulation that begs to be played cooperatively. recommended :)",1
"not bad...could be better if i could find the secret m3lons in it...i was promised m3lons",2
"got killed through a wall of smoke from 700m away by a 9mm. 11/10 would get rekt again",4
"this game is brilliant! whilst it does have a massively steep learning curve, when you do start getting it right you feel like an absolute boss! the multiplayer is great but takes a lot of practice. buy this game, its awesome!",1
"not worth the price. arma 3 is a quite enjoyable game but far from worth 40 bucks. why? 1. singleplayer campaign is lame and unexplained. though i have to give the community a thumbs up for making some great scenario missions (custom missions). 2.the game is poorly optimized. when driving, flying or anything where your character moves fast, framerate drops to extremely low. i mean like from 90-100 fps to 20-30 fps. thats bad. 3. the graphics on terrain, vehicles and houses are just beautiful. though the playermodels look like theyre from a ps2 game.",1
"battle royalle is awesome, the game is very cpu dependent but never drops more than 30 fps if you reduce visibility to 1000 or lower. you will not disappoint.",1
"its a game you would most probally hate initally but if you put your time into exploring things such as the editor or try out some of the amazing mods you will grow to love this series.",3
"deffinatly recomend this game, ive spent over 800hrs on this and have loved every bit of it!!!!!!!!!!",5
"what can i say its a great game. the communitys good, lots of fun, massive levels, real shooting simulater :) i recommened medium settings even to people with top spec pcs. my only down side to this game is optimisation. apart from that you get hundreds of hours out of this game lots of content and it deffenatly takes the cake for me over cod and battlefield. 9/10",1
"slowly slowly getting in this game. its got a little steeper learning curve to it if you played any arma 2 games. i heard today that a arma 3 epoch server is coming up soon. really looking forward to. espically to play a new map altis which looks really rich and eventful. i would look at picking this up in the steam sale if you liked arma 2 or dayz mods.",1
"very well made, robust and fun game. the graphics are great and the game runs smoothly. the one thing that annoys me are the controls that can be some what overwhelming and clumsy, but they have made them to be as realistic as possible. they variety and freedom of this game is huge and gives a lot of room for modders to create great content. remember that arma is not a simulator, rather a set of tools that aim to be realistic and give a lot of freedom to the users and modders to do what they want with the game.",1
"when you play this game, you will become karma charger",1
"still some of the most bug infested games ive seen. texture and ground control is a joke, turn around to fast in a building and you might get killed. hide behind a rock? bad idea, as rocks have a tendancy to swollow you whole and spit you out somewere else to fall to your death. its a little strange really, seing that these things worked stably in games developed over two decades ago, like doom and wolfenstein 3d. is arma 3 still in early alpha?",3
"this game is awesome i love it its so realistic and everything so i will continue playing this game cause it is to awesome alright :)",1
"it was a great game to play even with friends because there are somethings that you can mess around with in the game.",1
"arma 3 is a awesome very worth the price game it includes great graphics and fps it supplys realistic good gameplay that will make someone go to the edge of their chair constantly updated 10/10",4
"i really need help here! when i startup the game it freezes when i load the bohemia interactive logo and i tried all the standard methods of fixing the issue yet nothing worked. does anyone else have the same issue and/or know how to fix the issue?",1
"got sniped and tea bagged 15/10 would bang over a dirty table.",1
"i cant believe this ran on my inagraded graphics pc",1
"this game is awesome, play altis life only!!! gun game to thats pretty good, altis life you can be a great and succesfull police officer to a stinken rich drug cartel!!",1
"this is the most solid simulator out there. the game is improved in countless ways since the previous title in the series. name a game that can beat arma in strategic military large-scale team play. none? i didnt think so.",4
"tbh this game is 2 good 4 me i have to take time to remind myself that this game is a game and not irl",2
"arma 3 continues on the merits of the original operation flashpoint and while many additions imply much welcomed improvements throughout, the core of the issues remain unresolved, leaving complexity rather than depth. it is the best version of the sandbox/editor/experiment, but as a game, it is still the flawed mess that the original flashpoint introduced back in the days. atleast flashpoint had the excuse of originality being it was the first of its kind when released, which leaves arma 3 to nothing more than minor improvements in an environment that requires massive enhancements. buy if the previous titles meant something to you to the extent of wanting to experience them in a slightly newer engine. avoid if you expected them to actually make a game of quality.",1
"this game is probably the best thing i have experienced on the pc..",3
"globally banned for no reason within first hour after purchase.",1
"this uniqe game offers a much much more realistic combat experince then any other shooter. call of duty and battlefeild have been left in the dust years ago.",1
"this game is not realistic at all really. recoil is garbage, the weapon sway is way to much, the damage you do to enemies is way to low, it shouldnt take more than 1 shot to the head to kill someone but in this game it does at times, when you fire a weapon fire doesnt come out of the barrel like how it does in this game, also 90 percent of everything in this game is fake and the rest are prototypes/in use. the only things that i can think of in this game that are real are the 556 weapons which do barley any damage so you dont every use them anyways... this game would be better if it wasnt called arma 3, because it ruined the arma name...",2
"its insanely hard to figure out but i hope that by the time i do itll still still be fun",1
"car physics, fatigue is pretty dumb. good looking , runs",1
"this is a fantastic game with a good realistic gunplay system.",1
"ing spent 120 euros to get 3 coppies... steam gives 40% discount 2 days later..  you!! besides this game ed up.",1
"realism at its finest. doesnt get much more real than this ladies and gents.",3
"this game gets better and better every update. between the countless game modes and the workshop missions you can play this game is countless fun. i would suggest to wait until they do a 50% off weekend to buy it since they do those 50% off sales often. not saying its not worth the 60 bucks to buy it but just to save you some money. 10/10",3
"this is a military sandbox game ive never seen before..with mcc 4 mod i can make my own custom mission easily. but i dont know how to make a character modelling as a new unit. im not a 3dsmax / blender expert so can anyone show me the way to do so..actually now i want the indonesian armed forces pack so bad..",1
"first run and attempt join to any server ... game crash and back to desktop . ok no problem. second run and join to any server works fine. graphic amazing but ... sometimes strange artifacts where you can see object through walls. players in choppers sometimes are sitting in chair etc. on server without 3rd view when you switch view then for 30 seconds you screen is getting from black - maybe it was mod error. playing on servers with 64 can kill your cpu. same boring like arma2. nothing fun for bf players and im happy for free weekend so i will not spend money on this game. if you like spend 40min driving truck to aoi and die in 1sec ... this game is for you.",1
"for some reason playing on a laptop..(a pretty good one) i have no in game menu. meaning if i die i have to close the game down using the taskmaster. are you kidding me. what a great game completely sploilt by the fact that you cant play it.",4
"arma is how my hubby convinced me to join the pc gaming community. couldnt say enough good about it! cant wait to see how it evolves over the next few years. :)",1
"10/10, ive only had this game for a few days now and i have accoplished so much. reason being is because there is so much to do! countless hours of fun.",1
"awesome game,and recommend it but only if you have a beefy computer or a gaming laptop.but other than that its a wonderful game and if u dont have a beefy computer like i have a normal laptop it kind of works but got to find a serer with low ping or with little people.",1
"this game could be the best simulator known to man",1
"one of the most expanded game ever made. every aspect of the physics is independent and gives stunning effects. + feeling of shooting + precisely made weapons + precisly constructed wehicles + movement + stances + challenging + lot of mods + almost every aspect of the game + you can fall in love in it - or you can hate it - some bugs - too hard for some people",1
"it looks like a great game, but the controls are impossible. i went straight for the helicopter training and its just impossible to play on any of the presets. there is no azerty keyboard support what so ever.",1
"this is a good game and had alot of fu with it +100000000000000000 should get it",1
"arma is the most impressive, ambitious, challenging, and rewarding game i have ever played. arma is best enjoyed with friends (and teamspeak). the mod community is outstanding, and our clan has really gotten into map/scenario-making. if you are new to arma, id recommend first hopping in to a king of the hill (hostile takeover is pretty good). you can lonewolf it by casually moving with teammates; you can take the next step and ask if someone has an in-game group going and move with them; you can take the greatest (and most rewarding) step and join a group in teamspeak. feel free to reach out to me, personally, for tips or if youd like to play with our community:",2
"sucks big time!!! i have a i5 @ 3.0ghz, 250gb ssd, r7 260 ati with 2gb, 4gb ram, 600w power, windows 7 home premium 32bit and the damn thing says that my adapter does not support direct x 10... it took me 3 days to download from server. i have 50mbps internet connection and when finaly it was complete, it didnt even start!!! sucks big time!!!",1
"probably one of the best games i own, everything about this game is great! 10/10 if i could i would  this game!",1
"i love this game. its got the realism, heart pounding action, and community that i love. however, it does have its faults. its main one is its multiplayer fps. in single player i get between 80 and 60 fps depending on how heavy the action is, but the moment i join a multiplayer server (even one i host myself on a blank map) it struggles to stay over 20 with the same settings in the same areas. i have a pretty beefy rig as well, so unless you have a true monster, be warned. my specs cpu: intel i7-4770k @ 3.50ghz ram: 32 gb gpu: nvidia titan z os: windows 7 ultimate 64-bit",1
"i loved the new attachment system along with the steam workshop so mission makers could easily upload their awesome or not so awesome missions. what i disliked is the amount of recoil on some weapons and the new weapons themselves they are to futureristic in my opnion. what i did to enjoy the game better as a whole was to install a few mods to help with recoil and then i got a mod called @us_weapons from a mod downloader called playwithsix or pws. at any rate i wish the best of luck to all the gamers of arma 3 currently and in the future.",2
"a more realistic battlefield/cod when you play modes like wasteland or king of the hill; can also be fun if you play the dayz mod for free; battle royal, do i need to say more? get dropped on an island with 30 other people, find a weapon and survival of the fittest!; if youre the roleplaying person, who likes to deal drugs, have s (women, who sell their bodies to greasy guys) or just be a corrupt cop, then altis life is just the right thing for you! so in general, this game offers are great variety of mods, its very own realism and its not full of garbage kiddies, who flame and pretend to have made love with your mother (like the cod-fanboys, lel) 10/10 would buy again",2
"the most realistic military experience short of being dropped into a live warzone just got more intense with the go kart addon.",1
"best game in my library, alot of people wont like this game cause it isnt easy like cod or battlefield, well they need to learn what strategy is and skill and simulation. because this is top of the line!",1
"amazing game runs way better than arma 2 even on bad pcs",1
"well bohemia did it again what can i say its the best war simulation out there get this now !!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"when i first read the title of this game i must have been drunk cause i read it as boner. when i fianally got to play the game i was pleasantly surprised because i did infact have a boner. this game literally has everything, wanna  some  up on go carts? its got it. wanna channel your inner hot  from the hunger games? battle roayale is your . you can even grow weed and 420 blaze it up in this circle jerk of a game. imagine if you injected grand theft auto 5 with testosterone and maybe a hint of estrogen, wanna know what you would get? arma 3 aka a 12.5/13",1

"i have played this game for around 130 hours now and i just extremely enjoy it. here are some pros and cons. + in-depth combat + realistic + infantry, ground, water, and air combat + a  ton of mods + a  ton of custom missions + all the dlc is basically free. (every new feature will be available for everyone. while you cannot drive certain vehicles, you will be able to ride them as passenger. and when there will be new features like the ability to slingload cargo, you can do it as well without paying for the dlc.) - the game doesnt run that well, even on the highest-end machines you most likely wont get more than around 50 fps. - there arent that much servers, gamemodes like altis life seem to have taken over the server list, resulting in a low amount of co-op missions. so expect to bring friends to this if you would like to play missions online. - the games performance is heavily decided by the server. if the server laggs you will not only get lagg, but a low framerate as well. here are some final ratings as well: gameplay / fun = 9/10 replayability = 10/10 performance = 6/10 dlc = 8/10 servers = 5/10",1

"great game, you have complete control on editor and there are many other online game modes to choose from. you can commnicate with other players very well and everyone gets involved. so if you were thinking about getting i i really recommend you do.",2
"best game ever. you can play wasteland or battle royal. if you prefer more relaxing gameplay then try altis life role play.",2
"well... this is the best war game out here i play battlefield cod but this is simply amazing!!! this is a war game where you can do anything!! its like gta and battlefield @ the same time lol love it",1
"i highly recomend this to any person that is smart and patient if ur use to cod and like it dont play this arma is way to realistic compard to any arcade game such as cod/bf3/bf4. one of my favorite games and alwats will be",1
"this game has pretty good looking graphics. the options or configure menu could be hard to understand to some players. the controls are overcomplicated. ragdoll physics is horrible. but the game is trying to be more tactical like,well its not tactical at all most of you enemies run out in the open like hey! look at me! shoot me!. playing alone isnt to great but with friends you capture the whole experience of arma 3. the maps are huge so you have to do lots of exploring,pretty cool if you enjoy exploring. the vehicles have their own controls maybe except the land vehicles and some other type of vehicles. the air vehicles are hard to control unless you played the rest of the armas.(btw still dont know how to use air vehicles). is this a full release or a beta? i do not know it has plenty after plenty of bugs to fix. like when that time i shot some one his body had an oversized neck the body itself had its body armor turned into a size of a pea. this game is 4/10 hard to recommend.",1
"you will have to look far for a bether modern military shooter, if you can get over the bad interaction menu",1
"arguably the most authentic milsim experience you can get without experiencing the real life hazards of warfare.",1
"the game is just great, sadly im waiting for some better hardware to play it xd i bought it when it was 25 on alpha. no regrets at all! love the series. from arma 2 i feel so much improvement in the game its amazing.",1
"this game is amazing. theres just no other way to describe it.",2
"had a great experience in this game,plenty of details in arma3,so impressive!",1
"if you are looking for a fast fps this is not a game for you! arma 3 is a slow fps you can go from 1st person to 3rd person, you can play arma 3 on a 380 pc on low setting! i have tryed it on a low end pc from pc world and a high end prebuilt one! they both run nice but the low end computer has nad fps, crashing alot, but on single player it runs really good! you can oc your still with msi afterburner to get better frames, but other than that arma 3 is a amazing game!",1
"its not optimized... no fun playing at 20fps always while on online servers. i would say, spend your money else where. it could be fun if they ever fix the framerate issues but i doubt they will. i think id have to be honest and say i dont recommend this game because of that.",1
"no more family share so i cant play unless i waste another 60$ :/",1
"love this game could play for the rest of forever just need to make the dlc free and add in new gun skins aswell as new air/land/sea vehicles. other than this its a beautifull game.",5
"not a good game. its unrealistically difficult to aim and move, there is barely any content for players who dont play with others online, and it doesnt look that great. overall, this game is worth ten dollars, but if youre looking to play the modded version of the game it may have some value. i was looking for a military simulator, or a tactical shooter, and this is neither.",1
"really good game its an open world game u can do whatever u want.",2
"extremely fun and has a diverse amount of different game modes",2
"these graphics are better then my eye-sight.. but the game runs like crap",2
"love it. bohemia has really outdone themselves. the campaign grows constantley with each update. multiplayer is fun, with official servers and game modes, or mods to play, or even just some simple scenarios with friends. love the multiplayer, and is super easy to learn through the virtual reality simulator, and the virtual arsenal allows you to see how well you fight with what gun. loved it",1
"singleplayer is an exercise in pain on high difficulty. game overwrites autosaves and limits you to 1 save. prepare your body for an autosave with grenade launcher rounds inbound forcing you to restart. great roguelikelike.",1
"best game ever! needs some minor tweaks and i could recommend a few additional things that would make the game even better but if youre reading this section to find out whether it is worth buying --- i can honestly confirm that if you have a beaty enough pc this game is great!",2
"terrible optimization, controls, plot and animations. most of servers have white list so they will kick out as you join them. when you find a good server all you play is a walking simulator and not a war game. i am not a call of duty or battlefield fan but i think they are good games if you compare them to this. also, people pretend this war game is realistic. no, its not. the only realistic thing is the boredom",1
"great game. some good mulitplayer mods avaible for it too. altis life is well worth a blast",1
"part 3 of this awesome series, simply the best military simulator around.",1
"such a beast game, bohemia really outdid them self!",1
"recommend to anyone who likes any sort of combat game. has great balance of first person combat and vehicle (sea, land and air) combat. the weapons dont customise very much, but that doesnt matter so much as there is a very wide range of weapons and attachments. very well optimised and runs smoothly on all occasions. the only problem is if you are playing online with a computer running at low settings, as you cannot see enemys as clear or as far away as those with higher grade computers can, and sometimes becomes annoying. but the game is worth the purchase just for the campain.",1
"pros: better graphics better controls better sound cons: same laggy multiplayer as arma 2 same terrible interaction system still using outdated arma 2 mod tools (all mods are just ports) most vehicles and weapons are the same between factions, just different textures still uses 2004 netcode its trying to be more casual as of right now, i do not feel as if this game is worth the $60, it still plays like its in alpha. unless they release proper mod tools, i would not buy until it drops atleast 50% in price.",2
"got killed in the bootcamp prolouge. 11/10 game of the year.",1
"goat game, baller, and well mong. get this on sale or whatever, go to agia, wreck shop.",2
"arma 2 was a really good simulation of war. but when i bought arma 3 it changed my mind about everything its more realistic looks and feels good to play. the frame drops in sandbox are ridiculus. thats the only bad thing i have to say about it.",4
"slow-paced and heavily strategic/tactical. its a game that may not be fun, but it can be very immersive and tries to give you a breathtaking experience. if youre one of those guys that likes hardcore realistic simulation, then this game is definitely the best out there. also its more than just a game, its a platform that has plenty of mods to keep you busy when the original theme of the game is not quite what youre looking for.",1
"greedy dlc, the game is still in beta. the funnest thing to do by far is koth online but good luck getting in a server, randomly the server broswer will flip out and report 0 servers. at which time the only solution is to completely restart the game. every time hearing that stupid theme when it starts up, duh duh dunnn duh! server broswer reports 0 servers, restart.... duh duh dunnn duh! 15 bucks for a couple of rifles and diffrent color guillie suits <.<, helicopter pack 15 bucks, still in beta my . money grab, poorly optimized 6/10 duh duh dunnn duh! ....... 5/10",2
"one of the best games out there wheter youre into survival modes, deathmatches or role play. theres a mod for everyones needs. would rate 9/10, the only thing that prevents it from being 10/10 is that you will spend a while downloading mods for certain popular gamemodes.",3
"shaping up to be a very pretty game. i just hope they optimise the engine as its pretty poor at the moment (keeping in mind its still alpha as i write this).",1
"you think this is a tactical 1st person/3rd person military simulator but actually its a running simulator, where you spend 90% of the time sprinting while looking for enemies, 5% of the time in a vehicle that you managed to find, 4% of the time shooting at black dots 300m away you assume are people, and 1% of the time actually killing a person im exaggerating of course, but still you spend a lot of time running in the middle of nowhere",1

"the most realistic military simulator ever made. i wish there were better and more animations for the infantry like running for cover, auto-jump obstacles, realistic animations for entering vehicles, more realistic damage,hit and destruction systems, for soldiers, vehicles and buildings. and of-course smarter ai. the campaign was also disappointing. i know its an mp game mainly but a solid campaign with many, many missions that keep the user busy for lots of hours + taking advantage of all the things the game has to offer is a big plus in my book. other than that... highly recommended military sim!!! well done bis!",1
"i hated this game at first, i was not a big fan of arma it was so overwhelming. i finally sat down to give it a good ty and i have to say this gaem looks awesome and plays awesome. buy it.",2

"may seam glitchy.... depends if youve played it then the glitches have practically been removed, if not then enjoy this master piece of huge! multiplayer is awesome not played too much of the single player but presume thats just as good. tip: read the many controls before playing otherwise... game over for you my friend. overall great game, depends what youre in to.",1

"best shoote...er simulater ive ever had the pleasure to play. cod is for toddlers, bf is for kids. if youre a real man, or trying to emulate one; buy this game.",1
"this software is beautiful, absolutely. but the game play is slow and frustrating, making it a negative experience. the ai is absurdly accurate too; you can hide back as far as you want and it doesnt help.... you could have run so far that those enemies are tiny dots even through your scope, hidden under a few bushes and trees a long ways away, and they will still repeatedly headshot you. then you can spend another eternity getting back to where you were in that mission. a few minor bugs aside, i found a couple bugs with the checkpoint system; one example is in an early mission where you are swimming from a boat to attack a small village with a few scuba buddies... but on several occassions that i restarted that mission the npcs would go completely brain-dead and do exactly nothing. it is a gorgeous product, i just wish there was a high quality game with it.",1
"what a amazing freerome roleplay game best there is",2
"its arma ii with better graphics, dont get me wrong, thats not a bad thing. + looks great, the graphics are excellent, sharp textures and nice lighting. + real virtuality 4, a better engine. + mod support, this is what makes the arma - series unique. + an okay-ish singleplayer. + multiplayer, battle-royale in particular :) - the futuristic setting doesnt feel futuristic at all, it feels boring. the rhs-mod fixes this, but still... - a little variation in the weapons, all nato guns look and feel the same, a on of bullpups in the game aswell... - multiplayer issues, the servers performance affects the players performance, meaning if the server runs like crap and is filled with script, expect your framerate to tank, a lot. - clunky animations. - vehicles are like paper. not much bad things to say about this game. the mods will keep this interesting for a long time. 9/10",1
"if youre like myself and enjoy a fully immersive and realistic experience in a fps, then youll enjoy arma 3. also, while youre at it, try it with the playerunknowns battle royale mod for true heart palpitating intensity!",1
"+1 plus one for me great game when it comes to the mods... my heart has never jumped out of my chest from pvp in a long time...",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. the realism is outstanding.",1
"best game ever! this game provides endless amount of fun and its amazing! worth the buy!",1
"this game is absolutly amazing it is so freaking fun, u can play solo, with friend or even on opfor and bluefor, i feel powerful when people see my guns and run, now simulation umm well yea sure if u consiter towing as magicly floating behind the car towing then yea but hey if u forget about all the other things then yea 10/10 would pay for again",2
"ive never tried the previous arma games before arma 3, and ive never played anything like arma. its a hardcore military sim that honestly isnt for everyone. but playing this games, there are many spectacular moments that no other game can compare. the sheer strategy and timing required in a well planned mission is intriguing. the bility to edit maps and create custom missions along with steam workshop integration makes the experience more enjoyable.",2
"shot a go kart with a sniper rifle and it took out a city block. 11/10",3
"fantastic game but oh so many bugs nearly 2 yrs after release",1
"fun but annoying to download gamemodes xd 0/10 would recommend.",1
"this is really great game the graphics are sexy playing with your friends is mad banter yep what more do you want?",1
"arma series is the are the only real tacrical shooter games. if you value real warfare simulation and tactical style of gameplay, you must buy it asap! damn good!",2
"its a nice game. its good if you are into slow and tactical shooters unlike a run and gun call of duty, also a good step up from battlefield. its pretty realistic so no one man armies in this one.",2
"arma three is one hell of a joyride, in this action pack- just ing buy the game and play it for yourself!",2
"this game is very fun to troll on. and the gameplay can be intense. definately recommend to anyone who wants a fun time.",1
"great, very realistic war game. one thing id look out for is to watch your specs when playing this game because you need a fairly high-end computer to be able to run this game with good enough graphics that the game doesnt look like play-doh the graphics are wonderful, especially if youre coming from arma 2. the gameplay is good, though the controls themselves can be a bit difficult to get used to if its your first time to arma. other than that, the game is great and there is much more to do in the game than just battles as people have made zombie and roleplaying mods which can also be played online! ive played this tremendously myself and have an ongoing series for my channel, if anyone is interested in seeing the game being played firsthand then feel free to check out my series here:",3
"very awesome game, simulates how war is very well, if you liked arma 2, you will love this. you can play online such as wasteland which is fun. ive had this game since they released it.",1
"arma 3? more like ar-this  is not fun. i played arma 2 a fair bit and it was fun, but this game just didnt peak any of my interests.  the people who forced me to buy this -ma 3",1

"wasteland is great fun with friends and the game is very pretty, map could use some more development but other than that its an all round fun experience. i would not recomend this game to anyone with sub-standard hardware as this is no fun with anything less than 40 fps.",1
"hands down, the best combat sim out on the market!! on a scale of 1-10... i give it an 11!! by far my favorite pc game. looking forward to all new dlc and up coming series releases. with rumors of arma 4 in 2015 you know i will be pre-ordering!",1
"this was an amazing game, im so glad that i had a chance to try it on the free weekend.",1
"for the true infantry simulation experience the arma series for me is the only choice. ive been a player of these games since the release of the original operation flashpoint: cold war crisis back in june 2001. arma3 solidly builds on the pedigree built up by the previous games, retaining the essential feel of them whilst adding many new and much welcome features. the new highly customisable inventory is a great improvement allowing the adjustment of clothing, personal equipment and weapons and weapon accessories. some people may complain about the state of in game features like missions and the campaign at release but arma/ofp has always been more than just the game that was initially purchased to me. it is about what the game will become as bi and the modding community especially works its magic over the coming years. quite simply a pc classic which will hopefully continue to grow.",1
"this is a must have game its a war simulator its op!!",1
"they should rename this game to helicopter crash simulator 3",1
"any1 have a spare copy im looking for 1. thank you",1
"i got the this on the free wekend and nly killed one person 10/10",1
"how could this still be this bad.. still playing arma2 witch is much better",1
"this game is a must play! 10/10 would bang.... :/ its amazing! the best military simulator!",1
"maybe one of the best military sims out there. its multiplayer could use some work, has bugs, but its early access. to some people, the $50 price tag may seem like mush but, its totaly worth it",1
"i was killed and i spawned in the middle of nowhere began running to god knows where suddenly i heard the sounds of a plane looked up there it was it landed smoothly in front of me 2 men came out, i was cautious but i didnt shoot just yet would you like to join us on our space adventure? hell ing yes i will we got in about 13km in the air were struck by lightning pilot says dont worry, i can land us safely alright ok cool pilot turns off engine we crash into a mountain they both died but i survived looted their bodies note to self: never go on space adventures",1
"after a hundred hours of gametime i still discover more feutures... truly an amazing game. not recomended for immature people because you will be hated on. if you sound like a kid it will take alot of time for your squad mates to trust you",2
"this is the greatest game in the world my only complaint is i cant seem to get passed the part where you shoot your instructor in the head during the training mission",1
"this is the military game that ive always wanted to play. sadly you need a high end gaming computer just to play it. i was given a copy of alpha lite and it wouldnt open because i dont have a gaming computer. ive heard great things about this game but do not buy this if you dont have a gaming computer.",1
"i love everything about the game from flying to the gamemodes theres just so many hours in this game that its totaly worth it becuase theres nods o plenty and its just fun to play with or without friends",2
"dont take the graphics for granted. this game is hard.",1
"good game, but needs alot more addons. arma 2 did it better",2
"this game is buggy as , have fun clipping through walls and spawning outside of the map, physics... its like from one of those indian movies, if you hit something you gonna feel the impact after few seconds. do not buy this game.",1
"bravo, check your ing fire before lobbing fourty mike mikes. alpha, you were cool, 10/10 would sweep streets with. charlie, you took too long ing around in the minefield. suppressors or bust.",2
"the greatest game i have ever played, if you are looking to go in the military or currently in the military this simulator is for you. even if you are not in the military but love the armed forces this game teaches alot reading maps, combat skills, etc.... this game was made by the best for the best.",1
"sometimes when i fly in a chopper, i like to look into the eyes of my copilot while i purposely fly into a mountain.",1
"arma one of the greatest combat simulators of all time, armed assault may run  on my pc but i wont lie its still fun as hell.",1
"how do i have the option to write a review. when i dont even own this game ???",1
"very nice game i played arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrowhead and they have step it up really nicely the multiplayer server engines could be a bit better but apart from that its a masterpiece of fps games.",5
"you like realistic military games? than this game is for you! arma series has impressed me yet again. steam workshop for this game pretty much adds a brand new game to arma 3. i use to play the deathmatch for arma or the coop for arma but now i find myself playing stratis life which is a life simulator. game gets updated a lot and adds new stuff every month. game is worth every penny pros open world military game everything is driveable small caves firefights are intense cons dlc are overpriced buggy",1
"one the the best fps game i ever played no no no its thee best fps game i ever played. if u havnt dl yet i highly recommend to. hmu on steam if u want to squad up, iampandemic6.",2
"way too expensive. it could have been so much better, if only they had optimised it for non-nasa pcs.",1
"seriously get this, cause you get access to the beta and full release as well and the price will go up when the beta and full come out so save money!",1
"konene dobr, dos relna hra :) finally good, really real game :)",1
"easily the worst game ive ever played. tldr: waste of money.",1
"awesome game that makes cod and bf4 look stupid. if you have a lot of spare time on your hands then go for it. 9/10",1
"amazing game 10/10 very realistic stunning graphics and amazing gameplay from playing a mod to koth",4
"one of the best military simulators/shooters to date. gameplay, stunning visuals, vastness of the map (both of maps, actually), good sound and user-created content with workshop integration (mods and missions are easy to instal). the game is awesome! but friendly ai is dumb sometimes. 9/10",1
"very much worth the money, however you need a power computer to run it acceptably.",1
"good graphics and sexy  music all it needs now is b****s",3
"ive pondered purchasing this game many times over the last year. ive never played an arma title. i regret not purchasing it the first time it crossed my mind.",1
"great, immersive shooter! do not recommend for call of duty players, it is nothing like cod!",1
"ur last update sukx so bad. what did it for me is yall changed the sniping scopes to 10x zoom max and u cant even snipe with that, im a longrange sniper that snipes from 2 km and have to the 60x zoom that was on the sos and until u bring it back im done with ur game, i am not recommending this anymore because of what u did bohemia. this used to be the best game ever until they changed sniper scopes max zoom bohemia yall suk, not everyone uses marksman rifles some people use the sniper rifles and actually snipe people from 2 km with the llr and if u dont put the scopes the way they used im going to uninstall, rightn now its not going to be played, u got a week to fix it or i will uninstall, and give really bad reviews on every single site",2
"great game... buy it. no regret. multiplayer server is crowded with enthusiast people...",1
"amazing game! alot of different community made gamemodes available.",1
"shot a tank with a javelin, 5 guys popped out and exploded.",1
"i started playing arma back when gamespy was still around, a friend of mine recommended me that i should buy arma 2 combined operations and from that point on i was totally hooked to this game. different mission types in multiplayer mode makes this an awesome game. arma 3 has some framerate issues and numerous bugs but that doesnt make it a bad game. it is so freakin awesome to shoot enemies from long ranges without getting spotted every single time. this is a game that really puts your aiming skills to test. would recommend this to anyone who is interested of a realistic war simulator.",1
"this game requires you to be heads-up at all times. the campaign always keeps you on edge, and the variety of multiplayer gamemodes gives you plenty to take part in online.",1
"i play arma 3 since alpha, it has changed alot since first builds all in plus. its currently best game to buy if you think about tactical fps game, and also it isnt just that you buy arma and its all you get. arma 3 like arma 2 is a platform that allows modders to create completly different game modes that developers originally designed, also the game has a lot of devs attention. dlc-s like zeus make this game even more interesting and avilible even for non scripting gamer society. only thing i wish to see in future arma 3 development is more dlc (no matter if free or not if it bring lots of new stuff) and directx12 witch will help to improve performance.",2
"i do reccomend this game, as far as military sims go there is none finer. the mod support is wonderfull essentially turning one game into several possabilities.( altis life, breaking point, epoch, and the regular wasteland) not to mention the hundreds upon hundreds of single player mods. the graphics are stunning when compared to arma 2 as the improvemts to the ui and over all controll of character and game elements make it much smoother than its predicessor. on the negative side are bohemias ugly dlc content. the karts are cool and for the now price of 1.99$ sure why not. however the newest installment of arma3 choppers is a cash grab ripoff, allow me to explain. this dlc offers 2 choppers that were already in game, that just couldnt be piloted. essentially they added a little scripting tweak to allow players to use them some other supportive bells and whistles to go along with them and stuck it with a 16$ price tag....i cringe to see what the upcoming marksman dlc offers compared to the price. buy the game, well worth the money...however i would hold off on purchasing dlc untill the price drops, which it will inevitably do.",2
"at first, i realized that my gaming pc could not run armo 3. i spent years becoming a doctorate graduate in theoretical physics to have access to a supercomputer. the supercomputer was able to achieve an astonoshing -1 fps, something i didnt think was possible. as a result, it divided by zero and the universe collapsed. 6.9/10, would play again.",1
"great game, not much content as in arma ii but i hope there will be updates and mods to play :) 9/10",1
"very fun with friends if you know what you are doing, and even alone!",1
"extremely fun military simulation. beautfiul simulation and great controls/gameplay. but the thing i love the most i altis life gamemode in multiplayer its one of the best thing iv ever played theres so many options to do whatever you like.",2
"fantastic game. no regrets at all about buying it. 10/10",2
"unless you are a really, really big fan of the operation flashpoint lineage, avoid this. avoid it until they see their stocks plummet so far into the ground that they finally decide to get off their lazy  and fix this piece of  up. its been, what, two years now? its still a leaky piece of  with major fps and performance problems of which, mind you, 3/4th of these issues come from the original operation flashpoint. litteraly nothing has been done to remove any of these issues and it very obviously shows. only pick this up if you dont have any of the previous itterations, its exactly the same, minus a few gameplay tweaks.",5
"i want it b ut cant get it yet. :( looks like ill play dayz mod for now because standalone rubbish.",1
"reccommended for high end pcs and a stable internet connection. low end pcs can still enjoy the game.",1
"great game even though it still has some issues on altis but i definetly recommend it, its worth every penny",1
"i bought this game on a whim. i have not played any of the previous arma games in the series. what little knowledge i had of this game is from the few time my favorite twitch streamer choose to play battle royale. the grainy streams do not do this game justice. i was quite surprised just how large the download file was. but when i first booted it up and started the campaign i realized why. this game is ing gorgeous. the sounds... i have shivers thinking about the eargasm i had. single player gameplay, i have just the first part of the campaign. the feels. im there, on the ground, bullets ing flying everywhere. where are they coming from!? the squad leader is calm as . how? i dont ing know! then he dies, and the next ranked officer takes over like nothing happens. holy  mate, that er just died and now youre telling me were advancing!? at least let me take the poor guys ammo - cause i cant shoot properly under this much stress. multiplayer game play... i do not have. i have no friends to play this with. why? because they have store bought computers/laptops. also, its just not worth it to play this game on minimum settings. i also live in hawaii (with hawaii internet speeds), far from most multiplayer severs. but, i still like this game.",1
"arma 3 is an amazing game with an amazing community. beat the campaign and the showcases? you can go over to the workshop and download some more maps. want to play a map made by you? hop on to the mission editor and make the mission however you want, and if you want to, post it on the workshop. the game itself has amazing combat mechanics, accurate portrayal of real firefights, and can provide hours of amazing fun.",1
"if youre a fan of arma 2 then youll really enjoy this game. there have been tons of graphical improvement made to the engine which make it much more enjoyable. personally, i didnt enjoy arma 2 or this release. arma 3 is just much of the same in the arma series. most of the modules and features are half finished, the ai is god awful, and it seems that bohemia just released an open world game and expected modders to do the rest of the work.",1
"this game is worth every cent. it is extremely realistic and has provided hours of fun for me and my friends.",1
"a great game, fun to play with friends. honestly, i feel a bit ripped off by the lack of content provided by the developers, and the gameplay seems aimed at entertaining the call of duty/battlefield fps crowd. they continue to update it with new content, but it just doesnt hold my interest very long. not to mention the many unrealistic features they added in to make it combat seem more fluid and fast if you are overflowing with $$$, and you feel like buying it, go ahead. i would not recommend buying it just yet.",1
"strong aspect of competative and imursive gameplay. its really good, superbly realistic. id strongly recommend trying arma 3 out for the mods such as breaking point, among others whilst checking out the custom campaigns/missions. or even try and create your own to share!",1
"good game with lots of potential modding and other advantages nothing like cod or bf4 this game is one of a kind.",3
"im loving it, and the mods make this game incredibly addicting and also gives it more replay value than any other game. best game for multiplay on the pc in my opinion.",4
"children play call of duty, boys play battlefield, men play arma.",2
"this game can appeal to every type of player due to its verstility and ability to be changed. if someone wants action they can make a map restricting players ar a.i. to that town for close quarter engagements. if someone wants to play a realsim server and wait for hq to get a mission, and assign it to squads after the recon team has gone to a nearby hill and marked enemy locations, you can. arma 3 is the most versatile game where anyone can find what they want to play. armas engine can handle a lot of people per server and still runs the game really well despite there being 40+ people shooting at each other.",1
"love this game , great community and people have the best of servers. the a3l stolen stuff drama is fun to watch ;) love a bit of drama , great altis life servers out there and also some amazing mods to play with. i am aiming to finish the campaign soon since im finding it semi difficult but i will get there ;p 10/10 would bang again play*",3
"the best war game i ever played before. before arma 3, i always thought that bf4 is better, but after i played arma 3, arma 3 is better. you have to buy this game, and try it.",1
"with the amount of community support, this game is a must buy.",2
"probably the best tactical milsim out there, wasteland is pretty good as far as multiplayer goes. insurgencys also worth a look if you like this.",1
"4 reasons to buy arma iii. 1. i looked at the horizon and saw a hemmt going to space, i had to double-check if i wasnt playing any space related games. 2. a guy hitted the brakes and got thrown out of his car. 3. a medic was driving on the mainroad, i heard his sirenes and suddenly boom and an offroad flew through the sky. 4. freaking people using go-karts as rocket proppelant. 100/10 altis space program",2
"playerunknowns battle royale - easily the best mod",1
"it have alots of grafix in this game. i like this game alot.",1
"great military simulator, which will make you play for many hours with all the stuff do. the game looks really good for the huge map, and if you have friends to play with the games fun factor completely changes. you can plan operation and do them with your friends and you will feel like you are actually in the army. (but then you realize you sitting on your chair yelling at your friends through the mic.) everyone should get this game, not just because it is great fun, because it shows true teamwork and co-ordination. hope this helped with your decision :)",3
"amazing game!, has many things to do and have never been bored playing. full of cheap dlcs you can easly spend 50+ hours on this game, for what it costs its worth it!",3
"this was for sure one of the best early release purchase ever. + great scenarios, open maps, logical and interesting missions, good characters, realistic weapons - really complicated controls and sometimes not so user friendly (but that will not disscourage arma fans) for people who dont mind spending hours learning how to play a game. its one of the best military simulation fps out there! highly recommended!",1
"ground combat. air combat. underwater combat. vehicular combat. this game has a lot of combats! its good but the armor system must die!",4
"arma 3 is a good game for everyone who likes the feeling of beeing in a warzone or just a solider driving cars and flying planes all around the map makes it a fun game that is hard to get sick of",1
"this game changed my life i now am able to get all the females",5
"much wow, much fun. went diving, found a ai patrol, threw a nade, and killed myself.",1
"an absouloutly sh*t game. cannot stress enough how bad i find it. the minimal gamemodes along with their boring opportunities make this game a complete waste of money. 40 for this? its not worth 10! in the near future it may improve; it needs to improve drastically to appeal to me, at least. as a simulator, outstanding. as a game, made to play for enjoyment and having fun, useless. i find more fun in the call of duty and angry birds franchise. not fun! not enjoyable! not worth it! bohemia need to up their game or, they will definately, definately decrease in sales. do not buy this piece of horse crap.",1
"arma is an extremely fun, open game which anyone can enjoy. it truly is the military simulator and there are a lot of people that take this game extremely seriously so watch out for that. the various mods for this in the workshop and online are extremely entertaining and fun to play and as soon as you have money for this game, buy it. be wary of the price though, you might want to wait for a sale or shop around.",1
"there is no computer in the world that has red orchestra 1 and 2 , dcs black shark - a10 and doesnt have this game. no need to describe my experience with this game. the possibilities are endless.",4
"i find arma 3 hard to play. its single player is though, the ai is merciless and some game mechanics are hard to get under control. but wow, arma 3 really comes to live when you play this game online with other people. there are tons of good, fun servers you could lose yourself in for days. doing missions taking hours at an end, under professional leadership from an hq, pilots, squad leaders and your mates. you get to know them. you dont want to die. you leave no man behind. and after a while, you try to take leadership. and people give you that. the game is though, the community takes that, and owns that toughness by making the rules on yourself as a player though. no lone wolfing, this isnt battlefield. this is a battlefield.",1
"not the same, some might like the futuristic appeal but i dont.not yet.",2
"is a really fun game a most buy game if you have a beast pc because i have a gtx 670 and in some server i can bearly get 60 fps or 40",1
"best shooter game i have ever played! hands down the best graphics too. when playing, you actually feel like you are there. you also have the millitary tactics that your squad does. most of the people that play this were in the millitary! i give this game a 9.5/10.",2
"good single player, great coop multiplayer...when it works. the servers are rather sketchy, they dont run very well and there are hackers waiting to ruin your experience. just this past week one of the servers was hacked 3 times! but, it is fun and when you get on a server that is good it is worth all the trouble. but, the most annoying thing to me is this has only been out for a year or so and the coop servers are already kinda dead and this is dissapointing. most people only play altis life, the role playing section of the game, which id rather just play gta online. if this is on sale, buy it. wouldnt shell out the full $60 on it though. if you love tactical games such as ghost recon and rainbow six, this is your game. all in all 8/10.",1
"arma 3 is a really niche experience. it is refreshing to play an arma game when the market is so saturated with mw type military shooters. to truly appreciate the realism and immersion of arma 3 you have to find a good server to play on. i have not played a game in recent memory that provides the realism that this one does and the community is really the driving force behind that. the gameplay is solid, but the learning curve is somewhat larger than your average shooter. combat is not in your face, but tends to be long range engagements that last a significant amount of time. the single player options are decent, and provide a good means for learning the game, but you should not buy this game if you are looking for a single player experience. my only other significant complaint is how poorly optimized this game is. it is a pretty game, very pretty actually, but it runs so poorly on even decent rigs that it can become quite frustrating. 7.5/10",1
"the experiences in this game, are unforgetable and only happen in this game. it can feel like a movie, except youre in it, and youre the main character. this game is a must buy, and i mean that when i say it. beware though, once you get it, theres no going back.",1

"the aiming and shooting is , ive tried everything i could think of, changing mouse sensitivity and quality but it doesnt seem to have any kind of effect at all, its unplayable, waste of money",1
"although many fans of the arma series have been critical of certain aspects of this game(such as the choice to make it based in the future) i would still highly recommend this game to any fan of fps, rpg, or strategy game types. the base game is basically fps, but the modding community has expanded its basic description to meet other gamers needs(including my own). this game has a strong/loyal fan base, and has for years. if you dont try this game at some point you honestly havent lived!",5

"initially, i bought this game because i wanted to play wasteland or something coming from arma 2. this was back in alpha. it sucked , and i left the game to collect dust for a long time, then one day when it finally got released, a whole new gaming experience overwhelmed me! completely swept me off my feet with the mechanics that this game has to offer, and due to one of the latest updates being zeus it has made gaming to a whole new level. since becomming a fan of the arma 3 i now own 2 servers for a community named stdelta. its the most fun you could have with a war simulator you could ever have your hands on. would definately reccomend this game to any gamers looking for a challenge in their gaming. live long and drop the the floor and do the dinosaur. ~hash",3
"ran on an amd 420 core 69ghz cpu with 50 ssds and four titan xs, got 20 fps ran on an intel atom 1 core 1mhz cpu with no gpu, 300fps 11/10 would buy expensive amd rig again",1
"i love this game, but i have a screenshaking problem that has persisted over many updates. ive posted in the troubleshooting forum to no avail, and ive looked it up online and tried dozens of troubleshooting processes. nothing has worked. i payed full price for a game i cant play, kinda sucks. r9 280x 6gb, amd fx6300, 8gb ram.",1
"really great game, good mechanics, plenty of mods. fast fun experience and easy to learn controls suitible for all gamers.",1
"very stressful to just get the game to boot up.. it looks like a fun game but ill have to say no to this game.",1
"oh man, where do i begin? the gritty atmosphere; the ambushes, taking fire and running for cover yeah, the realism in this simulator is phenomenal! would i recommend arma 3 to my friends? you bet your a** i would! how would i rate arma 3? 25/10 recommended getting this!",1
"really fun realistic shooter a must have for first of third person shooters",1
"overall a decent game but with some major issues, game play is ok although ai is buggy and also cheat (knows you are behind them when they have no idea). movement is jurky especially when prone and trying to move through door ways, potentially getting you killed or spotted (since you will stand up randomly behind cover) and the saving on the campaign is awful and unfair. (you can only save once when on a patrol or mission and you will have to replay parts of missions over and over again) the wide variety of guns and vehicles is great, however the game engine in its current stake is far from complete and needs a overhall, very dissapointing. the game could be a lot better. mods help the game flourish and so does the community and server game modes. overall rating 6/10 needs a lot of improvement.",1
"amazing military simulator, a bit lacking in content in comparison from arma2, but improves from the former in so many ways.",3
"i played altis life only, and had a couple of enjoyable hours with a few friends there. dont know about the military simulation, but i have to express a clear reccomendation based on altis life alone, so the rest doesnt even have to be good :)",1

"game uses battleye, which recently banned me without reason. (you read this and go yeah yeah, stop cheating. but i am a very competitive player and i dont cheat. sucks that you can go buy arma 3 (60 dollars) arma 2 co (20 dollars) and dayz (30 dollars) to have battleye ban you for absolutely nothing. 110 dollars down the drain.",2
"joined a game, flew a helicopter into enemy territory, sneaked into an enemy base to try to revive my friend, got shot as the base was being bombed. 11/10 would almost cry again",1
"if you are an arma fan, this game will change all that. when you spen 60$ and your computer cant run it, it will be because your computer is crappy. when you are disappointed in the complete lack of content compared to other arma games, you will be called spoiled. when there is nothing to do offline, no point or story its because its still in the works even though its a full release. when you cant eek out better than 10fps no matter what your specs, its because you didnt tweak enough. when you cant find a server to play on its because you dont know the right clan. when you do get on a server and it lags, greifs and glitches, its because you play on crappy servers. when you dont think its realistic, its not a sim. when you cant have any shootem up fun like bf its because it is a sim. when all your other games run like a champ and are fun but not arma3, its not fair to compare. when you voice any of the above views here or the bi forums you are a liar.",4
"an amazing sandbox full of custom missions which would never make you bored.",1
"i love the mulitplayer you will have a blast trust me bros..",1
"poor fps. the life moeds are a bunch of fun if you feel like meeting new people. wasteland is also fun. i only reccommend this if you think you can run it, make sure you do research before you purchase it.",1

"this game is amazing. while the campaign is not what you should by the game for multiplayer modes are the greatest thing you can play. modes like wasteland and altis life are great. if you have to buy one game this should be it.",1
"amazing game, amazing mods. no other game gives you this kind of experience. ive dropped hours in this game and never regretted it. i recommend picking up eridanus insurrection or breaking point/overpoch(take your pick there). little cpu hog, so be careful on that end. amd cpus have issues and if your cpu isnt a decent one youre going to chug along. otherwise worth every penny.",2
"fun tactical game. dayz has made it to it so makes it twice as fun. play it for your opinion.",1
"im sure this is a great game. if i ever figure out how to play it to any acceptable level, ill let you know how it goes.",1
"a very fun, military game that gets really intense.",1
"i bought it a week ago and still cant play it ive tried everything even asked steam for help still nothig sucks when you buy a 60 dollar game and cant even play it this is the first and last game im going to buy from steam",1
"great game would recomend that anyone who is anything should buy this game.",1
"this game is awesome but you must have a very good config",1
"this game is trash. arma 2 with updated graphics and controls. you cant run for more than 10 seconds at a time because everyone is overweight apparantly. just ruins the game. cant go anywhere quickly unless its in a vehicle. awful... was going to buy if it was like 10 bucks at christmas sale but not anymore. this game blows just like arma 2. the only thing arma 2 had going for it is dayz mod. and even that got old.",1
"amazingly fun and interactive game to play with a group of people .",1
"please give me back my time what i spend playing this excellent game :d",2
"easily one of the most immersive games ive ever played, im totally hooked and it is a massive step up from arma 2 in terms of graphics. also as a bonus it actually runs better on my macbook than arma 2 did with the details all set to high. i can see myself losing so many hours into this and ive not even finished the campaign or opened the editor. (check out the whole lotta altis mission in the steam workshop for a brilliant and massive mission too.",1
"incredible game if ones rig can handle the beauty!",1
"this game is awesome if you like simulation. this is a tactical army simulator. it has really fun multiplay and a editor where you can create missions, and co-op missions. you can also post your map creation on steam. it does not have many mods on the workshop but i dont think it need alot of mods for a cool game like this. i totally recommend this for anyone that like shooting games. but of course i got my copy on sale for $38.99, or around there but thats the digital one, i think its called something like that. i like this game so much im thinking about doing a series on this game. thank you for anyone for taking the time to read this. :)",1
"youre paying 5 more than we did for alpha release. get it if you have the ram.",1
"logged on. got kidnapped. had my kidneys stolen. fell off a building and died...10/10 would buy again!",1
"this now has more vehicles, armored vehicles, and new helicopters! i am loving it!",1
"arma 3 makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons. this time around its trump card is steam workshop integration though, making downloading mods effortless. a smart move by bohemia interactive because it are those mods that will give arma 3 its long lifespan. unfortunately arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesnt seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. space time and perseverance are your best friends here, until bohemias support starts paying off.",1
"best multiplayer shooter ever. if you like dayz, and like the feel of battlefield or something. get this game. the multiplayer has massive maps with amazing combat and realistic systems. good simulator. buy it now! definetly worth your money! p.s. dont expect to get good instantly... it takes some time... i can tell...",1
"probably one of the best fps, military simulator, with endless user add-on and mods i have ever played in my life. its to the point this game is the only one i still play. its far from call of duty and sort of reminds me of the old battlefield games but better. i give it a 10/10 not for the game only but the the continuous community and their mods.",2
"free for a weekend played it for 24 hours, great game",3
"singleplayer was ok but multiplayer was hard as hell (immpossible). the arma games get worse each release. if u want a good arma game play arma gold edition.",1
"arma 3 itself is meh. but when you start to dive into the games mods it really starts to shine.",1
"this game is very nice. have some bugs but still the best xd",1
"this is the best arma game by far. the altis life servers are amazing",1
"poor fps. the life moeds are a bunch of fun if you feel like meeting new people. wasteland is also fun. i only reccommend this if you think you can run it, make sure you do research before you purchase it.",1
"solid graphics, but too many issues.. 1. swaying is extremely unrealistic, your character literally sways his gun so much it could be considered an arm excercise <.< 2. enemy skill is unbelievable.. they can literally shoot you from 200 yards away with iron sights while you are slightly out of cover prone (lowest enemy ai settings applied) 3. after shooting an enemy, their bodies bend like the bullet applies an incredible amount of force 4. squad ai and ui is so wonky that i would rather just follow than lead.. 5. it doesnt feel rewarding to complete missions, its like i accomplished nothing i am only recommending this game because its challenging and visually exceptional. however, if you are looking for a game that isnt extremely frustrating at points this isnt for you. i really hope these issues are resolved..",1
"a sprawling, complex, beautiful, terrifying simulacrum of war.",1
"awesome team based shooter. multiplayer has horrible coding tho, sometimes you gotta play with 20fps with any computer you own",1

"i am hiding behind a rock , the bullets richohet on the rocks top and hit the grass behind me. its a foggy day so i cant see much , puting my head out would kill me. i need to work out were the enemie is shooting me from befor they can flank me. so i observe the impact on the grass behind me , i can barly work out based on the impact of bullets from what direction they are firing. i peak out shoot about 10 burst in there direction and toss a grenade. i go back to hiding and crawl behind a tree that was near the rock. i can hear or see the enemie but i dont know if i killed them. so i slowly walk in a half sercle around the grenade impact. i see that they both went to were i was last. i aim , shoot and kill them both. non of this was a scriptied event it just happened. armaiii , like all arma games is a military sim that depends on both the devs and moders to give you the best military simulation out there.",2
"this is the greatest game in the world my only complaint is i cant seem to get passed the part where you shoot your instructor in the head during the training mission",1
"this is a really good fps and simulator that allows you to create your own mission and play as one of the soldiers.",1
"arma 3 offen used as a combat sim for clans can be boring and demanding but the game itself is great the game looks and feals like an open world combat game, with that being said the community behind it are very much the weakist link in the game modders clans and servers all think they own the game they like to play i am higher ranked then you! moders dont code in the best way they can and then lie about what the games engine can and cant do, there are fine pepole out there playing this game but mp is as with every other game full of pepole you would like to punch in real life. is it worth the money? for single player alone this game is worth it and mp/mods are the 2th best thing in the game if you liked arma 2 you will also like arma 3. arma 3 is only an upgrade to the already great arma 2 new maps and content leave this game fealing freash and new. the one thing i hate the most about the game is the fact that it is based on prototype tanks planes atc they are not real! and this leaves the game fealing like a peace of the future not what i like imo",1

"an awesome game, been playing since arma 1 and it never failed to satisfy my cravings for war.",1
"i cant even update it... i tried to delay the update but now it says that the update is paused whenever its finished updating. i tried to uninstall it but now it wont install... waste of money and time",2
"this game is very fun and continues to supprise me every second. i highly recomend it to even to short minded people",1
"its pretty intense on the right moments. if you want intense firefights you should play domination.l but if you like to play strategic. you should also play that lol. wasteland on the other hand. is boring as . lots of vehicles planes and helis. you can bomb  and there lots of weapons. 8.2/10 best war simulator of the year -pc gamer",1
"its a amazing simulator, it has amazing communcation techniuges the bring gamers toghethor and make them use there brain more.",1
"if your tired of playing cod or any unrealistic fps then arma 3 is the game for you. ive never played a more realistic fps or milsim game. arma 3 delivers as the best milsim on the market today. dont wait buy now!!!",1

"a military simulator and the best one out there. no questions asked. you have a passion to play in huge conflicts with or against other people, use tanks, helicopters, airplanes, boats... then this is the game for you! note: for best experience, find a community to play with since public servers can have s in em.",3
"cool game, very complicated controls. do not attempt with a controller and be prepared to spend hours learning which keys do what.",1

"3.5/10 if you are a passive and slow in playing game this is the right game for you. it is too slow and has soo many glitches you have no idea!! i will give it credit becase it is like skyrim, free roaming type but the controls are too much and in general, it sucks, i would recomend no getting thi sgame and not wasting your 60 bucks, keeps it for something better. please, dont buy this game.",1
"youre basically buying the engine, the game itself is  the only satisfaction youll get from a3 is from the community made maps and mods therefore i can not recommend this",2
"awesome game. i thought i wouldnt run it on a geforce gt 530 but i did with 35-40 fps on medium settings. overall; game experience is amazing if youre using mods and of course its a tatical military shooter therefor... amazing.",1

"still the barebones - barely even a game. unless youre sure youre going to jump on the bandwagon, hold off on your purchase.",1
"ai is deadly accurate no matter what obstacle, trees, bushes, walls, it doesnt matter, every helicopter gunner as aim like a crack sniper and with one hit kills. friendly ai is dumb as a sack of door-knobs controls are very complex, combine this with poor auto save implementation and this quickly becomes a no-win nightmare which will force you to reload an entire mission, most of which take an hour or more to complete. unless you have 30 or so buddies to play multi with, i recommend you pass.",1
"had a sniper rifle once, missed every shot. died to a cliff. realism.",1
"this game was fun has some bugs online but not to much with 3, more with 2 i cant even get online im stuck with singleplayer after paying all my poket money. but this game made me forget about it as so much better with graphics, and gameplay more involed and more adds, and updates as you play this game threw the years to come.",3
"after the steep learning curve its really good fun. beware, it seems very graphics intensive.",1
"asked an ai to 1v1 me and his buddy killed me. freakin noobs.",1
"great game but fps is really  for me in mp i have a great pc with geforce 970 card and still i get 30/35 fps on mp. singleplayer is broken in some places so overall not a great game",1
"forget battlefield and call of duty, arma is as good as it gets when it comes to military based gameplay. the best army simulation i have played to date with such a wide variety of game modes, both modded and vanilla. i highly recommend that you purchase this game if you havent done already, you wont regret it.",1
"chased around by exploding red people for hours. 12/4 best 5 hours spent in my life",5
"greates millitary sim ever made, if realism interests you then buy it. 11/10 would play again.",1

"best military sim out there. you can do anything and the community is great. alot of addons to download, missions and people even make awsome gamemodes.",1
"has its bugs here and there but the fact its crafted for modular addition gameplay is what i love about it.",3
"an amazing game however this new update has made it so i cant join any servers",1
"very good game, good simulation with intense long range combats and ai who can shoot accurately without being gods. on the other hand the game is still quite buggy, especially with the main scenario (had to reload old saves quite a few times) and with movements when in a house, especially when crouching or proning. you also need a good computer to play online decently (i have to degrade my settings and play with no more than ~50 players) 7.5/10 overall",1
"the quintessential first person military sim for the seasoned military shooter fan or first-person shooter players looking for a bit of depth and substance in a game. this aint arcadey casual rambo cod or battlefield rubbish folks. this is the real-world modelled experience every fps player *should* be looking for. and if you havent been... you need to take a long hard look in the mirror and tell yourself to lay off the drugs.",1
"this game is a worthy successor to the ofp franchise and arma 2, my favorite games of all time.",1
"even though i have the crapest laptop soon ill get a gaming pc i love this game i get 15 to 19 fps and so what i still enjoyed playing atlas life,the campaing and other servers.i also like to watch psi syndicate,frankieonpcin1080p and i think lyric plas arma 3 but i love watching them play.if you have a very good p then your in luck for this game i recommend the game to hardcore fps fans out there (with good pcs).",1

"game with realistic battle but this isnt realistic. that has realistic only graphics and some physics nothing more. shooting and aim with use gun is ******. dont make more game with yours realistic. multiplayer isnt optimization and i can play only single player with stable fps. campaign mode is sometime nice but are some places where game is totally ******. arma 3 has yet much lacking aspects. game is not worth this price. 3/10",1
"so i give this game a 1/10. i was playing it and it started to bug out, and then i saw a person. this person was dressed like ben10 and was going yoooooy. so i walked up to them and i was like spongbob patrick and my friend is being a arma. so then that arma went yoooy yoooy yooo and it spongebobed all the way up to the house to mr krabs, who was weirdly dressed like vass from far cry 3 and pearl was dressed like jason.",1
"fan-freakin tastic! its all youd want in a wargame, unfourtunately i cannot say the same about the download space. still great game overall.",4
"epic. intense. scary. ptsd simulator 2014. maybe you should buy it.",1
"im a new commer to arma. bought the alpha back in march i think. its not an easy game to learn but it delivers some incrediblly satisfying moments if your patient to wait and play the game the way it was ment to be played. the graphics are really really good. can play on high settings with my gtx 570. the steam workshop missions are awesome, some are as simple as a simple rescue mission or a destroying a convoy all the way up to being in charge of over 100 soilders, helicopters, drones, and tanks taking over 3-4 towns down a highway to the main airfield on altis. this game is awesome.",1
"i have always been a fan of the arma series because its really different than the other shooters. there are so many different ways to play this game, i spend hours scripting and fooling around in the editor for my own enjoyment. i dont play multiplayer that much but its still a great experience when i get to it. this game is very heavily gpu and cpu dependant so i wouldnt reccomend this to people who have a low-mid range gaming pc. mid ranges might still be able to run it but you will get lots of fps drops below 30 fps. this game is really fun and easy to get into. i am proud of the work that bohemia interactive is doing and continue to be a fan of their titles. i rate this game a 9.5/10.",1
"got kidnapped by a gang called isis, they forced me to rob a bank with them, then took me into the mountains and made me fill up their helicopter with heroin and cocaine. when i was done, they got ready to sacrafice me for allah, just as they were about to kill me, they police showed up on mass, and killed them all. one of the commanders had responded to my desperate texts, he gave me some food and a free backpack. the system works, would get kidnapped again. 10/10",1
"quite possibly the best miltary simulator of all time",1

"in my humble opinion its the gentlemens shooter of 2014. if you like you multiplayer a bit quicker try a wasteland server in your region. friends recommended but not required.",1
"overall a well rounded, well put together game with a vast community. whether its role-play, co-op, pvp, or pve the community has made and played them all. the game is constantly evolving and constantlly being tweaked and fixed. the progression on the game from alpha to the latest version is by far some of the best work and dedication i have ever seen out of any dev teams, even that of some triple-a titles. if youre looking for a serious gamestyle there are many different realizm groups around to show you the ropes. if your more of a relaxed weekend warrior, the winners of the make arma not war competion for multiplayer missions, kink of the hill has what your blood thirsty hands are looking for. from survival to out right blowing  up this is what your looking for!",3
"best game ive ever purchased in my lifetime. the modding community is off the charts along with the game itself. if you have the money. i reccomend purchasing it with no regrets. best on steam in my opinion.",2
"arma 3 is a combat simulator, meaning that it is realistic and has great physics. the campaign is interesting and has enough combat and action so you dont get bored easily. there are many modes/mods to play on arma 3 like wasteland, altis life, domination, king of the hill, team deathmatch, etc. arma 3s editor is awesome and allows you to make simple bases, missions, or expirements or complex bases, missions, and expirements. the game is $60usd but is definitely worth buying if youre interested in games that include a sandbox, several gamemodes, and many ways to play. if you dont believe the game is worth buying, check out videos on youtube about several of the game modes in the game and decide off the gameplay you see.",2
"you dont buy crack for sometime in the future just like you dont buy arma if you plan on going to work the next day...",2
"this is truly the best game ive ever played. buy it. youll have a blast. i recommend that you take a little time to learn/tweak the key mapping (or if the default keys are to your liking, keep them) and do a few tutorials on weapons. there is a lot of control in this game and it can be used to your advantage. after over 300 hrs i can only think of two things that i wish were different; modders help us! 1- we need knives as a weapon choice. sneaking up behind a sniper while hes not watching his back... a knife would be nice.... 2- i would prefer more rudder authority on the helis or at least a sensitivity option for it. the current seems a little bit lacking in that department.(like it was set up for first time pilots to learn to fly) all in all, i highly recommend this game and give it a big two thumbs up",3
"revised my review as my last one it was only in alpha, but things have only got better. the possibilitys with this game are almost endless, the multiplayer is by far the most, enjoyable i have played. with so many different game modes, and mods available, you can never get bored. play with your friends and the fun just multiplies. dont get me wrong it has its problems, bugs are still there, and altis can be annoying at times with its lack of cover, but it is a real island, and if they strayed away and changed it, then i wouldnt be altis. the best thing with this game tho is its realism, when one bullet can take you down, and end your day. it adds a fear factor into the game play, where you seek real cover, use real line of sights, and have to make corrections for the ballistics of the weapons. its not for everyone. but any hardcore sim gamer will love this, its still has the arma feel to it, which was something i first thought it would loose. play it. for me, its a 9/10.",5
"i go into the game and play on a server where we were rebels and fighting the ai un. i started as a simple medic then about 3 minutes in im suddenly leading 40 mean agianst a few hundred ai. on our first mission we were trying to land in on the west coast and we went into town and encountered 2 ifvs and we die. but on the next mission were caturing airfields with the trucks choppers and tanks we needed. so we mount up and with our 2 tanks and support from the choppers we start heading an attack on a un fort. even though we lost both tanks we killed 12 tanks and cptured 3 choppers and split the un forces on the island in half. most of the rest of the game was clearing out towns and cities until we started hitting the uns airfields and forts. soon though i was leading 20 men into a large town. suddenly the ai drops 6 choppers and were digging to fight for our lives. me and one friend escaped meeting up with a strike team to the north. it was one hell of a ride.",1
"epic realistic and the altis and stratis is on greece 9/10",1
"this game is gold. you can do what you want when you want. really easy to do mission and a lot of option to use.",4
"one of these best games out there. you do how ever need a strong pc to play on high graphics but even on the lowest setting i still love it. final grade 97/100 (for a few bugs that have only happened one)",1
"good game, recommend playing with people you know and with voice. good mods are blastcore_a3, cba_a3, jsrs2, sthud_a3 and tao_foldmap_a3!",2
"this game is legit and amazing. the devs try not to call it a sim but its as close as you can get while still being a game. its very realistic with damage and weight models. body armor and helmets give a degree of protection. the same applies to the variation of vehicles in the game. the 2 maps are huge and there are plans for dlc in the future which will no doubt add on to that. speaking of addons the giant mod community for the game is always hard at work making new missions, weapons, and vehicles to add into the game free of charge. there is endless replayablility with this game and if youre a shooter/military game fan then this should be in your library. honestly, if the game was more optimised (insane cpu usage for projectile physics and ai decision making) i wouldnt even play half of the other shooters that are out today because arma does it all and more. pick this game up!",3
"best 900 hours of my life. thank you bohemia! everyone get this game!!!",5

"the battleye service is absolute ! i got banned for purchasing a vehicle on altis life i do not recommend this game!",1
"many hours of fun. especially the new overpoch mods. love the angry mannequins",1
"arma3 at first can seem a fairly complex game, which does take time to fully understand - however you need to remember that this is a simuation not a battlefield esk game. once you remember this you can come to terms with the game itself and in all, what a game it is. pros; gameplay/modes controls graphics multiplayer replayablity cons; tasking on system low fps in multiplayer without going into a full blown write up of this game, if you can set some time aside to learn the controls and the basic fundermentals of the game then you should enjoy it. the multiplayer is where i would say the game holds its own, think battlefield with alot more realism and mods. if you decide to pick it up, i doubt youll regret it.",2
"amazing graphics and pretty cool gameplay got it in alpha so it was only 30bucks get it on sale as it doesnt merit 60$ yet imo",1
"its a great game. to bad i cant afford to put even 5 dollars towards it.",3
"the previous title, arma 2 in my opinion, is in ways better than the third installment.",1
"amazing military sandbox, endless opportunities for games. king of the hill, wasteland, find what suits you and youll have a blast, i guarantee it ;)",2
"this is a ing  game breaking point does not working for me gayness and you cant alt tab out cuz its ing  gaame.",1
"this game is well amazing ive clocked almost 300 hours on it in the past 6 months im abolultly in love with the wasleland aspect of this game 10/10 great game!",2
"imagine a game that was completed by the developers. who routinely worked to upkeep, maintain and fix any lingering issues. this is not that game. 2 years in the making and it feels just like dayz alpha. incomplete, bug filled and constant dlcs that you can buy but dont expect anything to be fixed or working in any of it. waste of money and time.",1
"pros: arma 3 is a realilistic game with really good graphics and massaive maps that give the player the ability to decide how they are going to apporach their enemy. the multiplayer is really fun and their a ton of servers aswell, also modding is fun and easy with arma 3 and it comes with its own mission editor too. cons: the game is really difficult to play and will take anyone some time to get use to. arma 3 has a ton of controls that the player has to learn and commanding a squad in some missions can become a nightmare when your a.i. team mates decide to either not shoot at the enemy even after telling to open fire or running in front of something you told them to hide behind and getting shoot. i would recommend arma 3 for its realistic experence that i have only found in the arma series. you should check out arma 2 and day z standalone too.",2
"1st/3rd person military shooter with vehicle combat. one of a kind modern military shooter, with very large battlefields. a lot of clothing, armor, weapon variations, weapon modifications, ammo types, grenades, utility tools and different kind of equipment. large variety of civilian, military, armored ground and air vehicles. game has great modding tools and support. single player missions also included, as well as co-op and multiplayer modes. game has great visuals, texture quality, animations, environments and good voice acting. inventory is hard to navigate at first, and needs getting used to. you tend to die fast, and for some people it may be a challenge to stay alive. game supports large player count on any given map. personally i think this is good improvement over arma 2.",1
"do not buy this game, unless you are ready for constant 15 fps on multiplayer no matter what your graphic settings are. this game is really badly optimized and you will probably not get any better framerates unless you have a supercomputer. i get 15 fps with all my settings turned as low as possible and 14-15 fps when playing all maxed out. singleplayer works nicely tho.",1
"its like arma 1.5 but with better graphics and less content.",1
"a masterpiece. with the infinite amount of content, amazing textures and deteals, huge map, fun dlcs, and amazing controls, this game is one of the if not the best games on the market to this date. ive put 72 hours roughly into this game and it still keeps bringing me back for more. between altis life, wasteland, amazing workshop content, and dlcs/campaign there is no stop to the endless things this game has to offer. the team based strategies of wasteland multiplayer are amazing. you find awesome people in team speak and after the server i always find myself adding more and more people to my friends list. with the excitement of finding enemy weapon crate stashes, abandoned helicopters and tanks, a huge fight between opfor and blufor teams, and if your lucky a jet is something that always makes me want to play wasteland 24/7. if you are reading this review and are deciding on wether to buy this game or not, there are many things to take into acount. this game will not be very much fun with a bad/mediocre computer. although the computing power demands of this game are high please buy this game and you will find how fun and exciting everything about this game is. thanks for reading.",1
"for those not familiar with the arma series, this is a game unlike any other you have ever played. arma 3 is a wonderful game alone and an even better game with the mods to include breaking point and newly relesased epoch. this is a game that will never be uninstalled because its has constant replay value and every time i play it is different.",3
"so much more for your dollar compared to the big gaming system games. endless gaming options with tons of mini games inside the game popping up all the time. i highly recommend this game to almost everyone, seems to have something to offer for all types (not just first person shooters). gather your friends and dont expect to leave your computer for quite awhile. the only thing i would suggest is getting all the altis life servers updated with vehicles, jobs and weapons.",1
"fak, need windows 98 to run dis sheet. my gtx titan said no and blew up.",1
"do not buy it! the cpu and gpu issues are so bad you will get 17fps slideshow in multiplayer on low/med/norm/high/vhigh/ultra settings, its a shame this game had a lot of potential, singleplayer is great but donr expect anything more then that. it will never be optimized for high end gaming rigs. bohemia are uselss and dont even care about the issues!",4
"i have owned this game for about 3 months now and i have almost no complaints about the game. you need real skill in the battle field to do good and you need good planning for an operation. 9/10 only because you cant go prone on stairs, this is a free world bohmia and if i want to go prone on on the stair then i should be able to.",1
"great game. not like anyother games ive played. its a really good team playing game. so many different aspects to enjoy. its a serious game but has relaxed game modes in it.",1
"this game is unique and has many bugs but extremely enjoyable and there is plenty to do to keep you busy.",3
"not sure about the base game but mods like battle royale make this game very fun!",1
"game is great....very tactial would recommend.....but mp has low fps at the moment",1
"so hardcore my pc melts down after playing it for a couple of minutes... so cool that everytime you watch the trailer it gives a chill effect... so tatcital it can be considered a strategy game... so wanted that my friends tryed to stole my pc to play it... so innovative and accurate game mechanics that cod looks like kids playground... -its =arma 3= gentleman, one of the best and most realistic military simulator title out there. i wish my pc could handle its awesomeness to play it...",1
"if by chance you are fortunate to be right-handed, use default controls at all times, dont mind that even this comes with several impairing elements, dont mind tons of glitches and unstable content, dont mind wading through to find actual significant content yourself or want to put in dozens of hours of effort to make content in a steep and vague learning curve...then this game is the best a military simulation can do for now.",1
"i would definately recomend this game to people who like semi-realistic warfare. it has unpresidented modding support which allows just about anything you could imagine in the game. it has a vast number of custom gamemodes and thousands of mods. 9/10 really really good.",1
"waste of money even the real weapon doesnt move alot when you aim. graphics was good but when you aim its moves around alot dont know what they are trying to prove. even when i fire my m249 machine gune i can zero like in cicle but the weapon inthis game sucks.",1
"played this game for 3 straight hours, went to bed with ptsd. woke up without pants. no one says you have to sleep with pants on. 11/10",1
"awesome fun, get it, think of this as a good version of bf4... but bigger and more real, and it is absolutely amazing graphics quality wise and the gameplay is the same :d",2
"alot like arma2, graphics and some very slight phisics updates. though these games usually improve with age.",1
"best military simulation. also some of the best mods ever keep this game rolling forever. br never gets boring, other mods are a good time filler as well. i would reccomend bohemia to get battle royal as offical piece of the game. prints money.",1
"the amount of times i have been blown up by a naked guy in a head wrap has been mastic, so i don my tight rudder suit and do the same",1
"children play call of duty boys play battlefield men play arma",1
"yeah  this game. buggy as  and increasingly so with every god damn update they release.",1
"deep engine, challenging gameplay, unique story, kickass guns. i officially love this game",1
"ive had this game for 3 days... i already have 34 hours on it",1
"the game its self is pretty , its altis life that makes this game.",1
"amazing experience. just dont play after playing cod.",1
"arma 3 is just as boring as arma 2 until you play king of the hill. koth makes this game, its the best. worth the cash money just for that mode alone. why? progression, teamwork. and last but not least, friendly helicopter pilots will drop you onto the hill of death just for , giggles and points. 10/5 oh by the way, its unoptimized like every arma game, so to make it go from 20fps to 90fps you need to balance out cpu and gpu performance.",2
"good game, great community, awesome graphics. loads of oppertunity and addons. 10/10",1
"military simulator which achieves so much, whether it be the single player modes or one of the extensive multiplayer modes, this game will keep you hooked.",1
"so much opportunity in this game. mods being produced every day with a lot on the horizon. definite purchase for anyone interested in milsim, fps, and rpg.",3
"hopped in a rhib and went to the airfield during the night, took a fuel truck from enemys then went and took a tank and blew up a new spawn in a sports car 10/10 this game is only really good if you have friends, and willing to download mods, and be able to put up with home made servers, and spawn kill in wasteland, and jets in wasteland etc",2
"not optimized well, takes a beast of a pc to get above 15-20 frames on altis in kavala -- but damn its a great game.",2
"you can pretend to be dead 10/10 it really works.....",1
"in zeus mode you can spawn hundreds of goats and blow them all up with artillery.... goty right here boys!",2
"10/10 best walking simulator on the market, would walk again",4
"best infantry simulator. only the flight model for fixed and rotary wing aircraft is complete crap.",1
"this game lets you have the freedom and creativity to make/play the battles your way. this is not for the casual gamer nor the gamer who gets easily frustrated - most likely caused by the ais complete stupidity and the terrible damage models. however, this game is stunning. the lighting, shadows and texture quality really push any pc to the limit. i could go on about the bad points, but its the good aspects of this game which really sets it apart from the rest. if i had to give it a score out of ten - 8/10.",1
"so realistic that i die in one shot 11/10 would buy again",1
"this a a great game for some one who likes combat games, but wants a realistic system. i fully injoy playing this game. i think that it has somthing that everyone likes. people can make their own mission host their own games and even modify the game if they want to. if you like simulators like minecraft and also like first person shooters i recommend that you get this game.",1
"great game, a must have for fans of fps games. there are so many different things you can do with this game.",3
"i love this game more than selena gomez. (thats a lot) :)",1
"after playing in a few ops with my team. i can, honestly, say that arma 3 was worth the $59.99. it is so realitic that it adds so much immersion that it makes you feel like you are there fighting the good fight. 10/10 will buy arma 4 if they make one.",1
"if you want to get a game with bugs and so on. get this one. and arma 2 ofc",1
"if youre looking for a in-depth military simulator, look no futher, because this is the best youre going to get. also look out for its extensive catagory of mods such as breaking point.",1
"i love this game to bits. my only problem is my pc isnt that powerfull, so i cant experiance the whole moment. im going to get this game for my friend, and would do so if i could with everyone in the world.",1
"1st day of arma3 me and my friend both just bought the game and installed it super hype start joining game arma crashed restart arma need to download mods for server ragequit 2nd day of arma 3 me and my friend still hyped now have mods join server server goes down, who knows why try joining different server get into altis life start picking peaches for 4 hours straight make enough money to buy firearms licenses and guns go pick cannabis almost get shot at in cannabis field by fellow novice criminals for being mistaken as cops get to cannabis processing get shot in the head by a fully armed rebel friend gets away in car 20 mins later car disappears in the middle of a highway and my friend has to walk back over 30km on foot finally meet up in main city on map get blown up by rebels ragequit, join wasteland server spawn with my friend fully armed and ready to go start arguing over who drives a beat-up army truck get attacked by enemy rifleman kill enemy and start looting his corpse naked friendly mistakes us for enemies and decides to suicide bombs us starts shouting allahu akbar and playing classical music blows up my first experience of arma 3 9/11 would bomb again",1
"great military sandbox. limitless missions, insane cooperative missions, and amazing graphics. top notch game!",1
"highly suggest getting this game. i found it highly addictive, and love making new missions. also if you dont have a decent pc dont bother, arma 3 is best at its full quality and i couldnt stand playing it when my old computer couldnt handle it.",2
"this game is awesome if you dont have it i would buy it.",4
"arma 3 is a good game. its very different from fps fast action shooters and by all means its not a war simulator. if you have a high spec gaming pc you can enjoy great graphics and gameplay. the only thing i dont like about this game is ai.",2
"arma is a great game if you want a military simulator. until you die by a rock..... 10/10 would play again",3
"this game is fantastic for the militaristic loving fps and 3rd person shooter fan. as everyone says, it isnt the game to do benchmarking with. its tough to make this game look amazing all the time without tearing or frame drops. i wouldnt buy this game at full price for that reason alone. i got it on sale and i do not regret it at all. if it werent for the fps issues, i would buy it at full price. the mechanics are good, the multiplayer is great, the mods are fun, the dlc is sick, etc., etc.",1
"ive been waiting for a game like this my whole life without even knowning it. quite possibly the best shooting game ever made.",1
"arma 3 is a masterpiece that i think will be played for a a long time! this game has beautiful graphics of terrain and objects. gameplay mechanics are quite easy to learn but becoming a master takes time and practice, you maybe able to kill from 100 meters but you will have to train to kill at 1000. there are a wide selection of weapons and clothing for your charicter, ranging from ghille suits to civillian clothing. where i think this game shines is the scale of combat, with two absolutly huge maps and combat scenarios arma will never give you the same scenario twice! this isnt any arcade shooter, arma is a tactical shooter, some would even call it a role-playing game! summary: buy this game if you have a moderatly powerfull pc!",1
"now that dayz is out id say its not worth buying this, it was pretty fun for awhile though.",2
"an excellent game that is a refreshing option compared to the other shooters in the gaming industry.",1
"the arma3 is a massive military sandbox games that it has very true surrounding and experience.you can play a large number of mods that it build by players.i think it is very amazing.i played the wastland and the alits life mod.i felt that there is a real world i within it. if you are a military affairs fans,you should buy this game even it will cost 59.9 dollars.if you arent ,dont buy this one believe me the arma3 is a terrible game and wast your 59.9 bucks.",1
"-spawn -get in chopper -get shot down by aimbot enemies -repeat 10/10",3
"amazing military simulator, all the console peasants are jealous their peasant machines cant run a game as good as arma.",2
"amazing game #runslikea great times had on free trail",1
"i really recommend this game. the game itself is a very tactical war simulation but not only that, you can play with thousands of mods for that game and missions, etc. graphic: - very nice graphics - one year old graphics but are still as good as new games gameplay: - simple steerings - easy driving and flying - sometimes unreal physics (flipping cars, sadly no/not much weigth physics in cars,trucks,choppers and planes) - you can do almost everything e.g. wasteland, braking point, altis life, king of the hill, battle royale (and many more) but all in all i can highly recommend this game, me and my friends had and have a lot of fun with this game.",3
"*highly recommended* this is one of the best strategy action simulators i have played since arma ii. looks beautiful if you have top range pc. one downside is that it is highly intensive on your cpu and i cannot recommend this for low end computers/laptops. you never run out of things to do, due to the steam workshop and level editor where mahy people create great game types and areas for combat. i give a 9/10",1
"if you havnt already played any arma titles youre missing out so why not start now?",2
"best walking cross country simulator 2014, also has speed up function.",1
"good game its awesome only problem the fps is below 10 4 me and i have a very good computer :/",1
"after trying for about 5 hours in vain to just get past a small phase in a mission in the game, i can finally say i gave up. above the insanely hardcore combat system, i got killed countless times by mines that i cant understand how to tell their location, so its just a simple, annoying, random death. also the game has a lot of bugs, mainly graphic. id say the devs rushed too much. 5/10 game health, 3/10 gameplay, 8/10 graphics, -30/10 gameplay forgiveness. bought the game when it was 50% off and i regret spending every and each $ for this game which i just cant play.",1
"brilliant game. when it first came out, the game was buggy, glitchy, and pretty much unplayable. but that was to be expected. now its a brilliant combat simulator which i love to play in my spare time. easy on the frames, great scenery, and awesome weapons. the update on the physics engine was on par as well. but i would say they need to dumb down the fatigue system. after running 50 metres with heavy gear and becoming fatigued is to be expected, but the character waves around the gun like hes aiming for a fast moving dragonfly. but thats the only thing they need to work on. overall, this game is a must in your steam library list. 10/10",1
"better than battlefield. better than call of duty.",1
"think if skyrim and battlefield had a baby and then it started doing meth.",1
"arma 3 is not quite a first person shooter, it really is more of a war simulator overall. it is highly detailed and looks great visually but there can be a bit of a learning curve. the games strong point, in my opinion is the way it tries to do multiplayer, where you make missions and what not. i find this single feature what makes arma stand out the best. more shooters should have the level of control arma 3 gives players. there were a few cons to all of its pros though, so i will list my biggest as follows. 1. multiplayer servers (if not set up properly and efficiently) can make the game squat down and take a huge dump on your fps (frames per second) 2. i feel the multiplayer user interface could use some work. making the game more accessible to new players. 3. better single player. arma may be best for its multiplayer but i think overall more work could be done making the single player experience more enjoyable. all in all i think arma 3 does the shooter/ war simulation best, it may not be as popular as games like cod or battlefield but thats not a bad thing. imagine if it was that popular, then we would be dealing with those guys...",1
"fuken climb in the bushes m8, shoot the biches get the girl, alright",2
"for some this might be a teriffic game. for others, who dont want to spend 20+ hours figuring out the keybindings, it will not be. lots of great hardcore simulation options and when you get together with a group who knows what theyre doing, it can be fun. if youre looking for a casual shooter, this is not for you.",1
"great game for anyone looking for a realistic war game. probably the closest thing youll actually get to shooting people. 10 potatoes/10 mushrooms.",1
"needs better veicle vs player gunplay, if someone is in a helicopter the people on the ground have no chance.",1
"fantastic shooter/milatary sim butstill need to fix mini bugs but they dont really matter :d",1
"i reccomend only if you have a computer that can handle it. also the controlls arnt easy.",1
"this game is fun, plenty of mods to play, to get the most out of it work as a team, thats what this game was made for!",1
"amazing graphics, fun game to play. glad to see all the mod support.",1
"bohimia interactive did an amazing job on this game, be it from the smart ai to just sheer graphics. this game is absoultly breathtaking and i recommend it to anyone who likes any sort of strategy game with action involved. when bullets are flying over your head you really feel like youre getting shot at and adrenaline kicks in. the news zues module is an amazing asset for those who wish to train others and its just plain fun! 10/10",1
"i would recommend this game at full price. totaly worth it. i barly know anything about the millitary or fps and i picked it up really quicky. fun to screw around on multiplayer and other gamemodes.",1
"this could be a great game but is way too demanding....my pc beats the minimum requirements and still runs laggy no matter the setting even on the lowest settings its still bad,,,,,dont buy unless you have a high performance pc or it will be a waste of money. keep in mind what ive described above was on solo/single player, online is much worse even if its a dedicated server. dont click the buy button you have been warned",4
"a great mil-sim, although its poorly optimized, which is the biggest problem with the game. even with a gtx 780 and a 4770k, i can still only manage 25 fps in cities.",2
"i hope most if not all of the bugs and issues there are fixed through beta and release. for an alpha it was very impressive but i feel there is still some work to do to make the game the best it can possibly be and with a price of 19.99 ($32.99   24.99) is almost idiotic to pass up. i imagine on full release that price will go to the normal price for a new game on steam, either 29.99 or 39.99, so get it while its hot.",1
"arma 3 is an extremely versitile game, one can do everything from run heroin in altis life to attack the talaban using the agressors mod, to do military simulations with your realism group of choice. arma 3 is worth every penny; you wil never run out of things to do and see. by far the best game i have every played i saw someone get robbed on the steps to a courthouse 10/10",2
"for those who have doubt about arma 3 because of the instability and glitchiness of arma 2 rest assured, arma 3 is very well optimised and way more stable, i had doubts but thanks to the free weekend i now know that it wont make my computer swoon. also its a ton of fun by the way.",1
"dont question me... just buy this game and play altis life immediately under the multiplayer options. youre welcome.",4
"if youre looking to implement tactics, this is the game by far. i highly reccomend this game to anyone wanting to escape the mundane fps genre.",5
"everybody who has win8.1 stay away from this game it has bugs band bugs and bugs for exaple soome keys are not working i cant even cahnge it because i somehow cant get my mouse calibrated",1
"the overall experience you get from arma games is good. but bugs are to be expected. the game feels like an actual war simulator. one shot can either kill or hurt badly, medkits are must have and the missions are a fun experience. the game is reccomended when you have a couple of friends with you. it gets dull and boring if you are alone (like any other game) but with friends the whole satisfaction is improved.",1
"this pc game is a must have for all high/medium end pc owners! this game is what i consider, next gen gaming!",3
"arma 3 will kick any cod or bf player straight in the privates if you try any of that run and gun bs. from being a long time battlefield fan from ps3 to pc, arma was a change of pace for me. i got sucked into dayz for arma 2 and never turned back. when i saw arma 3 coming out i knew i had to pick it up, better graphics, gameplay, map, just better everything. some do say that the parralax on the ground is annoying or the way the clouds spin with you a certian way but in all honesty, the game is some of the most fun ive had with a hyper-realistic military sandbox. very well made besides a few bugs but thats something that just kinda comes with a game of this size.",1
"amazing game. new to the arma series and its the best realistic fps game to date. 10/10 c: more cpu hungry then gpu, just an fyi.",1
"7/10 single player is fine. mods can make sp a fun experience. but once you try mp, thats a solid no unless you play wasteland or on a private server. the fps on any server running a custom game mode is terrible. it is higly unlikely you will get above 30 fps on a public server. i cant speak for private servers but if you want to play mp, play wasteland or find a group that has their own not-bad private server. only recommended because of sp",1
"well love the game but got banned by battel eye and i have never cheated!!! but the game still rocks!!",3
"this game has set the benchmark for military simulaton gaming, bis have done it again with this edition to the arma francise, with the quality of everything in the game, the realistic movement of units, the weapon discipline, graphics, game physics, vehicles and everything else. this is a game that is a sound investment whether youre a hardcore milsim player, someone with an interest in the military or if youre a casual gamer, the way bis developed the game, youll be playing it for weeks, if not monthes trying to discover everything in the game to do and see. with the modding community rocking the gaming world as well, the modders have be given the ultimate baseplate to start their work on, the marriage of bis game development and quality mods is a match made in heaven. i would say that this is a game that every steam user should have in their game library :) thanks you bis, please release more unreal content and games.",1
"the best game in history of fps. it has everything you need and everything youll ever want, including what you never thought of. arma 3 has not only the freedom for the player to choose whether or not he wants to play it like a real soldier or a complete crazy call of duty kid playing for his first time. the problem of arma 3, for now, are the variety of maps available for all players and the hard time that you have to download other servers mods, because if that is not being placed on the table, its a really great game.",4
"ive got to say, this game is truly great in most ways.ive played for how long i do not know but i did play a lot, the problem is you play for hours and hours with doing almost nothing to just get killed by someone who has all the stuff...",1
"injected with real life elements with a dose of ptsd on the side your mind will be focused but! wait.. dont attack alone...because in this game teamwork is key.. and that is what this game flows upon team work it has a charm that no other game can create worth the 60 dollars and the dlc package this is by far the most i mean the most amazing game ive ever played",2
"it looks sweet, runs good but the controller layout is all over the place and you cant change it :/",1
"this game was released in september 2013 without a single player campaign. part 1 of 3 dlc s to add it was released in october. its now christmas and and whilst there has been other updates for multiplayer, the final 2 dlcs that add the missing single player campaign are no where in sight.... it will probably be years before we see them and the fan boys will consider that good service.... personally i do not.... my advice... save your money for something else.",1
"im sure this is a great game if you like using a keyboard and mouse, but i dont. you cant map fire to the right trigger button on xbox controller, or change axis on preset. googled the problem and found that many people have complained about this for a long time now. if they cant be bothered to fix this then i cant be bothered buying the game.",1
"if you want to drive bad  tanks, jets, or helicopters that are all armed to the teeth buy this game, if you want fun cooperative gameplay and tactical, realistic fire fights, buy this game. the realism is insane, from actually needing a first aid kit to treat a wound, to having to find parts to repair a vehicle this game is sweet!",2

"arma 3 is one of the best games i play; with its large maps and units. even after the singleplayer and senarios are finished you can do things such as: the editor, multiplayer or zeus. something to do in arma 3 that i would recomend is to go on a co-op server, such as ahoyworldss invade and annex servers, and play with other people against infantry ai. but even if you find the amount of equipment (e.g. tanks or guns) you can always mod the game. the arma modding comunity is huge, for example if you want to use less modern weapons, you can probably find it, even if you want to scrap the military aspect you can get things such as altislife. therefore i think that this game is a seriously good game and i would recommend it to others.",3

"awesome game! the realism and teamwork is amazing. although i was dissapointed when all the vehicles from arma 2 werent used in this one.",2
"i give this a thumbs down, not becaue its a war simulator and im looking for another cod, but because its so glitchy, that every time i feel like im starting to be immersed in the game, it knockes me back out. i use the binos to see where enemy troops are and it just decides that i have selected another item and pulls that out. i change from my rifle to my pistol and it changes back by itself 10 seconds later. it just loses all feel to it, and when it happens and it gets you killed it just makes you think it not worth it. i wouldnt buy till they can iron out these issues. on the posive side the actual game would have good potential without that issue.",1
"your team is moving in a complex and strategic formation into enemy territory to neutralize hostile troops&infantry and seize the area. as a vulnerable and mortal soldier, you really feel how teamwork and cooperation is the essential key to survival and success. call in airstrikes, mobilize the approach. people yelling and screaming commands, explosions and gunfire. this game has the best movement mechanics and combat mechanics i have ever experienced. the single-player story is good so far, and the multiplayer coop gameplay is absolutely amazingly astonishingly beautifully magnificent! watching realistic movies like black hawk down and the hurt locker really makes me want to play some more arma3. aside from that, the new map is so incredibly beautiful that i enjoy every single moment spent on it. i can just drive across the map without any action at all without being bored because of the challenging terrain and vehicle-movement, and watching the beautiful landscape.",2
"not what i expected but it was interesting and fun for a little bit",1
"tried to land helicopter on top of a car while the intire rest of the team are fighting back the enemy. car blows up. kills 3 enimies. 10/10 best noscope sim 2002",1
"fantastic sim/game. learning curve is fairly small and incredably rewarding! if you like action games, blowing sh!t up, team work, driving, flying and diving! then this is probably the best game out there!",1
"game requires a very good computer with high level specs in order to run at 30fps or more even on low graphics. i can run arma 2 on high graphics but for some reason i can barely run this game on low.",1
"my game says news offline and i cant see any severs what do i do",1
"great game! love the single player scenarios and the multiplayer servers. the different drivable vehicles add to the effect of the game and the immersion.",1
"ive been a fan of the arma series back before it was the arma series. starting with operation flashpoint: cold war crisis i was sold on this series and have been a die hard fan ever since. the arma series has always been more than the sum of its parts. the ability to create through the robust editor virtually any sort of engagement scenario you want and then play that scenario against other players or with them in coop is not anything you can find in any other milsim out there. -and make no mistake arma is a milsim. if you havent tried out this series but like the idea of being able to immerse yourself in a combat experience without long nights of firewatch while hotboxing a pack and a half of malboros then give it a go.",1
"says its running till the 27th, my free weekend no longer works on the 26th bit upset about it.",1
"less aircraft than arma 2=cost more$$ 11/10 would recomment my family and friend to buy this game for christmas",2
"inconsistent performance, but you soon forget about that when you realise the scale of battles and just how in-depth a game it is. amazing.",2
"the most realistic war simulator ever made. i wont give it a 10/10 because of its bad support for old graphics cards. 9/10",1
"after update new command code make game really good for me !!!!",1
"this game has brought me hours of fun and im sure it will bring me many more. if you have the cash, pick it up asap!",2
"highly polished arma ii with future weapons, new shooting stances, and vast detailed maps. like its predecessor the mod community makes for a highly customizable game experience now backed by steam workshop. warning: some dedicated fan boys of the arma franchise would claim this is a very smooth game, i feel while smoother than arma ii its still a far cry from being entirely smoothed out. the most popular game mode seems to be wasteland which is dayz with out zombies. as you can imagine new players often get camped and ed prior to even finding a weapon. supposedely you can port arma ii objects into arma iii, i have not tested this yet, but that proves to be some what promising for custom map design.",1
"the most accessible game in the series, this is bohemia interactives magnus opus and my favourite instalment since the days of operation flashpoint (now arma: cwc) and its incredible addons, the technological leap is huge and the possibilities for the end user are limitless, catering to any taste with a very active modding community to boot, potentially taking it far beyond a mil-sim. i have owned this game since the alpha phase and has been worth every penny, its never been perfect but the development team are constantly striving to make it so. one of the greatest titles ive had the pleasure of owning on the pc for many years.",2
"its a really good game but i wish it was a bit cheaper",1
"i really like this game i like the gamemodes for multiplayer. i liked the singleplayer it was still fun, there are a few glitches in the game but i dont care that much because it is an amazing game and i will never regret buying this game i would recommend this game4 to everyone.",2
"im surprised i actually got addicted to it! best game playing alone or online. soooo gooood!",1
"probably the best military sandbox game out there. quite a lot of bugs, might be unstable after updates, but the community is here, custom contents (mods) are a gamechanger. grab it, join a serious community, and enjoy the hell out of it.",4
"the fact that the game was released without a single-player campaign is very off-putting. the graphics are astonishing, though. the intense detail put into every single action that you do really hinders the fun aspect of the game. its more simulation than fps.",1
"this is indeed the best fps on the market. content in this game is unlimited because of the very well done editor to make a mission exactly as you want it to be. arma 3 or die ;)",1
"arma 3 is a very versitile game that has many different gamemodes within the base game.",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. you will love all the game has to offer.",1
"a great game and ever evolving sandbox! i highly recommend this game.",1
"astounding game. great graphics, gameplay, and more. whenever i played it i would feel either really relaxed or tense, no in-between. however my computer is  so i cant play it :(",1
"it is was good game it is nice and you have to try it it is good big map and tankis evrthing",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. oh and its better than call of duty! :d",1
"arma 3 is an epic military simulator. the game is highly team based on multiplayer and singleplayer. there are many servers for you to join on the multiplayer screen such as altis life. altis life is a fun role playing server. there is also breaking point which is like an arma 3 version of zombies, and domination which is real players vs the ai. even if you dont like multiplayer, there is also a lot of cool things in the workshop for you to download and use in singleplayer. i highly recommend this game to people who are looking for a real simulated military game, or else just want to be strategic with some friends. 10/10",1
"okay this game is amazing and pretty as crysis, if not, more pretty, the detail put into this game is beond imagination, its fantastic, and the game is really good, but it is a miltary sim, and not like battlefeild, its pretty much one bullet in the right spot and youre done, so you have to be patent, and to conlude this review im going to tell you the only ture con of this game, this game requires a gaming setup, it is very cpu heavy i suggest having an i7, and a good one at that, the gpu is pretty standerd requirments on this game but have a good cpu, and this game is very fun",1
"great funny but you need a good computer to run this i get 60+ fps in any gamemode.",3
"welcome to the best military simulator of all time, how??? i here you ask. because unlike cod and bf4 you dont sponge a bullet to the face!!!!!!!",1
"when i first got it, i was disappointed. but after discovering the vast amount of mods and customization with the editor, i havent stopped playing. 9.5/10",3
"i played this game for 260 hours and it was amazing. i played with friends and then got banned by battleye for no reason...i am very dissapointed in be for global banning me for no reason. i do not cheat and the worst i have done is download mods in which arma 3 has mod support. arma 3 is a overall great game but the sixty dollars is not worth it.",2
"normally i would say: arma 3 is not a good game. but that would not be fair. arma 3 has big problems. a netcode worse than the bf4 netcode, a poor framerate, at the very most an average campaign and more problems. but all that simply do not matter if it has one of the most active communities which is delivering extremely unique, exciting, funny, hard or just good modifications. and i like these kind of games. and there is the big strength of the game. unlike other developers bohemia interactive does not aim for the ultimate game. they deliver a sandbox where the players can decide what they want to do with it. you want a military simulation? well it is arma... but try other things: roleplaying in altis life, surviving in battle royale or driving a parcour up in the sky with skytrack - it is up to you. we have seen the success of dayz and i am looking forward to all the other mods which will be released in future. but: bohemia interactive! please solve the technical issues, especially the horrible desync and the poor framerates.",4
"simply awesome war simulator. the most realistic one i have ever encountered.",1
"now that dayz is out id say its not worth buying this, it was pretty fun for awhile though.",2
"full of glitches and the multiplayer is super laggy if you run on the same settings as you play on single player. it has super clunky controlls and weird animations which makes it feel unrealistic. i do not recommend this game to others",1
"this is the best game ever made for pc. it servers as a base for the 52 mods i use",4
"could easily have an 1000 hours if i didnt work and have a job.",3
"another great game in the arma seris, keep it up bohemia because im not tired of this yet! 9/10",1
"dont get it for full price, it isnt worth it. not at all.",5
"this game has so many mods anyone fan of rust , dayz , gta or any other shooter with sandbox features get this its great altis life mod wasteland awesome mods",1
"i need help i got a big lg tv and on arma the fps gose down i was thinking if i get a pc screen would that help the fps im playing on a lg big tv but every time i look up at the sky the fps gose up to 50 i get 30 fps on very high so what u think if i get a pc screen would that help the fps ????",3
"amazing game ! just that fps sucks saying i have a gtx 770 and an i7 4770k . fix fps and some glitches and id play it all day.",1
"realism enthusiasts regroup! this game is very immersive, to make you feel like you are in a war, a simulator. call of duty and battlefield players, feel free to join and man up!",2
"love it, altis life rolling around with the clans always a good time when coppas stop a car filled to the top full of heroin xd",1
"terriblly brought togther game, completely garabage engine that just sucks up all your cpu and ram for little to no graphics. net code is worse then battlefeild, this game should still be in alpha. everything is clunky and choppy, dosent run smoothly, this is something id expect from an indie game, not wroth 60$ not even worth 20$.",1
"help my arma want stop updateing but it keeps adding my gb to the total",1
"full of sweg. rate 69/21 would derp again. multiplayer is the best.",1
"when i played arma 3 during the free weekend a few weeks ago, i enjoyed it a lot and i also like the graphics and the interface. it really fits in with the players. altis life rpg - definitely recommend it, go play it...",1
"a great game -- if you can get past the bugs, of which there are plenty. id have to argue, however, that this is one of the most fun games on steam. the mission possibilities are literally endless. the people that play it -- well, you get used to them. i cant wait for the snipers dlc, ill be buying it as soon as it comes out. this is the most realistic game ive ever played, and if you like military simulators, youre going to love arma 3!",3
"arma 3 is awesome! especially battleroyale, if you dont have this game you need it!",1
"best hat trading simulator around. let your kleptomania flow.",1
"i enjoy how tactical it is. its a really fun game. cant get enough.",2
"this is a piece of  i bough  and i said i was globaly banned wtf",1
"this game will give you shivers as you play it, its just too epic. i can tell you that it is worth the price. but when it doesnt overwhelm you with epicness, it makes you laugh your  off because some random  happens from time to time, like tanks flying into space while backflipping nonstop or sudden raining men.",2
"i really have enjoyed this game. it is very fun and really realistic. the only concern is the macincs the way the shooting works is a bit diffrent so beware but other than that and some rare glitches i would recommend this game",1
"arma iii is a game you cant just casusally play, you have to experience its rich graphics and amazing detailed simulation of battle. when you have a gun in your hand you seem to take better care of it and use the minimum amount of bullets to save ammo. they is so much to explore as there is a vast multiplayer experience filled with battle royale and team deathmatches. it really is a great and fun game!",1
"ive not been playing much, but its an awesome game. for sure. :)",1
"i wouldnt buy it i got banned cause someone hacked in to my steam accout and hacked this games and i got banned 1 week after i got it",1
"i dont get the ultimate military simulation that this game advertises due to bad servers and confusing attachments. is this a bad thing? no. instead i got a hunger games style experiance with battleroyale and tried other mods such as atlis life and breaking point which i found to be entertaining to watch but not fun to play.so yes, basicly the only reason i baught arma3 is for battleroyale. is that a bad thing? no. i find battleroyale exstremely fun and there is always the opportunity to play new mods in the future. you might get this ultimate military simulation experiance but most do not. just something to keep in mind. note: alot of mods are external from the game and even steam workshop. for example to play battleroyale you have to download the withsix-play mod launcher to be able to connect to the battleroyale servers. its fairly straight forward so you shouldt have to worry to much.",1
"not for me. i regretfully spent $60 on this game because i like the dayz mod. i know some people will say its a simulator, but at the same time its a game, and its not fun at all. you randomly spawn, always in a town by your lonesome. you trek lightyears ahead to find any action or objective thats randomly changing but the moment you step out of your vehicle you get sniped from an army of dudes in the mountains. rinse and repeat. im normally a multiplayer first, kind of guy but the campaign/bootcamp is entertaining. the game is also an insane rig to run without any framerate. i shouldnt need to watch youtube videos to learn how to make the game run decent.",1
"very fun and immersive tactical shooter, if youre looking for a good game that is more acturate to real-life combat, the arma series is for you.",3
"a realistic army sim, not for the kids that enjoy call of duty. bloody amazing though.",1
"i love hand cuffing people and making them bow down and kiss my feet.",1
"we destroyed a helicopter so hard, it crashed the server 10/10",3
"arma 3, the most universal shooter you might ever need to own. back in the old days, it was half life which everyone had to own, because this piece had plenty of content which you were able to play in so many different ways that its almost impossible to count them all. and arma nower days is pretty much the same, even if youre not a fan of great and realistic combat simulations it offers massive free content via its big community which wont stop generating content until and after the next arma will be released. but be aware this game is a hefty performance eater and it can cause you alot of headache, because of its bugs. but i have no doubt right now, that most of the bugs are wiped out and the rest is still on its way to be fixed. because this game really gets the love of its makers after its final release. theres still an addon to be awaited as well as a very nice dlc and im positively looking forward to it.",4
"arma is my life. there really isnt anything better if your looking for a fps, dogfighting and cas missions. or a massive tank battle. this game is for you. will arma again for the rest of my days. thank you bohemia. this game raises and surpasses the bar of excellency.",3
"hour after hour the game can be enjoyable to an extent but with the serious lack of software support from bi-studios the game is lackluster in how it performs compared to its previous game. they still since the launch of alpha have yet to create a patch for a simplistic bug and are lazy programmers in the least. it seems that the modding community has to pick up the slack of their terrible coding to fix not only simple coding issues but also the major areas just to be able to have good mods...... pretty horrible if you ask me, i would have expected alot more coming from bi-studios.........",3
"if you like team based war games that people accualy work as a team in this is for you i rate it better than wiping your  with the softess toilet paper in the world welll eating a ribeye steak",1
"very good anyone who enjoys arma 2 or one or any fps strategy mmos should get this",1
"this game has so many bugs its rediculous realistic right if you could only get ur fps to actually b any good horrrible dont waste ur money on a game where they never gave a  in the first place.",3
"i love this game mods are the best way to make this game one of the best",5
"dont get me wrong, this game plays fine and is really, really pretty so if you are after good graphics then this is your game. it just didnt appeal to me because at the end of the day it is really boring. this is coming from a guy who has played previous armas and operation flashpoint games and this one is by far the worst. pick up arma 2 instead and install a graphics mod. its cheaper and is more fun overall. just my opinion btw so you may totally disagree if you have the game.",1
"good step in quality for the arma series, however the content is lacking at the moment for the hardcore community. im sure things will grow soon though.",1
"this is a game that shall truely test your inner soldier...",1
"amazing game..just started playing seriously about a month ago. replaces battlefield and what is call of duty?",4
"this is, hands down, the best military simulator available. there is a steep learning curve and its not very plug and play, but a3 can deliver an incredibly rewarding experience if authenticity and realism are up your alley. the arma series has proven to be both a fun combined arms shooter as well as an invaluable training tool.",1
"the best sandbox war game of the year arma 3 is a continuation to the arma series by bohemia interactive, taken to the next level. with increased player control/movement, enhanced mechanics for vehicles, weapon systems (if you buy it), flight models (if you buy it -_-), and much more! the control in tight spaces should be worked on, this is no call of duty, the controls are clunky, but are a vast improvement over the previous installment (arma 2). another of the top complaints of this game is the netcode. it is terrible under load, but again, is much better than arma 2.",3
"arma 3 continues on the merits of the original operation flashpoint and while many additions imply much welcomed improvements throughout, the core of the issues remain unresolved, leaving complexity rather than depth. it is the best version of the sandbox/editor/experiment, but as a game, it is still the flawed mess that the original flashpoint introduced back in the days. atleast flashpoint had the excuse of originality being it was the first of its kind when released, which leaves arma 3 to nothing more than minor improvements in an environment that requires massive enhancements. buy if the previous titles meant something to you to the extent of wanting to experience them in a slightly newer engine. avoid if you expected them to actually make a game of quality.",1
"good game...... exept i cant join any online match it kicks me or i have been banned and i have never used hacks so its a bit wird and thats why this game suck fix then start selling it as full version",2
"pretty awesome game. make sure you have a high spec pc though, otherwise youll miss out on the best reason to own this game - them graphics guy!",1
"game only worth playing multiplayer, and server browser almost never works. loads of potential but almost impossible to play because of this. skip this game unless you can pick it up very cheap.",1
"i really recommend this game because of its nice graphics, great singleplayer/multiplayer. i bought the arma 3 limited deluxe edition for $55,47. it contains arma 3, a map of altis and stratis, an awesome keycard, arma: cold war assault, a keyboard layout, a digital soundtrack, a digital tactical guide, digital maps and all dlcs. for its price it is just a bargain. buy it and you wont regret! :)",1
"arma 3 is a very diverse game with many different games modes and mods. some of the popular gamemodes are king of the hill, battleroyale, and wasteland. there are also many co-operative mission you can do with people if you choose to do so. you can instlal different mods like guns, vehicles, missions and other things. then theres breaking point a mod that involves zombies (be warned it is a very big download like 20+ gb) it can be hard to survive people and most people will try to kill you so be warned. last note is there is going to be a arma 3 epoch namalsk map coming.",3
"if you like war, rpg and survival this is your game but... if you like realistic physics then this is your nightmare :)",1
"game is amazing! definetely recommend it to anyone into shooter games although there is a lot of other cool things to do in the game, along with all the fun multiplayer lobbies. makes this game a ton of fun! rated 10/10.",2
"great game. graphics are amazing! you will spend days in this game.",1
"definately worth the 34.99 spent! there is so much to do on this game with amazing graphics, and smooth gameplay experience.",1
"the game is great and can be played for hours without a break, the action is smooth and unforgiving one mistake can lead to half your team being slaughtered in a matter of seconds and a swarm of enemy combatants suppressing your position. the epic landscapes that the series is know for is best represented in arma 3 with altis and stratis, two mediterranean paradises that have become the setting for a full scale conflict. my only qualms with the game is the lack of playable content thus far. though the game features three conventional factions and a guerilla faction, only two of the factions have full ground capibilities (nato and csat) leaving the other two at a disadvantage. compared with arma 2 combined operations it holds up pretty well. another problem that doesnt bother a lot of players but bothers me personally is the lack of a full campaign. the only issues that came to mind for me have been noted by bohemia and they are adding the campaign and more content for free. i would totally recommend this game if you have any interest in strategic shooters, if you liked rainbow six, battlefield, or even the less popular reboot of operation flashpoint youll find a warm home in the arma 3 community.",4
"really fun game if youre into tactical and realistic shooters.",1
"some background: i first started playing bohemia interactive games in 2001, when i played the demo for operation flashpoint from a computer gaming world disk. i owned all of the operation flashpoint expansions, as well as arma ii, and now arma iii. this game sucks sh*t. all of them have, and all of them have depended on the addons to make the game playable. bi has never made a decent game, only a platform with promise that modders/mission makers polish up. -i dont know why bi continues to make storylines, theyve always been awful at them. -ai sucks. i just fired up a mission and was told to plant explosives on some mobile artillery. the platoon leader said and everyone else take cover.. apparently a couple ai thought it best to run towards the mobile artillery, so i accidently killed them ---leading to a mission failure, and them shooting at me. -before that two soldiers got killed running off on their own (funny, never saw that in the ranger handbook) -most multiplayer servers with a decent ping are either rpg or dm... i should not have to explain why this is stupid. +voice acting gets slightly less terrible each game. +graphics are decent i dont recommend getting this unless its like 75% off and you understand what youre getting.",1
"i never expected i would get into these kind of games, im really the last one who is playing millitary simulations but with some guys the kind of the hill mode is really fun. if you never tried the game you should try it but a big but the game is horribly optimized, it crashes often, low fps, laggy.",1
"best game to ever be created especially if you have the kart dlc :d 9.333333333333/10 half life 3 confirmed?",2
"so not a fan of the 2035 setting, but the changes they made to arma are great. this game is a pc crusher and requires only the best to play it though. military realism cant be found at this level anywhere else.",2
"epic game with lots of weapons, vehicles, drones, epic islands(alits-400 km^2 of hell)",1
"if your pc can handle the amazingness then get it 123.5445454 out of 2",1
"just kinda wish this game was as popular as it was back in early 2013.... ):",2
"love the instense battles, graphics in this game. arma is always a must have",1
"brought me to my current train of thought. -never buy another video game",2
"despite the performance issues, i have to admit, i love the game. its the best military simulator available. i recommend that you have an extemely beefy pc. also, check this link. it will help with the performance.",1
"great game, need a quite powerfull computer to handle it, overall one of the best games i have ever played",1
"first off, this game is amazing. it has something to suit everyone, even though it is a military simulator. this is because of a dedicated community of modders. so if you dont want to be a soldier, get on an altis life server and fish or something. if you want the fight a gladitorial battle to the death, try battle royale. if youre into zombies there breaking point or overpoch. if you want a strict pvp mode that plays similaryly to bp or overpoch, get wasteland. there is so much that this game has to offer that i couldnt begin to list it all. this game like every other is not without flaws, however unlike many games, the dedicated community of modder also takes care of that with their own patches and fixes. seems like bohemia interactive did everything right with arma 3, and the opposite with dayz standalone.",2
"the one thing redeeming about this game was king of the hill. they just broke it witrh the newest patch. donty waste your money till they fix it because its unplayable.",2
"i love arma. but never in my life have i personally played it. i share my frustrations with you because i bought my very 1st arma computer game (arma 3), have had it for 2 days now, but still have yet to be able to play a single second of the gameplay.... it claims on steam that i have played for 72 minutes, but i have not gotten any further that then clicking play game. as it requests to make changes on my computer with microsoft directx and then crashes before the game itself pops up. i only hope that steam will be able to reply to my problems on steam support. although even from the gameplay, i recommend arma 3 to any and all computer gamers who wish to experience the closest thing to war. arma 3 is oneof the greatest games of our generation and i cant stress that enough. i cannot wait until i somehow get to play this game. i am so excited and will be playing fo 2+ hours a day guaranteed. kids play call of duty. boys play battlefield. men play arma.",1
"nothing can compare to the variety of gameplay arma iii has to offer.",5
"dont walk across altis when playing this game...youll have 30 hours by the time you hit the other side...",2
"got robbed then drop out of airplane and landed on cop car. 10/10",3
"arma 3 a good improvement more so than the previous ones, but the game still suffers from minor faults. arma so far is on top of my favorites list.",1
"honestly, this is the first arma game i have played. just getting back into pc gaming over the last two years!! this game is easily the best shooter/mil sim ever made. obviously if you know about arma there are some things that suck and are coded weirdly...that said this game was done damn near pefect, the story is one of the harders storys ive ever played, being a veteran myself you really do have to throw down tactics and watch flnaks. the online is where this game shines, from an intense filled game of king of the hill, where 3 teams fight for control of neutral objectives, with helis landing on wherever they feel for a drop off to the airborne op side in getting a flank for a building or side of the town set up. altis life is an amazing rpg style game, from police force, to gangs, to being a drug dealer, dirty cop, medic, farmer and try to live in the virtual cities. rules will vary by server on that mod. dayz sa pissing you off like it did to many of us...once you have arma3 you can play breaking point!! the best zombie survival game on the market!! class systems, vehicles, tons of weapons... if you dont arma bro you are pcing wrong!!",4
"if you like laughing your  off and fun, long game play... arma 3 is for you... updated review the game is still fun as hell, but still runs like",1
"if you liked arma 2 or even dayz, then you will love this !. arma 3 has taken it a step further by giving us a huge island of altis, and the breakingpoint dayz mod, along with dead nation dayz mod are both out and in their beta release for arma 3 arma 3 takes us into the modern army with 3 factions this time and places the war somewhere on a large 270km square meditaranian island. its a must get for any game collerction !!",5
"hands down the best military type game there is. cod and battlefield cant hold a candle to arma.",2
"arma 3 is an excellent game for 2 reasons. number one, its engaging and immersive and fun, and number two is the fact that bohemia interactive cares about its modding community (hence the competition make arma, not war). but arma 3 comes with a few flaws. chief among these, in my opinion, is optimization as i own a very good mid-level pc and i seem to be getting around 16 to 20fps. also is the lack of vehicles and weaponry, although i know that is set to change, i would have liked the game to be complete and not an about to finish up beta. but if you have some friends that are interested, then why dont you visit the islands of altis and stratis. live a new life in altis or stratis life, fight for survival in wasteland, or work together to defeat opfor ai in invade and annex. just bare in mind that this is a military simulator, so no run and gun or rendezooks here, just good ol fashioned tactical warfare.",3
"i have a fx-8350 and an r9 270x oc. on singleplayer ultra i get around 40-70 fps, avg 50 |render distance at 2500. multiplayer gamemodes with persistance high 15-30 fps |render distance 1000. severs without persistance around 45fps veryhigh-ultra |render distance 1500. there are other mods like breaking point and chenarus that are persistant, but i run 80 player servers at 40fps ultra. but this game base is mostly persistant servers with 60+ people. so i suggest a must buy if you have a i5 or i7 cpu and a nvidia gpu. if you have a amd rig, buy with caution. but further than specs, this game is really well crafted and is a magnificent game. there is nothing like it on the marketplace. at times it is a little un-realistic with weapon sway, and op npcs btu past that, pvp is awesome, the mods are awesome. 100% must buy for multiplayer.",4
"my completely fair, non biased score 91/100 ive had some of the most funny, and awe inspiring times in this combat sim. (when everything clicks, and youve clued yourself up about the sim) it is beyond how good your imagination thinks it is.. by far the best money ive ever spent, on any piece of software in my life! my words of advice would be to learn it. reel back on your rambo insticts from kiddy shooters. to get the most out of this, its best to apply yourself. if you consider yourself good at cod or battlefield - prepare to have your trousers pulled down, and  firmly spanked by seasoned tactically minded players! why this only got 74/100 is beyond me. i think part of that could be people wrongly thinking theyll jump in and kick . then the reality of them not being very good afterall sets in.. they leave and review it down. either that or they experienced some glitches which were apparent on release. ive not experienced any problems recently, most major bugs are now in the past. i think the only thing that miffs me about this sim, is the scripting little toerags that rear their ugly heads from time to time on some online server. they are usually dispatched pretty quickly though. seriously, buy this.. if you dont youre missing out on a world of entertainment!",2
"arma 3 is a very buggy game but overall it is the best fps shooter there plus there is free mods released nearly every week for the game and they cost nothing",3
"hey gamers! if you want a buggy game that feels like an alpha test for the low low price of $60 then this is the game for you! multiplayer? you will lag out and be randomly kicked to add a certain degree of excitement! hey! i finally got a bunch of weapons so i hope the game crashes and kicks me off! that could be you! here at bohemia interactive we couldnt care less about your gaming experience! we already have your money!! so hurry up and give us your hard earned cash and you can jump right in the fight, then get randomly disconnected and overwhelmed with bugs! go on! you know you want to!",2
"flying a heli in just your underwear is a great experience.. awsome visuals, cool experience",2
"outstanding the amount of detail its dust amazing also the grate multiplayer i love huge multiplayer games and this is one of them dont have anything else to say 10 out of 10",1
"new to the arma franchise. bought it 2 weeks ago, and have ridiculous ammount of hours in game already. addicting",1
"with arma, you will either love it or hate it. and if you happen to the one of the lucky ones, arma 3 will keep you coming back for years, with a vast amount of content and replayability, i dont think ive ever experienced a situation the same way twice. with a control scheme that allows for finer movements and positioning and a map that is just oozing with detail. if you enjoyed arma 2 (or arma 1 for that matter) i would spare no time in picking this one up.",2
"kickass when you can make fat stacks like heisenburg on altis life",1
"good game but seems to crash a lot! i have a high spec laptop and computer, the issue seems to be mainly with multiplayer :(",2
"arma 3 sucks it kept on fresing my comnputer every time i played it do not buy this game. wish i could get a refund!!!",1
"too difficult? its just too realistic. with the development both by bi studio and the arma community, the arma series is definity the most versatile military simulator for the moment. with great improvement in graphic quality and the ability to port arma and arma 2 into armaiii, arma iii has brought the arma series into a next level.",1
"it is a fun war sim and you can do a lot of crap that is vary fun",2
"arma 3, another great hit after the arma 2 from bohemia interactive. great open-world game. graphics are quite good, with the gameplay and game mechanics. another feature for this game it is a huge target for modders. contains many fun modes, as well many co-op modes and multiplayer modes. one of the more popular is the battle royal mod. and also the campain is very interesting. on the other hand, the bad things are mostly the optimisation. its open-world and good graphics come at a heavy price. takes a good computer to have a full expirience.",2
"great game, much better than arma 2. i recommend capture island game mode.",1
"having fun in arma then i ran my car into pd bacuse guy with gun made me and i was arrest by a  named trey",1
"this game is really fun, and has so much mods you can play. i really reccommend this game. but there is one down part to it... its addicting!",1
"if someone asks me what is the best game i have ever played, then without contemplation, i will definitely choose arma3. it has the best graphic ive ever seen, it satisfies the ultra-realism ive been looking for (i thought bf series were realistic) and last but not least, it makes gamers to jump into game-making. i doubt games better than this would come out any time because i strongly insist this is the most breath taking and innovative game ive ever seen.",4
"recommend to anyone who likes any sort of combat game. has great balance of first person combat and vehicle (sea, land and air) combat. the weapons dont customise very much, but that doesnt matter so much as there is a very wide range of weapons and attachments. very well optimised and runs smoothly on all occasions. the only problem is if you are playing online with a computer running at low settings, as you cannot see enemys as clear or as far away as those with higher grade computers can, and sometimes becomes annoying. but the game is worth the purchase just for the campain.",1
"good simulator game. love the detail,plus all the vehicles in the game. recommend this game to military sim players.",1
"the multiplayer in this game is amazing you can do almost anything. could use a bigger variety of guns.",2
"if your playing a dayz mod for this then you may as well call it a friendship breaker simulator 10/10 would betray friends again",3
"i have had endless hours of fun with this game it is absoulutely amazing, get the game!!!",4
"in 2 hours we bougth a car a boat managed to die 50 times drive my car into the sea then turn into a knagroo (somehow i managed to fly away with my char jumping like a kangoroo! thats what my friend told me after we played this game (altis mode)",1
"if you want to play a fps/tps game that will test your wits, this would be the game for you.",1
"very realistic, but doesnt run multiplayer at high frames.",1
"the next generation military simulator (or how bohemia call it: sandbox game). i love the details and features like weapons attachments and the new clothing system. also the new helicopter flight system is just brilliant. although i never played take on helicopters before. its just a awesome moment when flying a littlebird with the new flight system and transporting troops. cant wait for the helicopter dlc. thanks for that masterpiece bohemia interactive!",5
"its a must buy. love the graphics. love all the mods. i enjoy modding in this game, best game i like thats mod friendly. you must buy this game, you are missing out on all those cool multiplayer gamemodes like arma 3 life, wasteland, altis life, king of the hill, breaking point and epoch mod. buy now!",2
"great sandbox milsim. this game is not cod or bf4, it is a sim. if you take the time to learn all the controlls you will be rewarded with great gameplay.",3
"not recommended yet. as of jan/2014 bugs still exist in the game and the single-player campaign isnt finished. i bought it because i found it at 50% off and arma ii oa multi-player servers were fewer and fewer, except for day-z, but thats not my thing. what i dont like the most about arma iii is the small amount of content available (without mods) and its futuristic stance. its a matter of personal preference but i like to see vehicles and weapons that one can find in todays battlefields. and i really miss the taliban! graphics are quite good but performance in the game is a mixed experience, it can be ok for most of the game but then you get near an explosion and the whole thing slows to a crawl. my advice is: wait. even at 50% off. edit: after launch arma has been getting better and with some good and free updates. despite still missing some old content, im changing my recommendation to a buy discounted.",1
"great for people who like realism, lots of realism groups for you to join to do this on a large scale, it has a nice community and with the addition on zeus mode the game is pretty much an open sandbox world for mission creators to play with. would definately reccomend picking this up.",2
"save your money . and get arma 2 wayyyyyyyy better than this rushed junk . super terminator ai makes it impossible to play the game as intended . soldiers can see you under shrubs and trees from across the valley. ( with no binoculars). and the gun sway while aiming down sights is absolute garbage . feels like you already have p.t.s.d and you have not even played the game yet.and any soldier with parkinsons aiming skills after walking 10 meters should be shot anyway. i always come back to see if they have improved on anything . sadly they never patch the real issues . in the end nice to watch ......not to play. at least non modded anyway.",1
"good game, entertaining for hours :d still requires a lot of bug fixed though.",1
"banned for no reason and wont respond to my unban notice 10/10 would buy on my other account",2
"arma3 is a perfect military training software, infantry helmets,vests protective area and close to the real level of protection, the picture quality is the killer hardware level,arma3 provide simulation training for military infantry skills training, i love arma3. -kerry yang",2
"arma 3 is so much more than you expect. the amount of free content for this game is staggering.",1
"i love this game. there is so much you can do with it considering how flexible the simulation is. bullet physics are realistic and it is really satisfying when you get that kill. i highly reccomend it if you have friends to play with or are looking for a large amount of teamwork, because this game is great for that. now i just need someone to play with..",1
"i love arma 3 ....and the game is amazing... but isnt it time for the bugs to get fixed ? i am tired of dying when going down the stairs...getting stuck next to rocks, getting stuck inside of rocks.... not being able to sit/lay down on a big *** flat hills/boulders .... release date: 12 sep, 2013 .... its almost 2015 ...",2
"i got a helicopter, crashed it into the middle of a group of enemies and killed them all. 10/10 would jihad again.",3
"great game for anybody sick of the run and gun play style of cod, battlefield, and so on. the editor is fun and easy to understand, the multiplayer is a bit laggy, but other than that, perfect. the community in arma is the best i have seen in any game, and i think you should join it.",2
"car physics, fatigue is pretty dumb. good looking , runs",1
"possibly the most realistic military game with extreme replayablility. i dont regret a single cent i spent on this game, worth everything i payed for it and more!",2
"this game suffers of many glitches such as the stairs and ladders but it also suffers of epic lag proportions but it still a great game. totally worth it!!!!!!!!!",1
"very good game bt there is so much glitches that need to be fixed but great game. recommend this game to people who are patient it is alot of traveling. i have enjoyed it since having it.",2
"top graphics (high range pc recommended), check! community & mods, check! realism & complex game mechanics, check! i got this pre-alpha for a very very nice price. would buy again.",1
"the game was at times better than the second part, but there were still some bugs and not dachety. but the game is still very cool))",2
"i love this game so much i have so manny hours on it, sutch a good game, 10/10 would recomend.",1
"like all armas this is a sim not a fps. pros; sim with lots of mods cons; the mods are really the game. its solo mode is really bad, even compared to other armas very glitchy, very glitchy the price is twice what it should be. dlc price is twice what it should be. you need to have a tv and cable. when playing any of the mods you will spend hours running long distances in real time. so hulu is a must. overall; once its under $25s with dlc it will be worth the cash. but att it is way over priced. and when playing, be prepared to deal with a lot of haters until you find a good server with players who fit your style. dont give up, it can be alot of fun.",1
"because sometimes you just feel like going full operator.",4
"one word can describe this game: awesome. arma 3 is a realistic military sim. even with that in mind, for those who dont enjoy the realism, this game is one of the best fps ever created and offers something for everyone. map sizes are ridiculous, think of an average gta iv map, times that by ten. vehicle mechanics are greatly improved over arma ii, which makes them fun to drive, and gives you another sense of immersion. when your driving an armored vehicle, you actually feel empowered. as for weapons, the quality of the models, and the sound bytes are amazing. its not like your average fps....with headphones, every weapon sounds exactly like it would in real life, not some pew pew sound. i would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a boredom cure, with community made mods and game types, there is something in it for everyone.",1
"i recommend arma 3 because of all the weapons vehicles open world battles which will run smoothly on most computers i never thought a mass open world intense graphic military game would run so greatly on my pc. many servers to choose from allows so many players to join, in all an amazing game which will keep you busy and having fun. spot on 5 out of 5",1
"i like the way that the squad actually isuue orders unlike any other war games i have played",1
"very strategic and requires skill more than anything.",2
"just look at the trailers and demonstrations and u can see how awesome this game is.and that it never left alpha stage",5
"oh dlc, meh, not a big deal, i can probably take the weapons off dead bodies or maybe use them for a while as a trial. *gets in game* sweet, killed a guy, better snatch his sniper rif-. *purchase dlc now to use this weapon!* *uninstalls game* this is what i get for supporting these guys for years. way to go...",1
"...and i thought arma ii was good but this, now this is just amazing, this is what gaming is about. why are you reading this? go buy!",1
"arma 3 is one of the best simulators ever. better than gta and minecraft. the game has amazing textures and is extremly good. favourtie gamemode is invade and annex",2
"do not buy this   game bad quality crashed every 2 minutes and just not worth it man waste of ing money !!",1
"arma 3 packs a full punch, improving on all aspects of arma 2. from the weapon system, the flow of your character, or even the smallest thing such as your side mirrors and rear view mirrors in your car actually work. pick this game up. you will not be disappointed.",1
"best game ever i love the series and hope there will be an arma 4",1
"one of the best simulation game great ambient so immersive & the other mod just special i recomanded battle royal , you need absolutly try this mod incredible experiences..",1
"arma 3 is a great military simulator which allows you to explore a very large map called altis and a smaller map called stratis with other players which leaves you fighting off the enemys who have control of the island. just recently bohemia servers have shut down due to steam buying out the bohemia and for some unknown reason, we arma 3 fans are still waiting for the servers to go online. it has been almost 3 months now and still no sign of the servers. this game is best when you are able to play with friends as i dont reccomend purchasing this game until bohemia interactive and steam sort out the server issues. unfortunately, arma 3 is going to be sitting in my steam library gathering cobwebs until the servers are back online.",1
"arma 3 hates me. (steam free) every server i join it says there is a battleeye error and kicks me, after getting back to the lobby menu arma 3 crashes. this sucks, pretty pointless. every other game that uses battle eye has no problem with me.",1
"as a huge fan of arma 2, i really wanted to like this game. i knew it would have a rocky release, but its been over a year now, and this game still feels incomplete. of course its poorly optimized, has sli issues (my pip wont even work with sli), and is very cpu-intensive, but thats only the beginning of my frustration with this game. issues from arma 2, like the horrid vehicle physics, are still prevalent in this game as far as i can tell from having my apc rolled over by a pickup truck. the fatigue and weapon sway debate aside, this game still clearly has problems and is hardly a finished product *ahem $16 dlc that includes just 2 helicopters*. at this point, ive just given up on bis, and dont see them fixing this game any time soon. that being said, i have had enjoyable moments with this game, but just not enough to compensate for the amount of technical issues the game has. tl;dr: would not recommend to a fan of previous arma games, or anyone for that matter.",2
"love this game so much,but you will need a goog computer",2
"this game is a lot of fun to play with a friend. especially altis life, and wasteland. i had just spawned in on wasteland and there was this guy so i shot him and he apparently had a helicopter with him so i took it and flew off. while i was flying around in a blackhawk heli. a jet comes and starts swarming me and trying to kill me so i land the heli somewhere almost explode cuz of mah mad skillz. and got in a car and was sniped out from the back of the car and died from a guy named jake from 3000 meters off into the distance. and rage moded for an hour. cuz im pro. get this game. it is a heck of a lot of fun.",1
"ive had arma 3 for a while now, and id have to say it is my favorite military game of all time. of course it has its glitches and lack of vehicles and weapons, but those can all be fixed by the community. there are so many memorable situations that you can get yourself into. for example, i was recently playing some arma 3 wasteland and about a minute after i spawned in, i ran into 3 enemies. at first i thought there was only one so i took him out with a few rounds from an assault rifle i had just found in a nearby building. i heard him yelling over the mic during the last few seconds of his life theres a guy here trying to kill me, you guys need to get over here! so after i stole his hard-earned money from his corpse, i layed in some nearby bushes waiting to pounce on his incoming friends. when they arrived i managed to take out one before my rifle ran dry and i was left to the mercy of the remaining twos machine guns. moments like these are what make playing arma 3 a truly unique experience. i highly recommend the game.",3
"it doesnt get any better than this, poss the greatest military shooter of all time, and one of the most diverse mod comminity out there... 11 out of 10",1
"in my opinion the second game is much more fun. i dont really like the setting, and the game is just not arma. this game is more like arma: tactical roleplay altis life.",1
"so real, so customizable, could really do with more guns in the default game itself though.",1
"get it and play it enjoy it. it is alpha and it will have annoying bug or something weird.",2
"not you daily average fast paced combat. most people says it is a military simulation and somehow i agree. smart devs, if you are bored you can try the virtual arsenal or the military fashion or maybe create missions in the editor where you just actually spawn random things. and its modable, too bad theres little in the workshop than armaholic. personally i like it, doesnt require high specs and its really breathtaking. campaign, multiplayer, showcases, custom made campaigns and many more. you dont have to be arma 2 veteran to play it. because this game is for everyone for those who wants to migrate from fast paced combat to military simulation.",2
"arma3, contains many near future weapons and vehicles, provids us with future-combat experience. unfortunately, i dont like so much such kind of things as the experience of arma2. but, i think arma3 is still very valuable and enjoyable, for its highly improved graphics, sound, effects and controlabily make arma3 worth authentically.",1
"still getting black screen on a quad core with dual cards that runs bf4 and arma 3 in ultra with no issues. awesome job, really.",1
"excellent game, 10/10- excellent graphics and gameplay if you get this you must try altis life and king of the hill they are both excellent gamemodes and you get alot of action from them, would recommend this game to anyone",1
"the best war sim out, great graphics, grab it on sale and you wont regret it.",1
"though not as realistic as its predecessors, arma 3 is still fun and has good replayability with zeus and the mods out there. a big part of this game is multiplayer though, so i wouldnt buy this (except for if its on sale) unless you have that option.",2
"beautiful, just beautiful. if youre thinking about getting this game, dont think about it just get it! so much stuff to do and you will have fun!",2
"great game with great potentional with the modding community. arma 3 engine in itself is an amazing engine with plenty of scripting opportunities for new developers and experienced ones. without the modding community i dont think this game would be as popular as it is, but with the modding community its amazing what they bring to the table in this open world military simulator. between altis life (best described as grand theft auto where humans play every role), to wasteland, and even ahoyworlds co-op capture gameplay, this game has definitive replayability. i really love the dayz epoch mod, and breaking point mod as they both bring their own taste of the post-apocalyptic mayhem to the arma 3 community. now i cant wait for the helicopter dlc and the markman dlc coming soon. realism in flying helicopters and additional mid to long range weapons will just be icing on the cake for this series, and the cake isnt a lie with this one.",4
"i played it sometime... just a little... its great i guess... to be more precise the game is an awesome game for you and your friends. theres alot of servers just for you.. if its a zombie game your looking for? join epoch or some other mod about zombies. if its a realistic team playing server? go ahead join one of the great communities out there if you just want to kick some  online? join king of the hill and the game is even moddable theres 100s of possibilities theres alot of opportunities i reccomend this game for the guys who likes the realistic, team play and maybe guys who like competetive",4
"recomed for simulator players it really enjoyable but 1 of the probloms is the fps about but overall that a like the game and the stuff you can do on it and it recomed for simulator player",1
"best modern war simulation in my opinion, tons of gamemodes to choose from. you dont need a 2000$ pc to run it play with your friends, alone or with strangers youll always have a blast playing this game!",1
"a great military simulation, but the mods are what make the game, with battle royale and altis life offering really unique gameplay experiences.",1
"takes some practice to be good at this, and a lot more practice to work tactically as a team, but nothing is more rewarding than moving fluidly as a unit and getting things done without losing a single teammate. once you get the tactics down you will then be able to fully enjoy this game. 8/10",1
"if youre like myself and enjoy a fully immersive and realistic experience in a fps, then youll enjoy arma 3. also, while youre at it, try it with the playerunknowns battle royale mod for true heart palpitating intensity!",1
"i love this game only bad thing is that its so addictive xd this game is so much fun to play with friends. none of my friends wanted to buy it at first once they saw a few videos they fell in love now they play even more than me xd",3
"yes, yes, yes....... great game to play with your friends. it has a lot of variation.",2
"first day in altis was taken hostage by rebels and hurled out of a moving helicopter before being mugged for my car and being thrown in prison as a consequence. 10/10. would holiday in altis again.",1
"move the game, very good detail and im in the military and can say its extremely close. wish we had some of the older weapons still like the aks and m16 and othe guns because i bet people will still be using those 30 years from now. but over all it is an amazing game and hope that can keep improving to wow me.",2
"i luv this game it has amazing graphics but there is one problem with playing! that is you need a group of freinds",1
"i have only played it for the weekend, but man do i love it. despite the minor few glitches its great, and man did it make you have to pay attention to your surroundings.",1
"010 buy if you wanna get bullied 247 by jews, swedish autists, british balloon poppers, fedora users and edgy shitposters",5
"feels like i wasted my money. game looks beautiful, but it got too frustrating when it felt like everyone else was going on with the mission and combat, and i was left looking around for the enemy. outisde of waiting for some tracers to show up and give the enemy away, my efforts to eliminate my target were futile 99% of the time. id use up all my ammunition, and theyd land in a perfect shot, every single time. it got to the point that i would end up sitting back while the ai on my team took care of it- after all, they knew exactly what to do while im just sitting there shrugging my shoulders. this is not your typical combat fps. the controle are wonky, and i spent a hard-earned $60 on frustration. i have a titan video card. it runs all of my games on maximum settings flawlessly. with arma 3, it seems like all i do to ajust the graphics settings makes no difference, as im hit with major framerate issues. after a few days, i reinstalled the game to give it another chance, but i just couldnt get anything accomplished. i personally dont recommend the game.",1
"dont buy this game in its current state. its worse than playing with a melted gi. joe",1
"if youve got a fetish for first person shooters and the military and happen to be rejected by a real life military branch or happen to be a mechanic or cook in the military then this game is for you. other than that, move along in your real life and join the military. if you cant and happen to be in a wheel chair and love the military then buy this game and dream.",1
"this game is epic battleground. worth to buy and play. so many different maps and mods.",2
"this game is amazing. i know that it is by no means finished, but at least bis has been giving us updates on its progress fairly often. if you get the right mods right now, such as voice activated commands and tmr, this game can be insanely fun today! hopefully bis will get around to getting some of these great mods implemented into the vanilla arma 3, but until then the modding community has us covered. i would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in some tactical, realistic, teamwork oriented, and some crazy fun gameplay.",2
"i wish i had the money to buy this game :( its so fun!",1
"been playing arma for 3 years now, ruined my life ex: oh hey look dragon age just came out *buys and starts playing* *2 hours later get message from friend* arma? *never touch dragon age again 10/10",1
"game is good. remove kebab from desk instead of lug large weight of pack across battlefield. reminds me of chechen conflict of 1999. overall good game 10/10 ivan approve!",1
"great game for hardcore gamers cant wait for what more is to come in this game",1
"honestly this game is amazing. once you learn the controls and get a feel of waht arma 3 is about you will never wanna stop playing it. you just simply cant get bored of arma 3! there are so many mods and gamemodes to choose from!! i must say, excellent job bohemia interactive!!!",2
"every other war game seems rubbish comparing to arma iii",1
"this is, hands down, the best military simulator available. there is a steep learning curve and its not very plug and play, but a3 can deliver an incredibly rewarding experience if authenticity and realism are up your alley. the arma series has proven to be both a fun combined arms shooter as well as an invaluable training tool.",1
"this is an awesome game, totally reccomend it for everyone. so many mods, so much to do.",1
"best army sim on the market. price may be a little big, but i dont regret it. 9 out of 10 highly recommend",1
"awsome game pritty nice grapics ran on full blast fps around 30 but will need a beafy computer to run it on full grapic but i really wish they could combine all arma 2 oa weapons and vehicles into this game and then it would be the best arma to me.",3
"great game, love almost everthing about it. i love teh movements, and the weapons, flying being easier and somehow more enjoyable, the great and beautiful environment, and much much more. the thing i dont like about the game, is that the updates dont really update our games... the updates make multiplayer server searching have issues searching and take about 1 hour to load the entire server list, loading one server every 10-15 seconds. you also get glitches when you host a server where you select a mission, but the teams, player slots, and the player list are all bugged out and cant see them. hope this issue gets fixed, then it would be my best chosen advanced military simulator.",1
"game is good. graphics are good. the mods are good. what else could you need?",1
"shot a surfer in the genitals point blank and he died 10/10",1
"amazing , perfect game , also a great investment .",1
"better than battlefield 4 and every other fps combined times 2",1
"note: you cant run this game on a potato. youre gonna want 40 fps to play comfortably i shouldnt have bought this game for another year.",1
"the game is good. have many thing to do. but now game still lack of the mod i love the most since arma one is warfare mode. which is basebuilld around you to buy unit and explore the map and conquest the town i didnt said game was bad. im still that there will be official release for the warfare mode. the single player is ok for me. but the setting is not i love modern weapon which current in use like in arma 2 more than those prototye weapon. so this arma is still recommend if you want the simulator game that not hard. i love to drive tank and play infantry in this game , but fly model isnt that good so i didnt fly much but it easy enough to fly anyway and if you have friend to play with it awesome as developer including zues mode !!! if you dont want to play with mod this game dont have much thing like arma2 so wait more a bit i believe developer will release more content !!",1
"the game was great and i really recommend others getting. i know i will be getting it",1
"everyone who plays arma 3 online used to be a u.s. marine. fact.",2
"i owned the game but now i have to buy it again??!!! this is stupid give me my game or money back!!!!!",1
"great game. keep up the good work.strong community",2
"arma 3 is a great game,if you kown how to enjoy it",1
"so far arma 3 has been worth every penny spent. even though the gameplay is simmilar to arma 2 its has its perks. i am now part of a great arma community and love play with fellow team mates that love the games as much as i do. if your intersted in military sim and not cod then this game should not be lacking in your library,",1
"arma 3. what can you say game of the yeah. the gameplay is just so cool and stuff i can only say yes to this game.",3
"like the boss once told me: what about you, jack? whats it going to be? loyalty to your country, or loyalty to me? your country, or your old mentor? the mission, or your beliefs? your duty to your unit, or your personal feelings? you dont know the truth yet. but sooner or later youll have to choose. in choosing my country over my old mentor, and having to kill her... i choose to not fight for any flags, i choose not to kill for the sake freedom. there is no freedom, in this day and age, there is no peace; freedom and peace are all lies conjured up by the warlocks of the goverment, the heads of states... war... war has changed and so has our methods. join us, join the diamond dogs. let us beride of these liars, these cheap salesmen, let us change the world; one goverment at a time. let opperation altis & stratis begin.",1
"the negative reviews for this game, are cod fan boys, and people with no patience. this game is awesome. sure, its a total  on your pc, but still, its the funnest game out there. i had bought arma 2 just to play dayz, i then found myself playing arma 2 and arma 2 oa more than i did dayz. i then looked at arma 3 on the store, smiled and tried to play it. couldnt even play on normal settings, so i immediately stuffed 500 dollars down my computers throat and then tried again. the graphics are beautiful, and the game play is even greater. i remember one time i went on stratis life, a fan made game mode where you can be a drug dealer, police officer, or just the average hard worker. i met my bff on there, and we put our money together to buy a chopper. we then started picking and selling drugs, running from the cops, and so much more! do you want a giant battle with a 100+ people with tanks, helicopters and planes? this game is for you! want to join a realism unit with other people, and get the real military feel?! this game is for you!!!!!",2
"buy it! seriously if you already havnt do it now!",2
"the arsenal has made the game better by letting you import your own loadouts through zeus",1
"very good its worth the price tag but make sure you have an amazing computer or you will be getting about 7 fps :p",2
"if you like realistic army games, this game is for you!",1
"this is just to recommend others like me... this is in no way saying the game is horrible. i understand its not a casual shooter, but coming from battlefield to play this? i know what people may say about my review of the game, but holy ... movement mechanics by far are too complex... i typically expect to use only the minimum amount of keys to perform movements, but what the ... i am not going to count the plethera of those required to perform different movements, but its some kind of high  number. i played the campaign as far as i could take and halted completely when it came to flying the uav... i took me about 10 tries until i gave up and shouted obsenities at my tv... every time i tried i flew it into a rock, a house, myself, and even into the ocean... tldr: i dont have the patience to play this, nor the appetite to constantly learn how to bind keys. if you are a casual shooter kind of person stay the  away from this. trust me... im pretty good at battlefield, but just terrible at this. (two different games completely) i guess thats what makes this game unique. pros? its pretty beautiful though...",1
"a mostly incomplete yet incredibly addictive and detailed sandbox that takes playing army to an entirely new level.",4
"great shooter simulator! singleplayer might be boring for some people, but the online experience with a great community will give you a great time.",3
"64 players on over 290 km. this game is a virtual marathon simulator.",1
"this is the best modern military shooter out that if you want it to be, or it can be a boring walking simulator with no real purpose. but you will only get the second option if you are uncooperative, or a console peasant who doesnt appreciate how to work in a team or fill a role. well that only applies to the multiplayer, but that is the best feature of this game. the multiplayer requires great communication and a willing to work, but your reward for that is the best team based multiplayer since the 90s, although not for the same reasons. the campaign is also very good, easily better than call of duty and battlefield and the level editor is very in depth, and the graphics are insane.",1
"you really need to play this to realise what a skillbased shooter is all about. and its fun to boot!",1
"this is a great military sim and is best when playing on the ghost gaming community altis life server!",5
"i found this game swagadelic and extremely competitive! would highly recommend.",3
"fun game when you have a group going. i would definitely suggest checking out the workshop as there are some quality missions for team play.",1
"great game with great potentional with the modding community. arma 3 engine in itself is an amazing engine with plenty of scripting opportunities for new developers and experienced ones. without the modding community i dont think this game would be as popular as it is, but with the modding community its amazing what they bring to the table in this open world military simulator. between altis life (best described as grand theft auto where humans play every role), to wasteland, and even ahoyworlds co-op capture gameplay, this game has definitive replayability. i really love the dayz epoch mod, and breaking point mod as they both bring their own taste of the post-apocalyptic mayhem to the arma 3 community. now i cant wait for the helicopter dlc and the markman dlc coming soon. realism in flying helicopters and additional mid to long range weapons will just be icing on the cake for this series, and the cake isnt a lie with this one.",4
"good, great potential but to expensive for what you get atm.",1
"terribly optimized and leaves you wondering what the difference is between this and arma 2. the entire arma series needs an overhaul. the only keeping these games alive are player made mods. wish novalogic still made games.",1
"if you like shooting things this is the game for you",2
"arma 3 was a good game but i have played it for 125 hours and i fined it boring and repetive. but i only ever played the rpg the story might have been good i do not know. my frend saids mod it but no thats why i got arma 2 dayz (mod). but i just want to play mt new games like payday 2. but my frends just want to play arma 3. 6/10 ( this game can be good but do not play to much.)",1
"best military sim franchise out there its a must have for pc gamers even if it is a bit buggy",3
"this is the best shooting simulator ever made i think this is real life s*** i going to the army in the future so i highly recommand you download this game if your going to the army in the future like me.",2
"still some of the most bug infested games ive seen. texture and ground control is a joke, turn around to fast in a building and you might get killed. hide behind a rock? bad idea, as rocks have a tendancy to swollow you whole and spit you out somewere else to fall to your death. its a little strange really, seing that these things worked stably in games developed over two decades ago, like doom and wolfenstein 3d. is arma 3 still in early alpha?",3
"arma 3 is an awesome game , if you like roleplaying war , life , or anything like that or if you just wana run around killing people an blowing  up theres that to . its good fun for everyone an i can play for hours i dont have much time to play atm cause of school but when im on break ill be playing it ... dlc for it was never my thing to buy cause it is over pice , arma 3 an has alot of mods tho so know worrying on not having anything to do would buy it if have the money , i had it since day one",1
"very realistic, but still playable as a not full pro in balistic and stuff :d",1
"arma2 with some new weapon stances, granade shortcut keys and zeus live mission mode. definately worth getting with discount - would not recommend paying full price if u got arma ii already.",1
"if you enjoy military simulators or survival games, this is the game to get, the modding for it is slowly picking up and will only make the game better as the years go on.",1
"do you find yourself angry at the cod or battlefield for being horrible unrealistic? if you this is the game for you, guns, tanks, planes, boats. what more is there to say?",1
"i love this game! but they should make a free version! or make a weekend when u get the game for free for ever! cuz 66$ is a lot of money! awesome game though... played it for two days",1
"arma 3 has made me hate every other fps, because in arma you have the freedom to do what ever you want. the games modding community is great, which keeps the game interesting with new maps, guns, vehicles, etc. the game is not that well optimised but it performs well enough and looks great. there is a lot of great gamemodes that get overshadowed by wasteland and altis life gamemodes. one great example is teetimes captrure the island gamemode. the zeus dlc is a great tool to make cool missions on the fly and the great thing about is that you dont need a dedicated community for it, you can just jump on a public game and have fun. arma has incredibly detailed mission editor in which you can spend tons of time just exploring the map, blowing up some ai, learning to fly a helicopter, and so on. if you like shootters and would like to play something more realistic get arma 3.",2
"arma 3 a game you will not get bored off, i played this game for over 600 hours and its still not boring, and the modding system is extreme. there are millions of mods for this game and that increases the play time and fun. if u have a choice buy arma 3 and arma 2 both are good games.",4
"43 hours of getting to the battlefield and 1 hour of getting shot and dying, great military sim.",1
"game is really fun. its not some game like cod where you can run and gun. no this game needs tactics and good team communication. the graphics are also amazing 9999/10 - ign",1
"a very fun modern war game! i also really like the mods for the gam.",1
"very fun played it for hours. i dont like the lack of content compared to arma 2. they dont seem to be adding more content but selling more content? it is very bothersome to me, but the game itself is good enough.",3
"this is an excellent military simulation game that the military bases their own simulator off of. this game is hands down the best fps i have played.",1
"this is the most realistic you will ever get in a military simulator. i have over 50 hours on it and have never been so amazed by the content it has to offer. not only do you have all this great stuff as in, sniping, cqb, tanks and vechical combat, but there is an editor for testing and making missions scenarios. there has also been a new bootcamp update added in that lets mods and more expirenced builders (of missions) expand their ability to create missions.",3
"a more realistic battlefield/cod when you play modes like wasteland or king of the hill; can also be fun if you play the dayz mod for free; battle royal, do i need to say more? get dropped on an island with 30 other people, find a weapon and survival of the fittest!; if youre the roleplaying person, who likes to deal drugs, have s (women, who sell their bodies to greasy guys) or just be a corrupt cop, then altis life is just the right thing for you! so in general, this game offers are great variety of mods, its very own realism and its not full of garbage kiddies, who flame and pretend to have made love with your mother (like the cod-fanboys, lel) 10/10 would buy again",2
"its quite a bare game for the price. but luckily theres tonnes of high quality addons out thare to make this game legendary. the campaign was tough... but unpredictable and awesome. the dlc is overpriced for what you get. and the editor is just as awesome as previous armas. 8.5/10... would arma again.",1
"fantastic gameplay multiple gamemodes to which you can edit them to your liking and personal interest..... great player base too",2
"would suck  for this game, 10/10, (but seriously, someone gimme game plz im in severe arma withdraw.)",1
"hit a snake at slow speed my car when supersonic this is a hardcore simulator",3
"arma 3 is a nice improvement from arma 2 however it can still be improved on, regardless of that its well rounded and nicely polished for what its worth, you can get hours of fun online in multiple game modes or you can play a nice military simulator campaign, there is also the editor which you can mess about with and create your own user made missions and just have pure fun in.",1
"stole someones atv while he looted a body, and then ran on him and killed him. (battle royale) this game is awesome, it has an amazing single player (tough to beat), so much mods to play which is really really fun! like breaking point, wasteland, altis life or battle royale, though there will be bugs/errors, but just google it and solve it, its easy. i would defently recommend to buy this amazing game. 24/7 would play.",1
"great game, still new to it, and enjoy it so far. has bugs in it like all the other arma games out there.",1
"why cant i run this ever time i click on the arma 3 short cut it brings me here",1
"if you have a high end gaming pc and you are interested in heavy military simulators definitly get this game. its the few of its kind with that much detail and that level of simulation. its a really fun game.",1
"this is an awsome game love it love batlle royale and altis life",1
"found a chance to try rp. bought a car and equipment before a crew bumped to my car. they stole my equipments and my clothes also my car. ive said them i need to find my kid. they said we will help. they took me a place where they stole your kidney. they stole my kidney and literally gave it to my hand. then they took it back and put a bullet in my head. 10/10 would take my kidney on my hand again.",1
"this game is a simulation and it takes alot of tatics to play so if you like tactics and realistic games then this game is for you",2
"the closest you can get to actually flying a helicopter, driving a tank and shooting a gun without actually touching any of them.",1
"its the best, way better than arma 2, way better than i expected it. i highly recomend this to those who play arma 2, or those who like combat games with huge free roam maps and tons of addons. 11/10",1
"this game could be the best of the year if the optimization didnt completely break the game",1
"as you would expect,an amazing combat sim with lots of military toys to play with.",1
"play this game for atlis and epoch. you will love it.",1
"can we just take 3 minutes to appreciate this game...? thank you.",2
"inconsistent fps from 25 to 19 up to 45fps with an r9 280x 8gigs of ram on low med settings its just junk. 4/10",1
"graphics are great. realistic. now i just need all of my friends to buy it!!",1
"this is a great strategical military sandbox game its such a cool but  dont like the mod types like survive so we also need a zombie sandbox gamemod like dayz epoch,we dont even have a mod like that that game is great for the altis life players so the only great thing of this game is altis life its the best rp mod  have ever seen so ppllzzz, bohemia interactive add thing like dayz standalone or just add a expansion like the arma 2 operation arrowhead.",1
"a masterpiece. with the infinite amount of content, amazing textures and deteals, huge map, fun dlcs, and amazing controls, this game is one of the if not the best games on the market to this date. ive put 72 hours roughly into this game and it still keeps bringing me back for more. between altis life, wasteland, amazing workshop content, and dlcs/campaign there is no stop to the endless things this game has to offer. the team based strategies of wasteland multiplayer are amazing. you find awesome people in team speak and after the server i always find myself adding more and more people to my friends list. with the excitement of finding enemy weapon crate stashes, abandoned helicopters and tanks, a huge fight between opfor and blufor teams, and if your lucky a jet is something that always makes me want to play wasteland 24/7. if you are reading this review and are deciding on wether to buy this game or not, there are many things to take into acount. this game will not be very much fun with a bad/mediocre computer. although the computing power demands of this game are high please buy this game and you will find how fun and exciting everything about this game is. thanks for reading.",1
"ive only played this in wasteland but i would say it is amazing.",1
"this game is stupid when i launch it it says invalid depot config help steam!!!!!!!!",1
"arma 3 is one of the worst games i have ever played and i have no idea how people play the game, the controls are confusing and completely ridiculous, you set the game to the lowest difficulty and still die by a single shot. and if you happen to press a certain button (still no clue which button that is.) your game completely freezes on itself and only allows you to move and look around.",1
"a virtual battlefield and simulation experience like no other since 2001 (op. flashpoint). and series, as arma, continues to evolve with this great, yet not perfect, title. enough said.",5
"game is an unrefined piece of poop in the engine then again its an unrefined piece of poop engine that allows you to use every vehicle and weapon you see in every tactic and combination you can imagine, and has the moddability to make everything from a zombie apocalypse to the water temple.",1
"great game. lots of popular mods, great modding community, will be around for a long time.",1
"this is a very good game that is worth what i paid for it.",1
"spawned as a bunny in kavala, runned all the way up to sofia. best bunny simulator 11/10",4
"arma 3 is a very realistic combat simulator. if you are looking for a game with a fast paced shooter and can take a few rounds whilst sprinting this is not the type for you. due to it being a simulator the pace is much slower and you should be much more tactical in your approach. the game looks amazing and the story line has not a heap of jam packed content but the available content is really good. as a simulator is still gives you many of hours of fun! the available units and arsenal are realistic as it gets. this game is not for the faint hearted, it takes some serious gettting used to but it worth every moment, as it states it truly is a simulator. the multiplayer scenarios are also good, many new updates and patches are quick to fix, with pvp wastleland and an rpg angle to the game also available. only thing i have as a con (is from personal choice) is there is no longer any servers playing co-op operations at this time.",1
"the best arma of the collection. the graphics are stunning and the gameplay is fantastic.",1
"great simulation mechanics and awesome graphics fidelity.",1
"this game looks great and runs great on singleplayer but for some reason on multiplayer servers, fps drops to like 20??? its only a multiplayer thing.",1
"this game is just amazing and just addicting the altis life makes it evern more fun with friends and a great community",4
"its amazing, you can add things to the game, better graphics, better driving and better hit shooting",1
"i like this game, it is mostly realistic, no bullcrap, and well set up. because it is a realistic shooter, it can sometimes get boring, but its worth it. i recommend buying this",2
"you will die from anything. cars have no physics. they make no sense. best sandbox game of 2013. 8/10",1
"if you are into military scenarios, this game is great for you. with the new engine and actual physics aspects, it takes a big leap forward for the arma series. for me, it has been an amazing trip from alpha into the upcoming release, an was not in any way a dissapointment. i cant wait for jets :d",1
"i got arrested because matt drove into the police car. 69/10",2
"realy nice game... a few bad hacks and buggs still out for it but over all very good game",5
"its not a bad game but i highly recomend you spend that dirty nearly 40 on something else, like the new wolfenstein game or treat your girlfriend to a nice dinner, or better yet, pay a hooker instead. best bet is a bunch of 10-15 games with sould and character like s.t.a.l.k.e.r or something like that.",1
"exceptional game. not your typical shooter. the main campaign is long and immersive with twists and turns that i would have never expected. this game makes it impossible to rush directly into battle, spray and pray, and come out alive. you have to be calculative and tactical with your decisions and movements, or someone is surely going to die. unlike in other shooters, the ai adapts to the changing environment around them and is truly a challenge to take on in even a small firefight. 10/10 highly recommend.",2
"this game is so much fun! the multiplayer has such an active modding community that there is always something new to try! i have spent countless hours playing the arma series in general, well done bohemia! 10/10",2
"lots of fun! different gamemodes, lots of sandbox elements and great realism and graphics!",1
"arma 3 is great!!!! let me just start by saying are you sick of the troll kiddies running around with the cheapest weapons and using an auto aim assist and killing you right away? i know i am. this game gives you an immense feel for war and keeps you thinking constantly. sometimes the action is spaced out quiet a bit but when the battle hits it is the gaming moments that stay with you forever. plus getting that mega kill is something to actually be proud of with your skill and not just stupid luck.",1
"the game is great! it is a very realistic war simulator that i highly recommend. it makes call of duty look like dog poop. there are a lot of mods that are fun to play. you can do just about anything in this game, fly helos, drive quads, trucks, tanks, shoot people, and much more. it just makes me mad that i bought it for $59.99 three days ago and today it is on sale for $29.99. 11/10 would pay full price again.",1
"so i downloaded the dlc bundle for arma 3 and i try enabling it and i restart it and then i get back on and its not there ive tried verifying cache",3
"this was my first arma game and it was amazing the controls are not hard but not the easiest this game is probly te best game i have ever played in gameplay but..... now it crashes to the point i cant play any multiplayer but other than that its amazing i think anyone who likes shooters and roleplay games should buy and play this game at least try it sometime",3
"i dont own the game but somehow i can write a review.... so i wrote one!",1
"much wow, much fun. went diving, found a ai patrol, threw a nade, and killed myself.",1
"this game is amazing i have seen gamplay i would recemend it to eny one that likes war games. this game is nice to play with friends. if i could get the money i would buy this but i dont have eny :( sadly",1
"of all hardware intensive games we have, arma 3 has the best muiltiplayer. when we arent lagging around the map, pretending to be wizards, we are experiencing the wonderous 15 fps, which makes it more cinematic, especially when you are using textures that look like they were professionally spray painted in ms.paint. 11/10 would play again!",1
"do not buy this game. its a colossal waste of money. instead of paying bohemia interactive for their failing, they should pay you for all the pain and suffering while playing this game.",1
"it aint cod. it aint bf. its arma. and its freaking awesome.",1
"battle eye is so ing stupid got a global ban for logging on to a server",1
"awesome tactical gameplay, if you enjoy simulations, this is not cod or bf4!!!!",5
"just yes! if you loved arma 2 youre going to love this!",1
"it must be said again and again: the arma series is not compareable to any cinematic driven, action packed shooters! and if you dont like teambased multiplayer, you wont get too much fun out of it, since the singleplayer campaign seems to be more like an extra. this said, the third armed assault gives you everything you need for the most realistic and intense battle experience possible! you might complain about the near future setting, which made it even harder for me to leave my beloved chernarus (arma 2) behind, but you wont stumble over pulse rifles et cetera. furthermore youll get a huge sandbox world, an editor to do in it whatever you want and a fine community that never sleeps! so, what else should i recommend right now? buy it! dont wait for more content and lower pricing, the war has already begun! edit: best game ever! =)",4
"one of the best shooters out there. on ultra graphics the game looks real. the combat is so open that it is diffrent every time. i put 12 hrs on this game the first day i got it. with so many game modes it never gets boring. 10/10",2
"i enjoy this for playing with my friends or just dicking around! picked it up when it was on sale for $36 and i would recommend that if you were to buy it you shold do the same.",1
"if you like to have a relastic first-person shooter, this is the game for you. with the posibilities to create your own missions or join thousands of other trough out the many servers there is. if the game dosent fit you the way it is, it has greate modding support. and there is alot of mods out there. and it just keep on growing in numbers each day. the game is set some years in the future, but is still a modern shooter. with different vehicles, from sea to air. you aproach your problems the way you want them to be solved.",3
"despite its futuristic setting arma 3 is still arma, and the improvements over the last installment are certainly welcome. in terms of optimization, physics, graphics, lighting, and ease of use through the steam workshop it is miles ahead of its predecessor. is it worth the $60 price tag? no. wait until it goes on sale. the longer you wait, the more complete the game will actually be. the developers are continually adding on to the features and campaign. if you didnt like previous installations of arma, you probably wont like this one either. for those like me who have been playing since ofp, youve probably already made up your mind about arma 3.",3
"don not buy this game unless!!!!! you want to vanish into your computer for hours on end ignoring you wife, friends, and family....... the standalone game is amazing alone and then you have the mods.... altis life is the most fun you can have in rp. you can be anything, cop, criminal, fisherman, dope dealer, anything! they keep making it better and better.",5
"pros - fun editor good multiplayer nice community good devs cons - fps lag if you dont have a amazing computer hard too solo - multiplayer over all 9/10",2
"it was a long road but now arma3 is a really good game with many gamemodes and options as arma2 was but it also has kept some of the old issues...but in my opinion it is a must have :d",2
"this is definately one of my favourite games at the moment. it is a game that requires a ton of patience though, so if you are used to call of duty, then this game is probably not for you.",1
"love this game! tons of mods, infinite gameing experience",2
"this game is really good. i would give it a 9/10 and the reason i give it such a high rating is because there are endless things to do. such as altis life or maybe tactical missions but my favorite part of the game is flying. there is the standard flying which is sorta like a arcade flying but still has some realistic features then there is advanced flying. but besides that this game is just great before i had this game i was a lone wolf on arma 2 but on here i met a awesome group of people that i play arma 3 with every night we even have are own altis life server.",3
"trash game, bohemia fails to fix the lag issue, hotfixes making the lag even worse. the combat isnt realistic if you have 5 fps, bohemia fix this game before you make more games.",1
"ok, this game is a huge upgrade from arma 2, graphics were inhanced, gameplay was made better, when talking to teammates the guy doesnt sound like a robot anymore(especially when accouncing grid locations) and overall its just waaaaaaaay better . but, theres one thing that bothers me, the explosions. in arma 2 the explosions were majestic, they had vibrant colours and the colours were sharp. i used to place a tank and then make a jet destroy the tank just so i could see the explosion, or i would fly in a helicopter and shoot rockets, but in arma 3 the explosions look so unpowerful and the colour is dull, theres nothing going on, it doesnt feel or look like a real explosion(apart from the debris flying). arma 2s explosions looked alot better. that for me is the only down-side, the ai was also improved alot.",1
"nice game. great military-simulation. plenty of community made mods.",3
"this game is definitely a direct improvement over arma 2. if you are familiar with that game, it is very easy to transition over to this game. i especially enjoy the mission editor. the mission editor has a pretty steep learning curve, but enough tutorials and trial and error will get you competent with the editors logic. the game is much better optimized than arma 2 was, but it still runs pretty awful on multiplayer, even with a high spec pc. i ended up having to turn down my view distance to a pretty low amount to consistently get 40 fps on multiplayer, because the fps largely relies on the servers power. on single player or a small server of 5-10 people, i could just about max out the game with a steady 60 fps. i am disappointed with the dlc though, as it really doesnt add much at all to the game at this point, and it retails at $25. i would recommend picking this game up, even if you have never played the other arma games, because it seems like it has a much smaller learning curve than previous titles, but is still just as in-depth. this game is a good purchase, especially on sale, the dlc on the other hand is not currently worth it.",1
"arma 3 is great when it runs as intended, the problem is when it doesnt it becomes some what unplayable. ill keep playing it (as you can see in my hours played) becuase its the only game that does what it does.",3
"it might not be as good as arma 2 in my opinion but its still great!",1
"the downside to this game, only one, you gotta play a lot, to get very good at it. is that a downside?",2
"i recommend this game, it is really fun! pros: -stunning graphics -great story and scenarios -multiplayer, should i say more? cons: -multiplayer: to join a friend in a server takes too much time. but thats the only con we have",1
"the game is a beautiful piece of art many times the size of the skyrim province. arma 3 has a few genres incorporated for our entertainmentbut the two main are military simulator and flight simulator, personally, since finishing the campaign i have been playing the dead nation mod and im totally immersed. more so than skyrim. more so than any game ive played. its worth its money and even better if you get it when its on sale. if you cant wait then look around for a cheaper new sealed hard copy on amazon. its hard to be good at this game so bad losers beware :-)",2
"nice looking game but lets be honest multiplayer frame rates are a serious issue . minium requirments are a farse",1
"arma 3 is a good successor to arma2 with some great improvements to the engine, visuals, vehicles etc. mainly i have played the wasteland, king of the hill and epoch (alpha) mods. king of the hill being the most rewarding and enjoyable over all. i have only just dipped my toes into the campaign, however i will be doing more of it i think. with all the improvements to arma, youll still get those good ole arma moments like clipping through walls/floors, and your vehicle exploding on contact with a weed or bush.",5
"it is an amazing game with alot adventures and amazing graphics it is worth more than 36 pounds in my opinion i reccomend this game to every person that likes roleplaying flanking and doing epic things",1
"i really dont give a  about this game until ace and acre is finished for this 0/10",2
"arma 3 is a hellacious ride to the underbelly of the america dream. to be able to play with warmachines that your daddies only wish they could handle- this is a showcase of the most badass fighting force in the world and how they handle getting their asses slammed all over the place- you can do everything your heart desires (as long as it means killing real people in a fake world)- other than that, it is a top notch racing game- gotta go fast- gotta be hard- 10/10 for sci-fi majesty",1
"brilliant... simply brilliant. needs some premium hardware to play, but other than that, it is worth your money.",3
"great game, can have all out wars or simply moddify it to be a roleplaying game. but non to less its a great game with lot to do. zeus is a blast with friends making missons on the go.",2
"an unoptimized 8 fps piece of junk. i would rather be stuck in the bathroom unleashing a massive beast than have to watch a slideshow of a game. i can play any other game on ultra with 30+ fps. max payne 3 on ultra gets over 60 fps while this on mega low gets 9 fps total, do not buy this. you would get more out of watching a sesame street episode about elmo talking to a baby about crayons.",2
"this is sick! depending on the type of game, you can team up in wasteland, have an all out war in team death match, snipers are amazing, so many rifles, 3 rocket launchers with a laser guidence system, grenades, smoke, and mortors! i love it",2
"a great simulator with a ton of custom map, scenarios, and mods including dayz and the derivitive breaking point.",1
"seems great, but not worth it at full price, too buggy for that. wait for a smokin deal",1
"the game was absolutely beautiful to look at, graphics were on target 100% but if your a first time arma player the user friendly version is not there. leaves you completely disoreinted almost immediately. camera views while inside the vehicle leave you going for the number pads 0 key a lot. once outside the vehicle your cameras axis is only in the up down view there is no 360 view here boys/ girls. it does however have the genuine military simulation feel. for the amount of times it use the f-bomb youd think you were on a military boat. hence the term make a sailor blush. all in all id give it a 6 out 10.",1
"gr8 gme, luv gettin sick killz. careful tho, easy 2 die. be safe.",1
"the possibilities are endless! :d seriously this game can do pretty much anything if you know how",1
"this game is awesomeballs. its so pretty and the guns work well too. on top of that, the landscapes are huge and pretty. the vehicles are probably its only issue since they sometimes feel like jelly.",1
"pls gift me the game i only have the free one ;-; i will give you a game back! here the games i would like to give you: goat simulator, arma 2 bundle (if on sale again) or any other games that cost 10 or 5 dollars. please and thank you! :d",1
"lag simulator 3 walking simulator 3 get-shot-1km-away simulator 3 overheat simulator 3 like skyrim with guns, would overheat pc again 11/10 ... but seriously. this game is one of the best military games ever. graphics (its hell), gameplay and so on. but, players from battlefield and cod might take a bit more time to be accustomed to the controls. also, prepare your pc  since its gonna get rekt hard boi. ill be buying future arma games to overheat my rig again. 11/10.",1
"this is the game for all of you wanting something more real out of your fps. not for casuals though not so compicated as arma 2.",1
"if you want the closest thing to war a video game can bring, than this is for you. the modding community is strong and you can find a surplus of weapons, vehicles, maps, units, etc, to play with.",4
"hour after hour the game can be enjoyable to an extent but with the serious lack of software support from bi-studios the game is lackluster in how it performs compared to its previous game. they still since the launch of alpha have yet to create a patch for a simplistic bug and are lazy programmers in the least. it seems that the modding community has to pick up the slack of their terrible coding to fix not only simple coding issues but also the major areas just to be able to have good mods...... pretty horrible if you ask me, i would have expected alot more coming from bi-studios.........",3
"poor optimization should be enough to just leave this negitive review wanna play with friends? download 5gb mods of fight other players joining the server wait you cant see any server? restart the whole game to see servers again this is ing pathetic how long the game has been out and joining friends is one of the hardest things to do shooting enemies is a joke, the de-sync is soo off and hit detection is just not okay this game could have been a lot more",2
"this game is damn right amazing if youre into anything military, the vehicles and weapons all look amazing, and firefights never felt so real in gaming. i definitely recommend this game to anyone who has even the slightest knack for anything military/weaponry/flying.",1
"game. it takes a whole mag to kill someone and it takes on bullet to the knee for you to get instantly killed. and evey altis life server is .",1
"this is war! if you like military simulation games this is worth your money.",3
"directing this too people that are coming from arma 2. this game is a complete upgrade from arma 2 overall. graphics are better, inventory system is easier to manage, and how the game runs is better. frame rate is better and more computer friendly for people that dont have super gaming computers. ai are harder and the campaign is relatively enjoyable. multiplayer is fun with wasteland and altis life. wide variety of vehicles and they added new play style such as scuba diving. 9/10 -bigh",1
"first time playing altis life - spawned in - went to the kavala market - bought fresh cool jacket - got run over by a truck immediately 10/10 would die again",1
"very fun and well thought out. single player is exciting and definitely not to easy. multiplayer i get horrible framerates and lag, but that is probably my system/connection. i will definitely keep playing it and recommending it to friends especially as mods are released.",1
"i love the game best war series iv prolly ever played as an fps, even with making your own maps and spawns. but for some the game has stopped working it just that there is an (error 81) i dont know why but very unhappy i just want to be able to play.............",1
"i played the game for 3 days i loved it, it was by far the best game i have ever played",1
"i run it at the lowest settings and get 8 fps but its still fun",1
"arma iii is the latest installment in the franchise and one of the best military simulation games you will ever find in the gaming maket. ive been playing arma since the first operation flashpoint was released in 2001 so when i played arma iii, i felt right at home with its familar ui, controls, and of course the map editor. the map editor will have to be my favorite feature throughout the arma series. you have tons of options to create your own missions so for example, you want to take out a base in the darkness in lone wolf - done! you want to launch a direct armored assault towards an fortified enemy position - done! the options is endless and it doesnt stop there. the arma modding community is what brings more life into the arma franchise. there are tons of limitless mods that enhances the immersion and gaming experience even more. theres also a list of cool gamemodes that changes the gameplay drastically for multiplayer, but to be honest, ive never played any of them, which is quite shameful considering ive been playing the game for the longest time. i have yet played the campaign, but i can tell you that arma iii is the ultimate military simulation. you can say goodbye to call of duty and battlefield. i highly recommend this great game.",2
"this is a great millitary simulator and takes a special type of player to play. it has a great modding community and most content from the previous games can be used in this one if you own them. try the demo of arma ii because this is very similar except for the updated engine. do not expect this to be call of duty, they are not comparable. it is a millitary simulator that requires teamwork and leadership to become successful at. i believe this is the best millitary simulator on the market to date.",2
"easily one of the better military games i have played. really gets the player involved with the battlefield.",1
"campaign is stupid hard. no coop. zeus is fun but only one person at a time. workshop content ranges from wtf ew no to that was really fun with a tendency towards the latter. dont get the game for a fun fps. get it as a military simulater: you take a bullet, youre dead.",1
"i really enjoyed this game but i mostly enjoyed the multiplayer! everything about this game is just great but i would say its a bit overpriced! the community is amazing not like gmod which is filled with kids! 9/10",1
"where taking a bullet in the head is more easy than learn the keyboard control.",1
"good game for these who would like to play a realistic shooter and think for every step you take.",1
"itll make you rage... itll kick you in the teeth... itll suck the essence of your pc like no other (due to bad optimization)... but that sensation of being a tiny cog in a complex machine, of delivering precise cas strikes, of being deep into enemy lines, of engaging that enemy squad so far away from your location... defending kamino against the relentless hordes of csat, battling through the salt fields of altis in your slammer, flying low with your pawnee near the wind generators of the nw, engaging in cqb in the houses of kavala, providing accurate information with your darter while your men advance on pyrgos. it is your war... only thing is choosing how to fight it. the latest of bis, giving the player freedom since 2001.",3
"arma3 is fun to play but i really just bought it to play dayz epoch",1
"the game is fun if you know what you are doing, if you know how to press 5 keys in about 1 seconds time then you will have no problem with the controls. there is a large learning curve when it comes to people coming from games like tf2 or counter-strike. you have to be tactical, and that is what defines the series as a whole. but for $60 i would recomend waiting for a sail even though there is plenty of content to have grounds for a purchase.",1
"best military simulator ive ever played. all its missing is tons of weapons. but what it has is great!",2
"arma 3 though a simmulation game, has some very strong points. mostly being the modding community. the engine its self is built to be as realistic as it can be. it does well it looks great and gives you a real presence in the game. i would recomend it for anyone that enjoys playing with friends in fps.",1
"military simulator with a steep learning curve. by far the most realistic shooter ever made. i love the game, but it is no run and gun bf game.",1
"you want the best in realistic miltary tactical simulation? then muster up your rifles, boys. because this is it.",1
"got into truck, flew across the map 10/10 would ride again",1
"very good game with alot of mods that you can play with yourself and friends!",2
"this is a fantastic fps/tps shooter. for those of you who play cod & battlefield, this is hardcore fps here. beautiful graphics, fantastic freedom, but whats the catch? well, you need a mega pc to run this  game. anything beyond a gtx 690 should run it well on. not sure on amd though. plz cod 9 yr olds, do not ruin this game with your stupid raging. kthxbai",1
"this one extremely good and detailed game :) i liked it a lot",1
"the only game capable of giving the player authentic military warfare - atmosphere. you owe it to yourself to at least try it! full recommendation.",1
"why is this even in my library i dont own it. must be from free weekend that happened 20 years ago and steam needs to do more often. anyway, game was fun but it is definitely not worth $60, plus another $18 for dlc. no way. for $60 you could buy two other games, a four pack of condoms, a bag of doritos, a bucket to use while you play games, and still have a bit left over.",1
"for me it feels that its really hard to get into the game.. first of all for the menu screen with all those settings and  u need a menu-license and without a helping hand to get you into some action u will just run around ingame or drive quad tho if u got someone to help u out this game can be really fun and has alot of content to offer",1
"i got pinned down in a firefight for half an hour, got shot once in the leg, crashed a jet into my teams base, then i started playing arma 3 and i thought it was ok 8/10",1
"this is a great game to play if you are trying to get a headache quickly. 400/10",1
"singleplayer -it has its own unique features in every aspect of the game it has its own style. -the game is just simply perfect. -it has loads of fun playing in singleplayer. multiplayer -once youve step up on multiplayer, i think you couldnt go back on singleplayer, unless if you havent have an internet connection. -the different gamemodes of multiplayer is just simply fantastic! -the gameplay of different gamemodes is stunning! -tons of good words that i could say. **highly recommended** what are you waiting for? buy it, try it, and play it now!",1
"this game is totally worth the money. i play this game everyday. the most fun game you will ever play on the computer.",2
"good games also if still in alpha with a big potential to became one of the best ever",1
"ahhh arma 3 the third expansion of the arma series. i love it and hate it at the same time at different moments. the increased modding capabilities really made me really interested. the main thing that really disappointed me was the lack of variety in the weapons and vehicle department. they werent really unique but the gear system helped add more variety to the cosmetics of the characters but, that doesnt really help due to the fact the weapons dont have much variety. i love the arma 3 campaign, not as personal and deep as the arma 2 campaign but still fun. there are still soo many bugs that need fixing and optimization for multiplayer fps wise is very bad at the moment too. i still give this game a 7/10 since it has many abilities from arma 2 and is still fun. expect a lot of bugs though and a few random fps drops but, that doesnt really effect the gameplay as much.",1
"simple this is a semi (heheee) hardcore simulation of modern warfare as close as you can get without it getting too sim heavy been with this series since flashpoint days, every release gets closer to realizing the full potential of the developers ambitious idea. its not for everyone, you really need to give the game time and slow down the way you tackle things. the game engine and its tools has plenty of ability to give the creative minded lots of options too. keep up the great work, cant wait to see what you treat us with next.",1
"i paid over $50 us for half of a game and i cant even play on multiplayer very unhappy with with game and the developers game with it or refund my money",1
"spawn in altis life, get robbed, kidnapped, organs stolen then ransomed. excellent.",1
"i first started with operaiton flashpoint which was basically seed of arma, i then got arma2. now i have arma3. now much has changed, but better graphics. pros -nice graphics, -great freedom -military simulator. -good story -great fire fights (in city area and town areas) cons -ai seems to be diffcult, seem to know where you are really quickly. i found it diffcult in fire fights in forests because the grass and if you stand up you get shot. -objects such rocks collision box seems always get in the way. -game mechancies dont seem to work like other first person shooters (takes a while to get used to) -extremely simulated to point you have two types of walks and runs which can get confusing. conculsion, its a really indepth game, great exploration and different type of senarios. i think the development team should consider re working the ai and create an option for a more simplifed control system, maybe even enabling the option to disable injury simulation. i think this causes many frustration to people playing the game.",1
"amazing visuals just stunning but i really dont care its the gameplay that matters and oh boy that is amazing so much to choose from such as altis life (many peoples favourites personally i cant get into something like that) and then wasteland an open world sandbox and oh dont forget mods 90% of my game time is with mods such as battle royale (great mod that gameplay is like the hungergames but really it is based on a japanese movie called battle royale) and also i played alot of breaking point (like dayz)",1
"it feels like soldiers who have never played a videogame made arma iii. this game is the most unintuitive, glitchty mess ive seen in a long time. simply not enjoyable to play. annoyingly, it seems so promising as a large-scale shooter, but it just doesnt have the quality to really satisfy that niche. the optimization is abysmal; completely unplayable problems arising from strange performance issues are frustratingly common. there are common glitches that break the game, such as ladders and walls magically killing you. its not worth the money for this kind of attention to detail. do not buy arma games unless the devs suck your  in return.",1
"dont even look at the price just buy it, its to good to even call it a game. its a simulator .......",4
"i recommend this game, to all the fps/sim players!",3
"arma iii a game of many things, this will be one of my personal favorites. the game is set on two islands based in the aegean sea, altis a large real life island (limnos in real life) and stratis a small satallite island (agios efstratios in real life). the setting is great with largley mixed enviroments ranging from beutifully desgined housing complexes, dry salt lakes and pine forests this really puts a great game world in perspective. combat is intense and quick paced, forcing you to make split second desicions like do i take out machine gunner who is pinning down our squad or do i kill the rpg trooper before he destroys the tank. this puts some inexpirienced gamers to the test and even the pro can still be the noob. there are many things wrong with arma iii, one of which is it has a feeling of lack of completion to it like it claims to have a wopping 40 wepons when arma 2 had about 60+. the game is buggy and contains many performance issues. the game has only been released for a few months but has gone through alpha and beta phases so the game is not up to scratch as it could be. i would recommend this game to anyone looking for great communitys and someone who is looking for something new.",1
"bohemia interactive have really created something special here, top of the line military simulator an experience like no other. for those unfamiliar with what a military simulator game entitles here is a few of the things you will be doing in altis and stratis the two maps in game which are ridiculously huge: - gokarting - flying helicopters to the max height and then skydiving to your death - dealing drugs and becoming terrorists in altis life - having a great time attaching .50 cals to your gokart and killing your friends - great community workshop maps and missions such as the lost doge and skytrack 3000 - having intense raves with glowsticks and coloured smoke the list goes on, in conclusion buy this game",1
"this game is amazing and the custom played scenarios is out of this world i completely love this game i just bought it today and already put in 8 hrs. the only downfall is that the control scheme is hard to master but if your an arma veteran it wont be a problem. love this game totally worth the money.",1
"the most joy you will get from this game isnt in the playing itself, but instead the creating of your own custom content and seeing others enjoy it.",4
"it was feckin amazing. i recommend it to everyone but the only downside is you need a good ammount of cpus otherwise you will struggle to get even 10 fps",1
"good game iwth weapon resting mod. i got aids and lived to tel l this tale,",3
"if you liked operation flashpoint, this game can at least catch up",1
"i recommend this game if its on sale, but if it isnt, its not really worth 49.99 euro. but its still fun andreally great looking.",1
"this game is truly amazing. the things you can do in this game can range from a serious singleplayer mission to flying cows and shooting rabbit missiles at your enemies with your friends. this game also has an in-game editor which is easy to use and lets you create your own mods and distribute them in the steam workshop with no expenses at all. it also has multiplayer with many game modes, most of them are user-generated. the only problem is that the only mods that the workshop offers are scenarios (missions) and gamemodes, so if you want the big mods with new maps, weapons, vehicles and skins, you need to download and install them from the internet.",1
"very strategic and requires skill more than anything.",2
"still buggy as previous armas. a lot of frustrating desync. not much main content, but big mod support. not worth it.",1
"i played cod, its ok i played battlefield, its cool i played this for a day... meh. its a game.",1
"im just not enjoying it. i really am trying because i see all these great reviews. as a solo player it kinda sucks. i can see how playing in a group would make it much better tho. i love military sims but this one is to buggy and clucky and just not fun, for me anyway. maybe in the future, if i join up with some peeps it might make it fun.",1
"where is my deluxe edition extra content that i paid for???",1
"this game is probably if not the best modern (well almost modern) first/third realistic warfare simulator you can get out there... it may not have content worth $60, but the modding community on this game keep it going and keep adding new content to the game.. if you want a version of this game (with worse graphics,animations, and ai) but has loads of more content play arma 2 combined ops its cheaper... but i recomend this game do to its shear scale and the improved engine... in all both games i recommend but this one stands out... if anything buy this game on sale.",1
"this game is almost the perfect pc game (in my oppinion) however it would be great if the game ran a little bit better but apart from that you can mod the living  out of it and spend hundreds of hours playing the various life mods! 12/10 - me :d",2
"im not impressed with arma 3. sure, sure the graphics are better along with the game play, but they changed so much about it im no longer conforted by the play style arma 1-2 (including ao) offered. in my opinion arma 3 ruined the fun. why: -movment type (always jogging no walk option like in a1-2 & ao) -driving is now a total b**** (cars slide like soap) -half the steam content doesnt work ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- im voting yes but i say no. it is worthy of a little play time (maybe an hour a day to keep the jerks away)",1
"oh yes. this game is everything right with military simulators. realistism at its best, (minus some of the arma physics). get it.",1
"the military simulator on the market. steam workshop provides nearly limitless amounts of play time.",2
"there is no reason to not get this game. if you like military shooters, this is the masterpiece you were missing from your collection.",2
"i like this game, it is mostly realistic, no bullcrap, and well set up. because it is a realistic shooter, it can sometimes get boring, but its worth it. i recommend buying this",2
"havent countered any glitches unlike its predecessor. playing the game tactically is always a must. it adds the greatness online when you play tactically online with others.",1
"wish i could get a refund, it crashes everytime i try to play. even after following guides to fix all the problems, i even factory reset my computer twice and asked support for help. yet, nothing. gg. maybe stop breaking the game with every update, itd be nice.",2
"lol i dont even own it wtf y can i do this 10/10 would recommend to other pants. edit: why do i have one hour lol",1
"well what can i say, massive mp game, this is what u are looking for, alot of action,cars,tank,helis, all that u need",2
"at first this game was a lot of fun to play. but with the time it rather got worse than good. - the game does not go above 29 fps for me (on i7 4770k, gtx 770, ssd) - it easily drops under 20 fps when there is a bit of vehicle movement around the map - the ai is programmed really bad. not finding paths. not moving at all when told to. the game is just as good without ai as it is with them. maybe some dummy targets for your enemies. which again are overly op compared to your ai... - since the shutdown of gamespy it is completely unavailable for coop missions with friends. hosting steam servers was not working since the games release and last but not least the price is way too high for a game said to be still under development i regret every cent of the 45 euros which i payed for this game.",1
"my first day playing a3 was awfull now i just cant quit ,its too good its as good as it gets now i know why ppl call it an army simulator cus it is",2
"bought this game 1 year ago afther i build my own game pc one of the best games i have ever purchased there are so many diffrent mods you can have fun in like the all new overpoch from arma 2 now in arma 3 :d wasteland,battleroyale and all the hours of playing altis life and being a good civi or a cold blooded criminal the wrokshop is a good place to find some awesome singleplayer mission or co-op missions to do with your friends still love this game afther 1 year 10/10",1
"i know this is still in development, however the game mechanics were not smooth enough to enjoy the gameplay.. 3/10",1
"best teamplay game i ever seen :) 15/10 +graphic +singleplayer +multiplay <3",1
"this is a brilliant army based game even better than call of duty",1
"this game is amazing. while the campaign is not what you should by the game for multiplayer modes are the greatest thing you can play. modes like wasteland and altis life are great. if you have to buy one game this should be it.",1
"i have been a fan of tactical shooters for as long as i can remember, my first one being the original rainbow six and all of its additions. hidden and dangerous, ghost recon, and the game that spawned this one operation flashpoint. as buggy and screwed up as that game was i was still able to eveintually play it. not the case with this game. there is no excuse for the graphical bugs and gameplay issues present in this game. there has been ample time for this game to be optimized and yet it is still a mess. i am able to play every graphic intensive game out there on my system yet this one is barely playable. it seems some people have been able to get it to work but no luck here. this is unfortunate as it looks like i would love this type of gameplay based on my history however looks like ill never find out since i cant even get it to run properly.",1
"anti-tank simulator. fences are the main weakness to every vehicle in the game. remember this. also trying to jump over a trash can will instantly kill you. 10/10",2
"arma 3 hits the spot nicely, loving the co-op missions.",5
"other than the few glitches and bugs, this game is about the best simulator i have ever played. its your call! you can play it serious such as rpg servers or even for fun such as stratis-altis- life. the mods available are very fun and diverse! top notch!",1
"why cant this game be cheaper. i mean its fun but at $35, rust is only $20",1
"this game is like my life. its long, boring, nothing ever happens but i still for some reason cant end it.",2
"really awesome game, especially if you have some nice people to play with... well, its a tactical shooter, so you need good teamplay!",3
"its only fun with friends i recomend having a group or team to play with 9/10 would bang again",1
"sp campaign is good, up until the point when you are put in charge of a group of rebel vegetables also known as callsign omega, tasked with making your campaign as unplayable as possible. from then on arma3 offers an infinite variety of innovative and dynamic ways for the ai to  with your game, making you lose and replay missions for hours over and over again (you just cant guess whats gonna go wrong next time!). despite that, the multiplayer is amazing and is what makes the game worth buying.",2
"brilliant game but be sure to buy it on  as its really to exspensive for what you get. what you do get is a brilliant campaign, top of the line graphics. weapons, sounds, vehicles and the map are very well done! multiplayer is fun and easy to make friends on e.g (altis life) workshop includes a ton of content and mod support is crazy into-depth. i get lost in the maps theyre that big. however, this game is hard to run making expensive graphics cards seem like your entry cards, that may be a beta thing but you definatly wont have 60 fps unless you have a gtx titan. overall i reccomend this game 8/10 hours of fun",1
"sheitty dlc that is about the same price of the full game? hell yeah! optimization? naaahhh who needs that.",1
"i thought i would love this game, but after dealing with sloppy menu systems, unoptimized game settings, and ridiculously varying quality in gameplay, i just wish i never spent the money on this. all the online gameplay shown is under incredibly set terms that youll almost never see without dedicating a ton of time to a community with a teamspeak.",1
"amazing game, you all need to pick this up if you like realistic combat. harsh for any new player to master but when you get the the feel of the game and master the controls its great fun!",2
"love this game could play for the rest of forever just need to make the dlc free and add in new gun skins aswell as new air/land/sea vehicles. other than this its a beautifull game.",5
"collect flowers and bugs in the lands of altis and stratis with a bit of get f*cked up the rear while doing it. 9/10",5
"it will take about 20-30 hours of playing single player to figure out how arma works. then once you go online, you will spend another 10 hours until you really start enjoying it. but once you get into it, there is nothing like it, and it will be the most amazing game you have ever played.",1
"arma 3 broken game broken promises. arma 3 alpha comes out, has great voice over quality, great hit registry, guns work when you shoot them. they update it. broken voice over, broken hit registry (90% of bullets dont register a hit), car physics are for trolls, all the servers are run by admin and friends (donate money and they will ban whoever you dont like), planes dont work, aa shoot you down from 5 km away. the only thing fun is flying a helicopter. running is broken in the game. play epoch mod and get shot by a five year old hiding in the bushes in his underwear. bad games made worse. just pretty graphics, however half the servers run terribly and dont support high frames so even if you have a nice computer good luck getting good frames. would have been great if they just left it in alpha instead of screwing it up.",2
"this is a really good game, i enjoy playing this game loads. the amount of gamemodes is great as theres loads of things to do and popular gamemodes such as wasteland can give you hours of fun. worth the money 100%",2
"you can kill someone by dropping an airlifted ammo crate on their head. nuff said. 11/10",2
"this game is to fun i cant believe they put this much time on this game. i wonder if their going to make arma 4",1
"i prefer arma 2, the current day wepaons not bug eyes yawnsville.",3
"this game is legit and amazing. the devs try not to call it a sim but its as close as you can get while still being a game. its very realistic with damage and weight models. body armor and helmets give a degree of protection. the same applies to the variation of vehicles in the game. the 2 maps are huge and there are plans for dlc in the future which will no doubt add on to that. speaking of addons the giant mod community for the game is always hard at work making new missions, weapons, and vehicles to add into the game free of charge. there is endless replayablility with this game and if youre a shooter/military game fan then this should be in your library. honestly, if the game was more optimised (insane cpu usage for projectile physics and ai decision making) i wouldnt even play half of the other shooters that are out today because arma does it all and more. pick this game up!",3
"ok. i think, generally this game is a truly beatiful modern warfare simulator. this is really one of the best milsim game ever. but. there is a cons, and, of course there are situations that force you to say something like this: wtf ? my ai teammate stuck in a lying box ? seriously ? - especially if the situation is tough and you need fire support from your team. so, ai is really stupid. its a rare thing for your teammates to properly find optimal waypoint, even, if they just walking behind you. and, of course question of the overall game performance. 4770k/16gb ram/2xsli 780 and frame drops to 4-5 fps when there are huge explosions. again, i want to ask the developers - seriosly ? ok. guys, just optimize the performance, please - this is a really great game suffering from bugs and really bad netcode.",1
"obviously, youll know what youre getting into if youve played, and had fun playing arma ii. potenetial for some really fun mutliplayer experiences, and a whole bunch of missions on the workshop to play on your own. huge map and great game mechanics.",3
"realism: this is the key of this game but it is realistic for real ? if youre a gamer you could probably say yeah becouse there are some elements that makes everything feel a real war... ...but (!!!) in my opinion this realism is not so realistic. war feeling is awesome but the bad things on this game are the details ( weapons reload, medkit others, repairing vehicles, your blood that desappears when you put adrenaline (???) in yourself...) this game is worth buying for people who likes the genre, but i expect more couring of details in next patches .",1
"this game is not for the console kids that play cod all day. this is a difficult but fun game. if you look at the negative reviews on it the reviewers have 300 to 700+ hours in this game... thats not the amount of hours you put in this game if you dont like it.... i dont get it.. anyways. if you choose to buy this game get vac. it will save your life. the community behind this game is huge and there is always new player created missions and content available. theres also breaking point mod for arma 3. basically dayz for arma 3. which i think is better than sa. the guys saying they get low fps... one saying he gets 10 frames?? its a demanding game... play it on something besides the laptop you bought at wal-mart... bohemia labels it a military sim... thats what it is. its most def not a run and shoot.",5
"if youre looking for a get on the battlefield and start hip-fire killing, this is not the game for you. this game takes a lot of time. it is a very comprehensive combat simulator incorporating some of the best graphics available, as well as hundreds (literally) of tactical options and configurations. very fun but also very intensive learning curve.",1
"most realistic army simulator? more like the most realistic b*llsh*t simulator. this game is about as unrealistic as whales with detachable pen*ses that fly to jupiter and f*ck jupiters babies while on steroids. i can name 3 games more realistic than this right now. world of warcraft. toontown. fapville on steroids extreme. those are all 10x more realistic. but if you wanna hear the big black juicy good parts of this game well here they are. this game features breaking your legs from 3 foots drops. dying from jumping out of a vehicle moving 2 kph. dying from drowning in an enclosed submarine. derping from lsd that you got from a f*cking hobo. but best of all dont forget the jerk circles. (this review was made entirely for comedy purposes) serious part -----> this game is pretty bad and they keep making it worse",1
"even though i just started playing this game, i would already say it was worth my $60. the graphics are amazing and the detail makes everything look cool af. the only cons i would say are there are so many different controls that you will be referring to the field manual very often. also, the keybindings are very awkward. for people that play different fps often and are used to things like ctrl or c for crouch or space to jump or e for interact, theyll be annoyed when they constantly forget its x to crouch. i was also sort of pissed that i couldnt change the keybindings...",1
"this is a really good game, provides many hours of goodness. favorite thing to do is wasteland with freinds.",2
"who reads reviews anyway. just buy the ing game, its worth it.",1
"great game.gives you that original war feeling.for those who are interested in tactical gaming this is the game for you.",1
"severly clunky animations, appallingly bad gunplay and still buggy months after release, will never buy another game from this company that expects the modding community to produce content for them. it makes me sick that i actually spent money on this utter trash. so poorly optomized it runs under 60fps on a fairly high end system that runs bf4 on ultra at over 80fps.",3
"arma iii is a combat simulator. it creates an envioroment where you can perform and learn the basics of the movement of a military soldier. the campaign is really good, there is nothing wrong with it at all except from where i find it hard at some cases. but overall it holds a realistic simulation of how its like. i also love multiplayer on arma iii. people can transform co-op gamemodes to a realistic enviroment in multiplayer, like some people can form squads and they like to make it look like a real squad which contains planning, tatical, commands, things like that. it makes the game look real. arma iii was released 7 months ago but grows a better game each time. there are certain amount of bugs and glitches in it but its very rare the bugs or glitches occur.... the game is quite expensive i know, its 35.99 but its good to spend money on a brilliant game like this. if you want to spend more on it you can buy digital deluxe upgrade for 8.99. i recommend buying the deluxe edition for 39.99, make sure you like what you are buying of the deluxe edition. when you buy this game i hope you have alot of fun. thanks!",2
"i find this to be one of the better open world games that i have played in a long time but the driving in this game is a little tricking but i do recomend it to others as it is a really fun gamr to get and if you get the ccg launchers it makes it even more fun as this then brings in the construction of building and also the few zombies that i have come accross make the game a little more challanging but all in all awsome game have fun boys and girls",1
"by far one of the best games on steam , well worth the money and a very enjoyable game , so much to do",3
"great game, theyve improved the singleplayer and the engine alot since arma 2. and the multiplayer is ofc 1st class with friends!",1
"arma 3 was awesome and good but sometimes lag in some places or situation.",1
"nice game nice graphics i will buy it :d team work on first place !",1
"just dont cheat or use artmoney or youll have to buy a new game haha :/",1
"youd think this game would be amazing. but it is. buy it and give it all your money now you ing losers. what are you doing with your lives you ing  ups 10/10 its alright.",3
"everything about this game is great. the shooting and aiming is hard to master and actually following orders is a must unlike most military games. driving and flying is fun and the diffrence in power from a single solider to a tank is realistic e.g one missle wont take out a full tank. my only issue with the game at the moment is the ai either sucks or wrecks you.",1
"this is the best military shooter i have ever played. with the option to download and create content from the workshop you have the option to play this game for ever !! only downside is the fact that i need to wait for the campaign but hey enough to do until then ! 9/10",1
"gives me hours of enjoyment. worth the $60. and i highly recomend.",1
"fun game, very in depth if felt for an fps. you should have patience for some servers though, they will be figuring out which line you should stand in more than they will be doing stuff. if you like planetside 2 for the organization or players, this game will be fun for you.",1
"the worlds finest modern warfare simulator. pros: the infantry experience is sublime, with enormous map, beautiful and diverse environments, great freedom of movement and very comprehensive controls. inclusion of combat divers and paratroopers. aircraft, helicopters, wheeled and tracked vehicles and boats work great as instruments for inserting infantry and supporting them. real-world tactics works. great community, including a very comprehensive guide by dslyecxi. trackir is supported. a trackir is highly recommended, and adds enormously to both immersion and situational awareness. singleplayer campaign is competent, but i belive the most fun is to be had with user-created content or in online games with the milsim-crowd. cons: i would prefer contemporary military hardware instead of near-future. controls are optimised for outdoors action, and feels a bit clumsy inside buildings. controls on aircraft and helicopters are extremely simplified compared to dedicated flightsimulators. this is probably a design choice for reasons of accessibility, but the new dlc promises helicopters with more advanced controls. hope this starts a trend of more proper simulation of helicopters and aircraft. highly recommended!",1
"i dont even own this game, but really want it, 10/10 would write a review for a game i dont own again",1
"in all honesty, this game is worse than arma 2 in the simulator area. it just doesnt have the same feel as previous games nor the community. the down fall of the series had to be the creation of many community game types created to cater to the causual gamer community, and now arma 3 feels more like any old fps game since bohemia interactive has not been creating the game with their hardcore fans in mind. there are many instances of copy and pasts from previous games and there were many corners cut and promised features left out to get the game out quicker. this is why i will continue to play arma 2 and not this lousy game. i find it hard to call arma 3 a part of the arma/armed assault series.",1
"really good looking game but its not for low or medium end pcs",1
"one of the best games ive ever played, highly recomended.",3
"if you want realism in a shooter, this is where you go. the bullet drop and lag make this game challenging along with the one shot death`s that happen alot. using their new cover system. you can go behind cover and shoot stuff that you never could before.",1
"im doing a damn thumbs down -100/+100 because cant play because of game executable not found, please repair your game through steam client, well well well ive done this for he past 67 hours i only got the game a few days ago so simply put im almost done even trying to play it 69.99 not worth it in my opinion ill change my comment when or if im ever able to play it (p.s. verify doesnt work uninstall and reinstall hasnt worked for the past 13 frigin times so i dout 14 times will make a difference. gotten rid of the app cache in programsx86 and only thing that did was screw my saints row 4 over royaly doing the same damn thing now. so if the devs are reading this send me a usable working video of someone fixing missing executable that has not been mentioned in this comment. btw same problem with starmade, saints row 4, facerig, face of mankind, goat simulater, and guns of icarus.",1
"late to the party with this title, but im just starting to explore all the content. well worth the money.",1
"i have changed this to a positive review as originally i was very dissapointed with the vanilla of this, only with weapon mods and a3l will you have a fun experiance witht his game",3
"this game has many bugs and issues but they are overlooked when you are playing because it is just so much fun. i play wasteland personally because when i play with friends its just so entertaining. there are not many gamemode/missions but they are fun to play. i would recommend anyone this for the multiplayer with or without friends. the single player campaign is good to so if you are not up for multiplayer that will keep you entertained.",1
"earlier today i was in a game where this guy jack would just repeatedly teamkill everyone. the person in charge of the game smote him with a ing crazy lightning bolt, and spawn butterflys on his corpse. then we had an atv race down a ravine, and the gm called a missile strike on the finish line. 10/10 would play again.",1
"ever wondered how it feels to be a muscular, hard- operator? well too bad, youre a scrawny ing toy soldier with futuristic gadgets which does all the fighting for you so all you get to do is walk around in your undies while in base. i want a refund, this isnt what i payed for, even for an alpha. however, bis sure nailed that underwear buldge just right. 9/10 average rail-shooter.",2
"very good game and sequel to arma 2. multiplayer is quite fun but also quite difficult for some newbies out there to online shooters. but to the more experienced hand this game is a must have. 10/10",4
"lots and lots of glitches... could of been way better then that. i would never spend 59$ on this game... good thing i bought it when it was in beta.",1
"trying to shoot snipers hanging off the side of a helicopter 10/10.",2
"pro: the game is realistic con: it is expensive and it may lag for players.",1
"this is a wonderful game, ive put my fair share of hours into it and needless to say this game is great to play with a nice, large, organized group of people to play with, there are plenty of gamemodes to play and plenty of groups to join for this game",4
"this game is definitely worth $50. i mean, who doesnt want to be a drug lord in altis life?",1
"arma is good, but i dont recommend downloading it on a 64 bit pc... ive been having problems with it... like so... my graphics drive keeps crashing even though i can run up to 4 gigs of ram.",3
"seems like a good game only did the training part but seemed good",1
"for an alpha it is great! cant wait for beta in a couple of weeks, and then the full release later. there are some performance bugs, but the freedom in multiplayer is unmatched.",1
"absolutely incredible game, a sandbox more than anything else with practically limitless possibilities. whether you prefer to role play, simulate actual battle scenarios or simply blow stuff up with advanced modern weaponry this game can cater for it all. whilst you do get some performance issues, especially on lower spec systems they are really nothing which should put you off. i recommend this 100% to any gamer.",2
"cant tell you if you should buy it or not, but i can tell you this. you will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have. but when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, its something magical you just cant find in any other game. arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. you buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. arma is a game which you can never called finished. there will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! ill give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back. read: i will not accept random friend requests! if you have a question, please post it in the comments.",5
"this game is a military simulator. its very fun to play and instead of running into rooms guns blazing like most shooters there is a lot more stratergy in this. it has quite a few mods that you can download from playwithsix and the workshop now. im in a group called special team delta and we do operations every weekend and they are pretty fun. even without my group i can have fun on public servers playing wasteland or koth. the story is very good and is a good length. there are optimisation problems with the game. i cant really get over 50 fps on high with my $900 computer but even on 15fps it is still playable.",3
"despite its glitches, this is a solid game. dont expect your cod skillset to roll over though.",1
"having so much fun with this, especially with wasteland.",1
"arma 3 is great with friends and also when your board you can mhave fun with other people.",1
"this game should be for the mac osx operating system!",1
"this game is awesome, you have to try out stratis wasteland or king of the hill game modes :p",1
"arma (3) is not the typical shooter you would imagine. it is way more then that. the really cool thing about arma is that its trying to simulate a real war scenario. that does not really work obviously , because its a game. the reason why i still recommend this game to everyone , is because it is still a really well made game. the amount of time , fun , effort , realism , roleplaying and strategy you can put in this game is endless. people always come up with new and really cool scenarios like sniping , infantry combat , underwater combat , mechanized infantry combat , air combat and so many more things you can put in front of combat :p :d. turning that around , you also have a really good editor to develop your own missions and scenarios. this game is awsome , and everybody whos looking for something new and good : take it! :)",1
"why can i write a review dont even have the game lol",1
"the best and most realistic military simulator thus far! i wold recommend this game to anyone who likes military games and simulators like arma 2 and this.",1
"i swam for 30 minutes and the black man ran over by boat.",1
"boring simulator 2014. love feeling bored? is your life not complete without pointless derision? then arma 3 is the game for you! you can take long walks with friends and talk about everything from the weather, the first time you got laid, or how you miss moms home cooking. if you join a full server, and stay in it for 3 hours at a time...you do run the risk of eventually encountering enemy combatants. this occurence is rare but known to happen. not to worry. you will die instantly and get to start the process all over again. so make sure that you read up on politics, sports, and current events so that you dont bore your online friends while on your long walks together. and for those having trouble figuring out the controls...lshift + tab + r + t will tie your right bootlace, should it happen to come untied during one of your walks. substitute r for l if its the left boot that comes untied first. on a side note, this game has a great online community. if you are new and need help...just ask. you will promptly be addressed and told to go **** yourself.",2
"blows all other military shooters and previous arma games away",1
"well at the moment i think this game is not for action game players or absolute novices. it is game about walking long distances (as you cant run as you always are tired and out of breath) just to shoot few bullets and get killed. as a military game i believe it is best what you can get - forget that stuff like call of duty or battlefield. personally - this game is not for me and every moment i get pissed off a lot in it. recommend only for someone who is looking for very serious ang high quality games.",1
"nothing beats popping a tire on a road sign and having to walk 10km to the nearest repair kit 10/10 i only really play this when i have a whole afternoon of nothing to do",2
"really funny game. just shoot tryhards and watch them get mad.",1
"lots of fun, definitely better than arma ii plays more like an fps, since it doesnt feel as clunky as arma ii was. you can attach and remove scopes and ammunition without using ammoboxes, it is better trust me. ing awesome.",1
"this game is for real bros who like to play a realistic, no kiddie, true to life battle simulator. this game can be anything you want it to be. i was playing with a clan but it was too involved. if you are sick of battlefield 3.1 or cod50,000 then play this game. this game is going to get better and better as time goes along. just think about it; arma2:oa came out in 2010 and people were still modding and improving it summer 2013. farcry 3 is allegedly skyrim with guns but this game truly is. look for weather fx, 25 km squared maps; everything. definitely a must buy.",1
"great game when played correctly. hard to get used to and the community isnt very helpful, but it works out eventually. best played woth friends/people you know that wont  around. i give it a 7/10 for its great graphics, superb gameplay, and immersion in modern combat.",1
"10/10 real life simulator in a third world country.",1
"zeus was the best thing to ever happen to this game!",1
"so far i have put hundreds of hours into arma 3, i spent most of it on a game mode called altis life which i am sure most of you have heard of, it is incredibly entertaining but that is not all that comes with arma 3. i recommend the campaign for its interesting and fun story alongside some awesome gameplay you wont see outside of the campaign, there is also wasteland you can try as it offers constant pvp while aiming for interesting objectives, and i also recommend battle royale that you can download from play with six. over all this game is absolutely worth the money, i personally spent 20 on this game when it was on sale and i do recommend purchasing it for around that price, as 35 is a bit much and if you got to sites like  you will get it for a nice price, so yes please do yourself the favor of purchasing the game as it will bring so much more to your gaming experiences.",3
"love this game. would recommend to anyone who has played the arma series.",1
"i love it. its definitely harder than i was expecting. every different aspect of this game has its own learning curve. but i like the challenge. very fun game and it has great visuals.",1
"great game!altis life and wasteland are by far the funnnest",2
"the is without a doubt the next generation in an epic military simulation series",4
"great war simulation game ! i recommend it to all people who loves real action combat, but you might need a decent config for it.",1
"arma 3 is the latest game made by bohemia interactive. it is absolutly beautifull when on high graphics. lots of possibilties for modding, *cough* arma-holic *cough*. a new mod has surfaced called arma 3 takistan life. its the arma 2 taki life mod ported but it feels better. arma 3 altis life is very good. many servers and lots of fun to be had. as you can see from my hours on this account alone arma 3 is a very enjoyable game. its also a very very good combat simulator. king of the hill is one of the most enjoyable. the new karts dlc is very fun to play with friends and the zeus dlc is brilliant. great for multiplayer missions. get this game 9.5/10. 0.5 - waiting for my battleships ! bohemia. :)",3
"anything from traditional military gameplay like capture the objective and king of the hill to open world pvp modes like wasteland and breaking point to role playing games like altis life. i doubt you will get bored of this fantastic game.",4
"totaly worth the money there are many things u can do and even good things to do in single player i strongly recommend this game to people who like the realistic type of shooters",1
"one of my favourite game, but yeah for that price... i bought it in the alpha (earlyacces) and now it is a really good tactic-shooter with some vehicles and a a great modsupport, but i think its still in kinda developingphase, cause there ar so many things they should add, but its really cool and its funny to try some things in the missioneditor.",2
"can we fix it? no its ed! this simple but modest experience is brought to you by bohemia interactive. a company capable of releasing 1.2 gb updates that dont fix the simplest but most annoying flaws of the game that only exist because of their servere inability in the first place. keep on gaming... something else.",2
"i won this game in a giveaway since then im addicted",1
"what a beautiful beast of a game do i recommend this game?...... well.... yes. this is the buisness",1
"one has not lived until they have experienced this!!!! i have a bit of an obsession with arma, owning all of their games (or simulations for the more of the anal ones out there) and i was reluctant to purchase this on the merit that i didnt think it would be much better than arma 2, however, i was very mistaken and this is indeed the best installment in the series and they clearly put more work into te singleplayer too! buy it!!!!! actually, buy 2!!!! 10/10 would realise it is the best thing ever agian",1
"best game in the world armaa iii is one of the best games ive ever played in my life... cause its not just a war simulator... all the people would like this game cause : 1- if youre a kind of man who likes rpg games then you can just go and play arma iii altis life or the life mod... 2-if youre a kind of man who likes survival games then you can just install epoch or breaking bad mod and enjoy it 3-if you like pvp games you can just play arma iii wasteland or king of the hill or coop mod... so as you can see arma iii is just full of different mods and stuff... but people dont have same feelings...i like this game i my self but a guy with different feelings and needs would not . so youre the guy who chooses what to play i hope this review be helpful... and sorry for bad english :)",1
"breathtaking graphics, fantastic gameplay, and a superior feeling to the controls since arma ii. the mod community are already blowing up on this. for those who enjoyed arma ii this is a must buy. for those new to the arma series, jump straight in on this, get moding, get building scenarios and i guarrantee youll never play cod or battlefield again.",1
"if you like mods and love simulations then this game is worth it. theres many things that you can do within this sexy game, things that involve (tactical bacon)! just make sure to have friends or to be with a simulation mislim when playing.",3
"if your looking for a good military simulator, arma 3 is a game for you, there is a few bugs, but other than that, its provides a very good experience for casual and hardcore gamers, you should also check out arma 2, operation arrowhead and many more amazing games by bohemia interactive!",2
"a whole bunch of fun and unique confrontations. 10/10",1
"reallistic fps and third person! guns, planes, cars , tanks , jets , helicopters this is war! in game mods! role playing game! 9/10 no lag no bug",1
"i dont know how to get in to severs it kicks me out all the time why ??",1
"great military game with loads of gadgets, vehicles, and customization!! 10 out of 10!!!",1
"amazing game. well optomized. will run on a cereal box with 30+ fps on full graphical seetings. amazing multiplayer experiences and well worth the money.",1
"ok where too start, the game is fun and if you have a group of friends even better, now with that said the game is laggy and when i say laggy i mean very laggy. im running a 290x with an 8320 asrock mobo and it still cant run this game you want too know why, they dont give a  you got it now your stuck with it, they dont fix anything just save your money and get something else maybe if you have an intel it may run better but my brother have intel and you know what he cant run it either so dont get it im telling you right now you will be sorry. and whats sad is i love the game when i can play it, its a good game but oh man does it suck",1
"after several months of trying to use this game i have had enough. today the latest update removed all the mods in expansions (with no guidance about how to reinstall them) that made this half completed game playable. despite its huge potential and possibilities, bi have developed and sold a half completed game thats over complex, unintuitive, with poor; single play functions, gameplay and ai command & control, editing and character / vehicle modifications. despite excellent features (virtual arsenal and editor) they are not interconnected but isolated elements requiring complex and out of game processes to bring them together! when was this acceptable? for some reason its set in 2030 (why?) and relies far to heavily on the modding community to make up for its fundamental weaknesses (e.g. bipods for lmg and snipers rifles are an urgent requirement you can not use the weapons effectively (or realistically). but no bohemia interactive priorities go carts over critical game weakness to be addressed, waiting 2 years to have this addressed in the dlc stream, can i ask how i get my money back please?",1
"awesome game if you are planning on playing the mods, such as epoch, armageddon, wastelend, etc. in that case this game is soo good! buy it!",1
"stepped on a mine at the end of a mission, after it said i completed said mission. at the start of the next one, i am immediately dead. thought i could make it work by replaying the previous mission, but no. still dead. cant continue the campaign. but other than that, pretty cool game. blisteringly difficult, most of the times you die, you will have no idea who shot you, or where it was coming from.",1
"its only in alpha and it still walks, flys, drives and dives all over all the tunnel shooters! a real improvement over arma 2 which i loved for all its faults. get it, try it now!",3
"this game is still a bit buggy since release but thats to be expected with such a large project. i have a lot of fun playing the campaign but the most fun comes out of the community made gametypes. i definitely reccomend this game!",1
"great game, mods for days and constant updates make the game on point. arma 3 is a must buy if you are into fps arma/day z games.",2
"there we sat, a small squad of eight men. all ready for the order from our captain. then a voice could be heard. it was another man screaming. then gunshots, then silence. our squad leader told us to move up into a defensive position and lay wait in ambush for the convoy to come along. so we did, then we heard a ton of gunshots. yet we still waited. then we heard women screaming, then children. we knew the gunshots were akms and we thought they were in a firefight with civillians in the middle. then the trucks came. truck after truck, i counted 7. everyone in my squad just stared. then i noticed the others were standing up. i stood up too in case i was missing something. then i heard a whistle and the commander exploded, same with his second-in-command. i ran away, and never saw my squad again. i hope you like my story of a somewhat realistic interpration of the game. this is a really good game. no doubt, but i dont think i like the semi-futuristic time period in the game. i would have preferred something in the more near future. in the end thought its an awesome game, and once you finish the campaign, you can spend countless hours playing multiplayer. and if you get bored of that you can enjoy the power of full steam workshop integration and download other peoples scenarios!",1
"you either love this game or you hate it. if you like games with military tactics and guns and stuff this is the right game for you.",1
"this is a great game for anyone with experience with first person shooters. you might not want to buy this as your first fps game becasue of the steep learning curve and the amount if controls. but after some time it becomes a lot of fun. i have had a lot of good experiences in this game that i dont think i could get from another fps. it has many cool features that you just cant get from other games, like for example the ability to make use of any vehichle around you and use that as an advantage in the field. or maybe get a laser deignator off an enemy body and use that to mark targets for your friends. there is even gamemodes for roleplay. like altis life, and arma 3 life which can be fun if you like to roleplay with other people. i think the possibilities in this game are endless. you can make your own missions and submit them to the workshop for other people to download and rate, etc. i have had more than 500 hrs in this game and i think every one was a lot of fun. 10/10",3
"great for individual play and for large group play. great dlcs and many gamemodes.",1
"needs more servers and players but overall its good",1
"a great simulator of my home country, alpacastan. i appreciate the correct modelling of alpacastanians, and there wonderful law-enforced attire of blue striped shirts, hats, tan shorts, and sandals. i also love the fact that you can recreate traditional alpacastanian picnics within this great simulator. it always brings tears to my eyes to remember the death of my grandfather, backwards cap guy- he was hit by a car, and then shot by a spy during the great cleansing of stan. rip, he will be missed. 11 frolicks out of 10.",1
"great game. it starts of boring at first (well for me as i havent played arma 1 or 2) but then you get used to it and you start meeting people and coming up with tactical plans to take out an enemy base. you begin to build your own squad with your friends. there are differet game modes such as altis life where you can choose to be a cop, rebel or a civillian. you can then start a gang with your friends and start making drugs (create your own empire like heisenburg). you can basically do anything. arma 3 is such an amazing game and you will have problems with it at first but you will grasp it. you will always find something new to do with your friends. all in all i would give this game 10/10. great tactical play with realism and really throws you into the action. this is nothing like the  call of duty franchise or any other shooter this is unique.",1
"a serious game with lots of mods, so every gamer will find something for his/her taste. my favourite mode is capture the island with bennys cti mod. lead your squad of soldiers, tanks, aircraft in the battle for territory on a huge and beautiful map. even has epoch, but the old one had better construction options.",3
"saw a war movie went to play arma,saw anything related to combat or warfare went to play arma ;) one of the most addicting games and military simulation i ever played! endless mods packs,maps,mission and game modes! you can just can do there almost anything that refers to war and military simulation and even more than that,starting from making missions in the editor and playing with friend,playing on public server or even joining a clan that suits you,joining a pvp server as king of the hill,free for all or just any other pvp modes also if you feel for some role play there is also some from that as well!! as i said game of endless contact that keeps expanding and getting new thing while thats being created only by the community there are also the devs that are keep updating and making the game better. as you can see i realy recommend buying this game,worth it! :)",2
"great looking game! if military sims is your thing, this is the game for you. unfortunately its way too hardcore for me... back to batllefield with the rest of the filthy casuals.",1

"i truly enjoy this game. it is very fun. it would be better if the ai werent so strong. i swear it takes 10 shot in the head to kill one. but other than that it is great!",1

"game has good fps value, but physics like jumping off a 5 foot building could kill you. you also can die from glitching through walls and the ground and happens often and the multiplayer have some hackers and kids and physics are very not balenced like helicopters sliding down a small slope and tipping over quickly. dont forget to watch out driving too because if you so mistakenly hit a wire fence the whole car gets ruined. lastly there needs to be a option to fix the mic ingame!",1

"played this over a free access weekend, i have a high-end gaming rig so no problems there - liked what i saw. i really wanted this game, but decided to do some research before i pulled the trigger. i really wanted a game that would let me play with modern vehicles. i couldnt wait to jump in an abrams or apache or a leopard 2 or a t-90... or jump in a tunguska to try and shoot down a a-10. i had visions of massive armored battles with supporting infantry, artillery and drones oh my! all with badass graphics, and realism only a simulator can give - beyond the laughable dumbed down versions found in the likes of battlefield and cod. then i came across screenshots of what initally looked like a russian mi-28 havoc (sweet!) with... the dual contra-rotating main rotor blades of a ka-50 hokum?! apparently, arma iii, much vaunted hardcore military simulator doesnt even have real-world vehicles in it. fantasy island nations with ficitious governments to battle in i can handle. completely made-up armored vehicles, tanks and helicopters in a supposed high-end military simulator? no thanks.",1

"welcome to the future, where 30 years from now current weapons and equipment such as the matv,fennik,iwi tavor and negev,cheytac .408,m14 ebr,merkava battle tank and littlebird will still be in use with different names and no real world upcoming technologies such as power armor,airburst launchers, vtol aircraft, and infantry hud will have any presence on the battlefield what so ever. also weapons cancelled years ago such as the commanche helicopter will be readopted generations later and renamed to avoid copyright issues. enjoy a convulted control set up where in the heat of battle you will enter the steam control panel,trying to set a machinegun to auto fire will reset to semi when entering a truck or changing weapons or enjoy running over a chicken wire fence with a multi-ton truck will disable it to a halt. also enjoy advertisements in game to buy over priced dlc if you move near some of the helicopters that cost 16 usd when the devs got drunk and thought they were devs programing pay content for world of tanks or warthunder. dont buy unless you want to play the userbase made game modes suxh as wasteland,king of the hill, or breaking point, the only thing worth playing with this software.",2

(note: theres a bug that doesnt allow you to go naked) do a back flip in a chopper? get into a tank lav and go down the highway at 100km/h then hit a rock and go flying. and a lot more! who said this was a war simulator you can play this game your whole life and not need to shoot one bullet? remember men play arma! btw: lots of people wont like this game because they dont know what to play on it. find what modes you like or make your own!",3

"military sandboxing at its best. i come from the very first operation flashpoint, aka arma: cold war assault. and from that one, to arma, to arma ii and now iii, all it has been are major improvements. combat, movement, vehicles, graphics, its just keeps getting better and better. game still lacks content compared to arma ii, but its community and potention do promise. this aint cod, battlefield or payday 2. god rambo and die.",1
"ive enjoyed arma 3 since alpha and its a great game.... ive spent over 400 hours on the game and id recommend.. the only bad thing is the terrible optimazation but over all its good!",3
"an excellent soldier sim, made for the grown ups, no cod kiddies here! the game is massive, the multiplayer is extremely good, has a great mod community thanks to the stellar steam workshop and the visuals are fantastic! definately worth a buy!!",1
"i think this is the best pc game. honestly, there are so many mods. from wasteland, to breaking point, to, epoch/overpoch, to altis life, arma 3 life, battle royale, military simulation, and so much more. trust me, it is well worth your 60 dollars and will keep you entertained for a very long time. if you can get past the horrible optimisation, and get by with whatever fps you get trust me this game will keep you entertained. 10/10 would play again.",1

"i loved arma2, sepnding endless hours building missions, and adding 3rd party content. initially arma3 was the same, although it could be a bit laggy.... and then out of the blue, the audio became very broken, stuttery and utterly disjointed, and the game itself started running at 7-9 fps, whilst complaining that bacause it was modded (its not) and that i may encounter problems (i am). ive uninstalled and re-installed, and can see zero improvement - despite all settings now put to low. sorry guys, not good enough. it makes me question the value of steam, as arma2 never had any such issues, and with steam, i no longer feel in control of whats going on, and what is, or had been, loaded. very unhappy.",1

"this game is by far one of the best games that i have ever played. i payed 60.00 for it and have not regretted it since! i love this game to death but i play the mods like battle royal and altis. i recommend this game because it brings you to a new state of gaming. not only are you able to enjoy 1v1 combat or 2v2 combat u can have wars with eachother if you get the right set of people. i have enjoyed this game more than any other just because i caan basically do whatever i want to do and either evade police to get away with it or be kind and help whoever comes along! if youre loooking for a solid multiplayer game this is the one that will capture your attention more than any other. not only will you devore 300 hours of gameplay you will begin to shape your personality of gaming to become a rebel, cop, or savior. love live the x-generation!",2
"this might not be your game if the only fps you play start with battlefield or call, unless you only play on hardcore modes. if you like military sims, then this is the quintessential experience. you can devote endless hours playing this game with nearly endless options. bi supports its modding community and it is very expansive. they also occassionally have cash prizes for mods. unfortunately the modding community isnt well represented in steam workshop, but downloading mods from bis forums isnt difficult. there are some intuitive control issues with the ui, but its forgivable. i wish i had more time to give this game so i could join a group that plays regularly, like shacktac.",1
"worst than dayz standalone .game always crash for no reason",2
"amazing. graphics are very realistic. the game play itself will be hard to grasp at first however after you have gotten the hang of it, it can indeed be very rewarding as well as realistic. overall in general i would recommend arma to anyone who wants a true sandbox playground to engage in different military situations and other community made missions.",2
"i love this game. i transport drugs and sell this for money to buy more drugs :d",1

"very fun game to play. definitely recommend to everyone.",1
"one of my all time favorites. game has come a long way from operation flashpoint and it doesnt disappoint.",4
"this game is pretty epic and i would recommend this to anyone who has time on their hands and who like playing shooters with strategic gameplay. however, do not buy this, or waste time buying this if you dont have an intel cpu. this game destroys your cpu if its anything other than intel, and if you proceed with this, you will suffer. just make sure you have a good gpu aswell. i have an amd cpu and a r9 280 x toxic, and it runs fine in single player (50-60 fps with everything maxed, distance tweaked a bit), but its terrible with online multiplayer, not the rendering part, or the calculations made by the cpu in normal battles, but if someone decides to use any sort of explosives, my computer laggs the f- out. again, dont buy unless you have an intel (4th gen ofcourse)",2

"this is a amazing game. going from playing arma 2 and arma 2: operation arrowhead is a brand new experiance. this game has amazing graphics and amazing gameplay. the only thing i miss is when diplomacy fails from arma 2 where you and some ai fight against another army and you have to control different locations to win. but overall this game was worth the upgrade.",1
"this game needs tons of work, and a new editor mode that allows you to make decently good maps that will catch an eye of a random player, but the updates are monthly just keep praying for better updates. also  all of the script hackers, you cant get banned from vac if your a script hacker in arma 3, its sad to see a half full server have to restart and still have te scriptor in the server after guesses who it is.",1
"what more can i say about arma 3 besides the fact that its by far the best military sim there is. period.",1
"the best game !.. ever ..! the best money ive spent on steam and its all worth it. =) out of 5 stars i can give arma 3",3
"arma 3 is vary fun yet demanding game, if you have the hard ware for this game i would recommend it but if you dont, dont even think about it. i fyou like milsim this may be the game for you, their are a lot of good milsim groups that play this game and they have fun doing it, there are tons of mods to make this game so much better than it already is.",4
"i have to say that this is probably my favorite game of all time. im able to spend countless hours in arma iii and still have a great time doing so. there are gamemodes that everyone will enjoy and support for modding is pretty good as well. i would rate this game a 9/10 for its awesome action packed gameplay. while on mission there is hardly ever a time when im not on edge being aware that the enemy may be anywhere. whether you want to play arma iii as tatically as possible in a video game, you can. if you want to just play casually and shoot some bad guys cause its fun.... go right ahead you can do that too. i overall just love the game and play it mostly multiplayer because although the campaign is great multiplayer is where its really at!",1
"this game has awesome graphics but takes a good computer to run them. at ultra settings this game looks amazing. it is a very fun and time consuming game.",1
"the arma series is the best by far. in my opinion no game can top it for simulation or realism. arma 3 could do better tho. (no offence)... ... ... as it says in the description experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox.... i would love to have arma 3 go a little bit more into detail with some aspects of the game. but becides that it is amazing. i would recommend this game to anyone who like military games. if ur a cod or battlefeild (which i am but not as much as arma 3) fan watch out because arma 3 is the next big thing. > profile name <, game on!",3

"first off i havent played enough of this game to write a full review i just want to shout out to all the people tempted by this game in the sale. this game is amaziing, or atleast what ive played of it so far. i loved arma 2 but it felt a little bit stale compared to this game. the world and charicters just feel that little bit more real which really help the immersition of a game like this. music is good and can really build tenstion when needed and hype you up for the big fight upcoming. i would highly recomend this game to anyone intrested in both fps and stratagy fans. i would also recommend it to people who are intrested in warfair in generall. you will not be disapointed ! (full review in an update once ive clocked in enough hours in this very indepth combat simulater)",1
"if you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. if you dont have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. if you dont have the game to play, get the money for it. if you dont have the money for it, get a job. if you dont have a job, rob the bank. if you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.",1
"i have played this game for a long time and have also played arma 2. i would call this game one of the best games out there. there is so many things that you can do that it just does not end. if you are looking for a new game to buy i would say arma 3 is a great chose.",3

"no, this is in no way better than call of duty, i feel cheated with this game, its too hard and endlessly complex.",1
"played it for 2 hours during the free weekend! it was amazing! i was speechless at the graphics of the terrain, they were simply unbelievable! i was playing it on my new laptop and i was running easily above 40fps!!! i wish i could buy it but sadly i got no money left from my laptop :( the people playing it we great and supportive. it was slightly harder to handle driving at first but after 20 minutes it was easy! if you are thinking about buying this game and have the money, dont think!!!!!! just buy it :d !!!",3
"alot of fun especially when you start playing modded servers.",1
"i almost feel like steam played a crule joke on me . i payed $40 for the game and it doesnt work arma 3 has the worst fps in history , my pc runs it @ 9 fps . what a joke . do yourself a favor and buy anything else . . .",1
"they added bipods and upnp how can it not get a thumbs up now",3
"awesome multiplayer game, but not always very good optimized.",1
"it could use some more content and an introduction to modding without having to go through endless forum threads, but its a pretty solid game... probably the most fun game ive ever played. once you get past the learning curve, its really an amazing experience.",2

"very good game, extremly good graphic, sound, everything! some little bugs but nah, they will be solved i think, i recommand!",1

"arma iii is a exciting firstperson/thirdperson military simulation game. it has so much value. but, arma iii, in the end.... doesnt have enough. i love its features, gameplay, all of that. but, theres three things arma iii needs, more vehicles, more weapons, and more maps. let me explain. arma ii, standalone. arma ii, without any dlc, has such a great amount of content, it surpases arma iii, and then, with the addition of dlcs such as operation arrowhead, czech republic, etc. my question is, is there more to come for arma iii? now, this game is worth every penny. but i feel that arma iii needs its own complete expansions like arma ii had. i promise you, this game will not disapoint. but, i just feel that compared to arma ii, this game is so much smaller.",2
"dayz breaking point mod amd koth is bae with a group of 2-5 competent friends who can get over the steep learning curve and unforgiving deaths. but with all that nonsense you get loot and you can kill people and establish houses and territories. very sandbox mil-sim game 9.75/10 (add more to breaking poing mod)",2

"i would recommend this game because this game has lots of mods with it and its really funny.",1
"realistic. and sometimes not realistic, but its a simulator so whatd you expect. go kill a bunch of people and make a ton of money racking up your war crimes only to realize hours later none of it was real. kinda like playing a game all day huh?",3
"this might be the coolest game ive ever seen. the possabilities are endless with the mission editor.",2
"this game is so much fun. dont buy if you have below a dual core though, you wont be able to run it well at all. i have a dual core and play it fine though, no lag or anything. this game is as close as it gets to real life and actually required skill, planning, and patience unlike any other fps on the market. if you are looking for the best fps/military simulator look no further. youve found it. its arma 3. 11/10 great game",2
"liek 10/10 - ign m8 you will not even know what is happening but den you step on a explosive and die. 10/10",2
"this game is sick, i am not amused when i am playing this game. its boring. i dont really know how people still have fun with this game. in multiplayer there is so few kind of mods. it has a lot of lag.. and its hard to play good in multiplayer. you can play for some days, but soon, you might be tired of this game. i am repent to buy this game",1
"outstanding game, many many hours of fun! the large support of built-in mods, and friends make this game a serious winner. intel fans will love this game, amd processor fans.... not so much. personal experience is that my i7 2600k had a good 30% increase in frames compared to my fx-8350, same graphics cards and memory amount + memory speed.",1
"awesome war simulator!! multiplayer is the best when you are on a server with a group of people that want to play seriously, if not it can be a bummer. single player is fun as well as it can become more of a fps than a simulator. i call this game a simulator over fps because if you try to play it as a point and shoot game you will die in the first 10 minutes. highly recomend!!!",1
"arma 3 is an amazing military sim, with lots of different gamemodes so the game never gets boring. very fun to join up with your friends, recomend sandbox mode, altis life, and king of the hill. i heard battleroyal is really fun but never got to play it yet, if your looking for an intense shooter i recomend purchasing this game even at the 60$ price point!!!",1
"can do backflips in helicopters leading to an atv slingshot. 10/10 best military simulator",1
"it calls itself a realistic simulator game and it is. -great graphics -good campaign missions (scenarios or showcases) -full sandbox mode -multiplayer -wonds affect the player one bad thing is you will never stop looking at the control menu for the first few hours until you figure out what keys you will be using.",1
"great game if you enjoyed playing any of the other arma series. already has life mods, and dayz mods available to play on. expect some similar to arma 2 bugs/quirks but nothing really game breaking in my opinion. a lot of the issues that comes with the multiplayer gameplay is usually server-side more than client-side issues, which even at that point i have not seen many bad servers. multiplayer is fun, steam workshop integration is awesome as well!",1
"i pre-purchased this game before it even came out and here i am nearly two years later and this game is just terrible... arma 2: oa is much better. arma 3 is not terrible neccesarily becuase of the gameplay, i want to add its terrible becuase it just runs absolutly horrible on my computer for some reason i have no idea why... i can never get above 25 fps.... i have an amd fx cpu (8 cores @ 4.0 ghz) and an nvidia gtx 770 gpu... why does this game run so horribly bad?? dont tell me its cause i have an amd processor because that is not a valid excuse. even 2 years later this game is $60 and another $16 if you want two extra helicopters? its ridiculous! this game had potential to be a great successor to arma 2 but it just falls so short it isnt as fun, its runs terribly so i just cannot recomment it to anyone. another side note, i dont know if this is because of the low quality settings i have to use...but, the sky always seems like it is soo bright and washes out detials so bad arma 3 just look terrible. im so very disapointed in this game.",1
"seems like a fantastic sim, and for people who like sims, i could see the appeal. but i struggle to find the fun in the game. i was really terrible at it which makes this review biased. the reason i dont recommend it is because i dont think the average guy would have fun playing, so why drop the 60$ unless you like a realistic and challenging war sim. i rage quit within an hour.",1
"following on from arma 2 alot to improve and fix, but still a good game.",4
"the most realistic first person shooter game i have ever played and with it comes a very mature community of players.",1
"as buggy as the beta still is (as youd expect), this game has been more fun and engaging than any other new game ive played in the past 3-5 years. i almost never get to say this, but i am actually looking forward to the full release.",2
"i cant play arma 3. its the arma 3 free weekend and its telling me to purchase the game. can someone please help me?",1
"this game is awesome. all of the content that comes with the game is great, and there is a lot more to download off of the internet that adds even more to the game. it really does so much right.",2
"the cluster shells are amazing. made a flaming car hit a guy.",1
"the best installment of the arma series so far. laggy gameplay seems to have been fixed to the great extent, interesting and intensive, dramatic single player campaign reminds the original operation flashpoint times. recommended for all tactical warfare simulation fans.",1
"the graphics and lighting on this game are amazingly well done. car headlights actually shine off things like real life, and the sunsets are beautiful. unfortunately, the physics are little more than ragdoll, and the vehicle handling feels like your wheels are actually ice skates and the road is an ice rink. the campaign is pretty boring - the storyline isnt anything special (but to be completely honest, i didnt play much more than 15 minutes since the first level is so damn dull). multiplayer is decent, with life rpg servers dominating the server list. altis life is fun for 4-5 hours, until you realise that theres 5 cars and 10 guns, and money takes the piss to earn because you always get arrested or shot by police/terrorists/annoying  civilians. if you try to join any other servers, especially the ones that have a mission which requires teamwork, you will be very disappointed. the majority of the arma 3 playerbase is now <13 years old (and none of them know how to play as a team - they all want the glory of a kill) thanks to the attention dayz drew to this series of games. overall though, i have to say its an ok game. i dont think the game is worth 35. i also think that the battleye anticheat is . other than that, you will probably enjoy it for a few days at least.",1
"arma is a game that absolutely demands that one play multiplayer. bear that in mind before you buy it because singleplayer is absolutely not this games focus.",2
"simulator that only one in the earth that satisfied graphics, reality",5
"massive improvement since the last game which ive been playing for about 4 years.",1
"this arma 3 is i think the best war sim out on any platform yeah battlefield is cool and good but the scale and detail in this game is amazing and it gets better with every update and with the community workshop, it opens up the game to never ending ideas with the in game editor, and the new zeus addition to the game makes it even better and dont forget the mods. i love this game.",2
"great military simulator. one of the best i have ever played. recommend it if you want to be challenged!",2
"so much mods available, almost too much to choose from.",1
"arma 3 is a great game if you like real shooters you will like this game 10/10",5
"arma iii is a very comprehensive and realistic tactical shooter, its a must have for everyone who has arma ii and gamers who love tactical shooters. the graphics are magnificent, i love the vehicles and the variety of guns. 8/10, you need to buy this game if you enjoyed arma ii as much as i did!",1
"pretty sweet game, 10/10 would consistantly play again.",1
"opposing ai is smart. friendly ai is dumb. modding saved this game at the start. hopefully the devs continue to release quality work and fix their issues.",2
"its . dont play. bernie impulse bought and hates it. every second he has played got him closer to commititing suduko",1
"too good, the graphics, gameplay and scenery look and feel real. its scary when your shot at and exciting when you fly. the best game of 2013! :d edit: however with the new campaign addons i have noticed that there has been a drop of fps in the mulltiplayer section making it unplayable",1
"awesome game! very fun and well thought out. the big arsenal of mods makes it endlessly more fun to play! 10/10 would play again.",3
"having played this game a lot, ive decided to give it extremely possitive feedback, and i need to review a game to get an award.. so .. this game is really good for people who like to mix fun with realism. 9/10 due to the physics being a bit dodgy ie falling and dying off of a 1m stair case.. but overall a great game filled with a lot of hard effort from the devs",2
"this game is reallyyyy funnn. there is loads of gamemodes and a great community. (but prepare for bad optimization and bugs.)",1
"tbh this game is 2 good 4 me i have to take time to remind myself that this game is a game and not irl",2

"the closest youll ever get to real combat in a video game. be prepared for slow paced gameplay compared to other shooters (because thats how it is in real life). once past the initial learning curve, arma 3 provides some of the most rewarding gameplay out there. community mods increase this games value tenfold.",1
"if youre looking at this game, youve probably played arma ii. if you havent, you should start there. i was introduced into this series when i bought this + the arrowhead expansion for dayz mod. boy, did i love arma ii. it was just good, though the arrowhead expansion blasted the main arma ii out of the water with better controls and graphics. arma iii flows even smoother. its an extremely fun game to play, and the sandbox is very fun once you grasp at least the basic amount of control to it. however, arma iii is still a military simulator so dont expect to just quickscope through the game. you will spend a weekend learning the controls, and you will hate it until it clicks. only then will it click, and youll begin to apreciate all the work the devs put into the game. so again, try arma ii first to at least see if you like the concept. otherwise, arma iii is a major improvement of an already goooood series.",1
"very good game and sequel to arma 2. multiplayer is quite fun but also quite difficult for some newbies out there to online shooters. but to the more experienced hand this game is a must have. 10/10",4
"i love the game. 7/10. but there is one thing you have to understand: multiplayer isnt like dayz or anything like that. you have to complete a mission. like co-op. i bought the game thinking it was like a war version of dayz. the campain is amazing. buy the game if you pick up on things easy. you kind of have to play the game for a while to understand alot of things.",1
"walk-simulator...but if you have a couple of friends for coop it is fun i loved the old operation flashpoints games. you could save when you want, now with arma iii you cant, that makes replaying missions so annyoing, walking everytime like 5 minutes, again and again... also the peformence is terrible, you have to make the game very ugly to play it fluent on modern systems. please go back to your roots developer! about the multiplayer i cant say much, people banning you for no reason, but i like the coop if you find nice peoeple. on the good side, the controls improved very much, but i dont get the point of people saying it is a simulation if you cant even release your bipod...even in the arcade game battlefield 3/4 you can release your bipod... also the enemies can see through plants/threes and on. on sale you can have fun with it, but i would not buy this for a full price.",1
"while i cant say i played a lot of this game, i must say that i can tell it isnt my cup of tea. i wanted to see if my love for complex war simulators like the paradox game translated well into fpses but i find i prefer faster-pace and unrealistic fpses like counter-strike.",1
"amazing game. i used to love the socom franchise (1-combined assault) and but wanted them to go in a different direction than they did. when i found the arma series of games i was amazed at the depth and the realism involved. i will buy any arma game released as long as they stay on par with what they are doing and improve where it is needed. amd fx 6300, geforce gtx 760, 8gb ram runs great at custom/ max settings",1
"a better looking version of arma 2 with little about that game fixed. steep learning curve. better tutorial this time. ai has aim hacks. you will watch as your team cant hit the broad side of a barn while the enemy ai can nail you with one bullet from 1500 yards. too frustrating to really continue with campaign.",1
"fun game, i find it better when playing with other people",1
"i recomend this game to others, but i hope there will be more weekends where this will be for free or 50% off or more.",1
"after trying it during the free weekend i can say this is definitely worth buying, id get it for myself, but my pc specs dont allow me to play on servers that are highly populated (80+ people). good community and many different type gamemodes (also the breaking point mod) make it worthwhile.",1
"this game should be free i think people who made this game wants money so much that he made this game cost",1
"solid game with plenty of mods and missions to complete! tries a little to hard to do everything",5
"idk it says to whrite a review sooo and i dont have the game soo wtf",1
"arma iii is a military sandbox objective based multiplayer game. now lets start with the + -big maps (about 250 square km) -weapon variety anything from pistols to lmg and caliber 50 rifles. -loads of armored trucks, helicopters and air planes. -character customization. anything from undershirt to helmets and armor vest. -excellent graphics. it looks stunning on ultra. now its time for the - -horrible fps(frames per second) which results in multiplayer sometimes becomes a frustrating chore. if you get above 20fps consider yourself lucky. -there is no introduction to the controls what so ever, and it takes a lot of time to learn all the moves. -the base player community is sometimes a hellhole to be a part of. -moving and dying animations can look awful at times. especially the dying animation. presentation: 2.0 graphics: 9.0 sound: 7.0 game-play: 8.0 lasting appeal: 7.5 overall rating: 8.0 now arma iii is a fun fps/third person tactical shooter but it needs a lot more work to be worth the current price of 44.99 euros.",1
"ing sucks, forget finding a altis life sever, or finding someone to help you.",1
"was awsome game. was. thats the big word everytime i go to launch the game now it says initializing then crashes had this for couple months now no support at all from bistudios or any resolved solution from other forums it it worked more often i would recommend it",1
"this game is just so awesome. since its a military simulation sandbox, even the campaign missions are very diverse, fun and ramdom. although it has a script, anything can happen. its just so much fun! and the graphics are amazing! 10/10",1
"this is the greatest tactical game ive played other games in this genre none of them can compete with arma 3s huge map and amazing graphics while having amazing gameplay.",1
"great realism and lots of co-op action available for the most fun experience. though the engine is poor so you cant really get more the 50 fps. but i tend to pull through it and have fun!",5
"feels like im having muslims up my . i love it! ps. i love you all.",3
"love this game. love it how it is set and everything!",1
"awsome i been playing on the free weekends its come out i dont see anty thing wrong with it",1
"pretty basic until you get mods for it. find a good community of gamers who game regularly and with good mods and this becomes one of the best games youll ever buy. im going to fail my degree because of this game. 10/10",4
"this game is truly awesome 1 trillon/10 :) definatly buy it",2

"reasons to play arma3: arma rp servers altislife etc battleroyale epoch, breakingpoint etc crashed my truck full of cocaine in a random location in the middle of nowhere next to nothing, thought all my work was wasted, then out of nowhere a dude runs out of a bush, repairs my car, i tell him, i have no money with me, but i have coke, gave him a bit, and he ran away in a random direction 10/10 would crash my car again",1
"arma 3 is the best military simulation game ive ever played. it incorporates all elements of warfare into one massive map for the ultimate realistic experience.",5
"this game is really good and the mods are getting better and better :)",1
"could use better car graphics, but other than that, pretty sick.",1
"i absolutly love this game though i have a bad pc and this game is very demanding (my pc runs at 10-30 fps with low settings) it is still very fun",1
"absolutly amazing for team play. great tactical game... expecially with friends.",2
"very good, very hard, very.... laggy at times. arma 3 is great, its fun tactical and all that good stuff. the community made content is fantastic and the multiplayer is great if you find a decent enough server. however it does carry over quite a few problems from its previous installments, some of these incluce -extreme difficulty navigating buildings due to weird responsiveness of controls -nearly all of the building are unfournised -too much wasteland servers -a lot of mp servers are laggy as hell -vehicles made out of ing paper that aside, its still the best shooter i have played as of yet.",2
"only not happy about this game due to the fact that the digital delux edition does not have any dlcs with it... sigh kind of gay, but sort of my fault... but yes now i am buying the rest of the dlcs",1
"experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox. deploying a wide variety of single- and multiplayer content, over 20 vehicles and 40 weapons, and limitless opportunities for content creation, the pcs premier military game series is back. authentic, diverse, open - arma 3 sends you to war.",1
"a terribly optimized game. if you dont have a good computer i would not recomend buying this game.that and its a peice of . other then that the only pro is the mods",1
"awesome fun if you have friends to play with and you are able to run it smoothly.",2
"arma 3...... well not much to say really it is a very good game. definetly worth buying. only if you have a beefy pc though!!!!",1
"its simple there is just nothing quite as rewarding as arma 3 in the video game industry. i mean sure its learning curb is hard to get around but the benifits much outweigh the negatives. great game 9.5 /10 must buy",1
"easily the best small island simulator ive ever played. loads of trees and flies!!!",1
"great game, some good missions on the steam workshop to keep this playing.",1
"altis life sucks and its so hard to run its stupid",1
"its arma. if youve played arma 2 you know what your getting.",1
"i mean if you want a military simulator this is ok but arma 2 is where its at",1
"there is so much content to enjoy in arma 3-from cooperative missions to battle royale to wasteland. i guarantee youll be spending hours playing through it all. the experience becomes even better if you have friends to play with. even though the single player isnt very enjoyable, its a huge leap from that of arma 2. if you can catch arma 3 on sale, i definitely recommend you buy it.",1
"the best game out of the arma series so far! i have played around 106 hours of arma 3 so far so you could say im a beginner. i was not a big fan of arma 2 but this one is phenomenal. graphics are amazing. this game will give you with an adrenaline rush every time you play! worth every penny. if you dont have it buy it now!",5
"i bought the extened edition on another account then sent the extended edition to this account. i did not recieve any of the current dlcs with it only karts. game is great just has flaws to things like the $15 dlc packs. come on bohemia youre not ea stop being money hungry.",1
"if you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. if you dont have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. if you dont have the game to play, get the money for it. if you dont have the money for it, get a job. if you dont have a job, rob the bank. if you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.",1
"this game is great... although the mods are much better then the vanilla arma 3.. try them all. i recommend breaking point.. recently won 4th mod of the year 2014, and was the only arma mod in the top 10. its amazing.. the game is great but the modding makes it fabulous! good luck, have fun, dont read the bad reviews.. and get it now! there is alot of bambis on the bad reviews!",3
"really fun to play with friends, 10/10 from me on how realistic the shooting is.",1
"the campaign, scenarios and mods are fun and enjoyable. the multiplayer is unplayable compared to most games, though. even some of the best pcs barely get 20fps on some servers. its a known issue with the game and steam should warn buyers who intend to play multiplayer heavily. if you think youd enjoy a war sim in singleplayer then check out this game. if your pc is good and can run this game on high, it looks beautiful. not to mention there are plently of mods that continue to come out. hopefully the mp becomes more stable fps wise through future updates, if possible.",1
"the dlc policy of todays game developers is the worst possible thing that might ever come. arma 3 has limited content, but guess what? if you pay extra, you get extra content. why sell full game once, when you can divide it into pieces and sell in parts? i do not recommend.",1
"arma 3 is an absolutely fantastic game. the world feels natural and the situations you face in the campaign modes make you feel helpless and more like a regular guy, then a call of duty bullet sponge. the only thing you should keep in mind however, (and by far the worst thing about this game) is its absolutely terrible optimization. to get a stable 30 fps average, you will need a beast of a computer. radeon 270s and their competitors wont be cutting it for this game.",1
"the thinking mans shooter. also hilarious physics glitches and one of the most active and diverse modding communities out there. if you like shooting things, but dont have the reflexes for cs anymore, get this. its amazing!",1
"really im not sure how i feel about this game. when its fun its a blast.... when its not fun youre wandering across the countryside alone with nothing to do. like other similar games things can go from notmalto chaotic in seconds and some great things happen. in those moments this game really shines. other times its boring as hell.",1
"best army simulator game nowadays. many mods, much fun.",1
"really fun, a bit buggy, but not liike dayz buggy.",1
"this game is absolutely beautiful, i would recommend it to everyone who is interested in a realistic shooter! a massive step up from arma 2",1
"it is was good game it is nice and you have to try it it is good big map and tankis evrthing",1
"played this game... kinda liked it... kinda liked its mom... 10/10 would recommend.",1
"arma 3 is the best simulator out yet!!! recomended for everyone:d",5
"very realistic military simulation! so if you like it a little complicated but realistic i can only recommend this game. for me the key thing was the multiplayer its so much fun.",2
"arma 3 is starting to look like a pay to win game the last dlc:arma 3 helicopters is not supposed too be dlc this game is far from finished. this is really just an update. i predict that there also will be an apc dlc, assault boat dlc, jets dlc and maybe even a weapons dlc. bohemia is not the same as in arma 2, their morals changed into moneywhoring of the dayz trend. i see this and hope that more people notice this (unacceptable) payed update trend. bohemia please, i paid 50 euros for your game i personally think this is enough for what we get. after being banned in the beta version that i bought we were promised more vehicles (notice: not as in dlc.) we currently have, and the game is finished a few similar weapons and vehicles. i am still waiting for these promised features of the finished product. jan koning,",1
"the arsenal has made the game better by letting you import your own loadouts through zeus",1
"continuing the open world tactical shooter tradition, arma iii lives up to expectations. not much else to say, go watch a few videos.",1
"nothing on earth can run this game. what i can do, however, is enjoyable.",1
"its fairly rare for me to write recommendations in general, and its even rarer for me to find a game that ill keep coming back to after the 100 hour mark. arma 3 is definitely one of those games. im in no way saying its finished mind you. there are some occasional bugs, and sometimes the ai is really  or has laser rifles that pistol kill you from 1000m away (not so frequent anymore) but for what it offers, and what can be added via mods, this is one of my all time favorite games. if you have even one friend playing with you, youll have hours of fun. its really unbelievable how much you can do, and how much you keep coming back for even after frustrating encounters or missions. theres something for everybody in arma 3 (theres even a fishing mod for all you nonviolent pansies.) and it really provides a framework for you to do what you want with it. in all honesty, i am hard pressed to name a game that allows you the ease of introduction and ramps up to advanced techniques so smoothly. the more you play, the better you get (obviously) and ultimately, you decide how and what you want to play. the game goes on sale occasionally, so id wait til then, although i bought it full price and never looked back. its one of the very few unfinished games that i dont regret buying.",2
"this game though, i only suggest getting it if you have a larger computer with more space and such, if youre struggling with combat just either do the virtual reality training or play on wasteland servers, so easy to get geared.",1
"awesome game , big improvment from arma 2, much better graphics, runs better even on my dated machine,better guns , better maps ,feels smoother ,great mods for it. altis life: lots of played interaction (not allways dm). do all manner of stuff to get money.be a drug runner, a bandit holding people up, delivery missions, farm materials, rob banks and federal reserve,be a car theif . spend on guns, cars, choppers, various licenses,become a rebal with access to naughty illigal fire power and cars, most fun iv had playing this mod has been trolling police , getting into car chases , shooting them in the face and taking their stuff or just generaly pissing them off, not played as a cop yet apart from steeling their cars and pretending to be one .. wasteland: its like battlefield on a massive scale and more in depth. farm for your guns ,cars and supplies, team up or not , make bases. can be really fast paced like battlefield or on larger maps you may need to go find the action. but it now , i heard they gunna run out of copies soon ><",2
"guy crashed in my car thought i was going to be totaled in battle royale his ar blew up instead god bless amurica!!!!!!!!",1
"arma is such an amazing franchise, and arma 3 is no exeption. the game got over 40 weapons, but with different weapons for each faction, where two is very similar. in arma 2 there was alot of mods, like dayz or invasion 1944 but in arma 3 they added intigration with the steam workshop, which makes modding really easy. overall the game is amazing and definitly worth getting, and i would give it a 8/10 with the only downside being what i feel as too few weapons.",1
"if by chance you are fortunate to be right-handed, use default controls at all times, dont mind that even this comes with several impairing elements, dont mind tons of glitches and unstable content, dont mind wading through to find actual significant content yourself or want to put in dozens of hours of effort to make content in a steep and vague learning curve...then this game is the best a military simulation can do for now.",1
"this game is fun , but mostley for the mods and other multiplayer",1
"its a pretty hard game at least if you havent played these before but when you get there its awesome! you will get the most of it when you play with a group of friends. since there is so many mods there will be something to play for everyone no matter what you like. definetly would recommend this to someone who likes realistic wargames.",1
"completely unpolished game with an engine that runs poorly. expect crashes often and low fps on even the best rigs. down right terrible execution of a game/idea.",1
"much better than call of duty and battlefield. this game does a very great job in immersing you into the environment. your team a.i. can get killed leaving you the only one left in the squad. the bullets snap and whiz around you. there are many choices of vehicles to choose from all with different roles and abilities. kinda wish there were more guns thats just my opinion but the fewer choices bring simplicity in the game. the underwater subs and scuba suits are also very awesome, totally wished they had sharks that would bring some thrills. also the graphics over all are sexy all over, pleasing your eyes with ic glee.",1
"as a fan of the arma series, its no surprise that i would love this entry in the series. combat is intense, with bullets and missiles whizzing past my head every living minute. as for the campaign, it is pretty well made, as you struggle to survive the onslaught of csat forces on altis. multiplayer is beautiful, whether it be competitive or cooperative. and finally, the huge modding community you can find on armaholic or the steam workship. if you have the money, buy the game. it is very much worth it!",4
"tyre popping simulator 2015 0 tyres / 10 - would pop again.",1
"i really love this game. there is some glitches though not that much and is very fun to play with friends or teamamates. there are things like role-playing servers where you have to act just like you act in life and another is wasteland which is just trying tu survive. you need to find your stuff and survive, i really like this game and i could play it for days striaght without stopping because its just so fun. add me as a friend and we could play arma 3 sometime , i am always on :)",3
"my buddy and i blew up a tank, repaired it, drove into a heavily guarded enemy base, killed everything, stole a chopper and left grand theft auto: stratis",1
"as an army game its lacking, as a game with untold potential its fantastic. this isnt just an army game. when you buy this game you buy a sandbox with unlimited user created content along with endless possibilities. in my opinion this game is worth the money. i havent even scratched the surface of this game and im already hooked.",1
"amazing game good for pc gamers , fun and liitle bugs here and then but overall good game .",1
"very fun game if you like real war games or an rpg game play altlis life recomend devils dog round up sever or dmm or war game mode",2
"game is all well and good. but i really hate the fact that they put the game this far in the future! the weapons are absolute crap! im shocked that they didnt just say to hell with it and give you ing lazer guns. i love the addition of scuba options and implementing body armor and customizing your own outfit and the campaign is interesting plus voice acting is much better than arma 2. id give this a 6 out of 10 because i am not happy that i am gonna have to download a  load of mods to play the game with equipment and vehicles that should of been implemented in the first place.",1
"i got arrested because matt drove into the police car. 69/10",2
"this is the best military sim i have ever played it is very fun way better then cod or battlefield",1
"its a really nice game if you are into realistic shooters, but somethings i personally dont like is the maps are horrible if you can compare it to chernorous or takistan, and the map is one of the most important things in this game(mp). the last thing thats negative is when you play on 60+ servers, it tends to have an awefoul dsync problem and kills all the fun you could have in the game. otherwise this game is exstreamly good and the stuff i mention is going to fade away over time. sorry about my english typoes.",1
"great combat simulator. but only get it if you have a beefy computer.",1
"this game is not for fans of call of duty or any simple fps. when it says it is a realistic military simulator, they mean it. the controls are amazing, things like moving your head (not your body) orthe many stance options.",1

"if you like realistic war game, then arma 3 is what your are looking for. :)",1
"i think this game is a great military sim.it combines teamwork with tactics and mixes it up with mods and good bots that will give you a run for your money.now ive only played this for the free weekend so i cant give you a super good reveiw but i will say that from what me and my brother played that this game is vary fun and challenging game and we will definetly buy it in the upcomeing days",1
"waste of money, game is pointless if you want to play the actual game (no mods)...",1
"a very fun game if you can find the right people to play with, you can do missions like battle royale, wasteland, altis or maybe stratis life idk do what you want. 150 hours means its over 10 stars. its outstanding the graphics somewhat the physics bohemia interactive yet have to figure out the physics other than that buy it.",3
"for an alpha this gives us a short but sweet insight visa what to expect in armas future. and the future is bright. decent performance, beautiful islands (only 1 included in this alpha), many improvements in movement, weapon systems and physics and best of all searchlights on helios that work!. and look sweet! that first moment when you look up at a lighthouse in the night and see those beams of light piecing the darkness youll know that arma should have a decent future when finally released. best of all, if you buy the alpha itll automatically upgrade to the beta and then the retail release for no extra cost! just dont forget to report those bugs eh? (the alpha is still buggy, has some ai issues and balancing issues. it is also short of content. do not expect a campaign or full featured game until release)",1
"do not buy this cash grab. bohemia refuses to fix their multiplayer performance issues after this long? the game is practically unplayable on multiplayer, even with an i7 4770k and 2x gtx 780 ti. complete garbage, never ever buy a game from bohemia interactive again.",1
"in the same theme as carlsberg lager being probably the best lager in the world.... arma 3. probably the best mil sim in the world. superb in game graphics, excellent replayability, user creation mode is fantastic. more than enough mods are available, workshop for the user created missions, if you cant design your own. one major drawback to it... it requires high-spec machinery to run satisfactory. if you really want this though, sort your machine out, then spend a little cash on this game. its the most realistic military simulator ever. so damned good, it makes my balls tingle!",3

"its a very good game to play with your friends but if you want to play something like rping then try altis thats something that is fun to do. plus you can be a cop, medic or a civilian!",1
"this game is absolutely ridiculous in the fact that there is so much more to this game than shooting and killing. i was sick and tired of the neverending onslaught that is call of duty and battlefield. while i see both of those as fun in a fast paced competitive environment, i wanted to find a shooter that had more of a roleplay aspect to it. arma 3 is exactly what i was looking for. you cant just run out in the open and expect 360 across the map headshots while hipfiring with an smg (one the maps are huge and two bullet drop). cover can keep you alive while in a deadly firefight and can keep you alive while your buddy tries to save you with his gunship he stole from an enemy base. also, there is a free movement camera by holding the alt key which changes the fixed camera in typical first person shooters. you can be running into a forest while looking to your right and you might notice an enemy patrol and can drop to cover before they notice you. and then theres the mods. there are so many different mods to make the game sound and look better and modded game modes that add even further role play in the game. i spent about 80 hours in one week addicted to one of those game modes and ended up missing a few days of school because i was sucked in. this game is best when playing with friends!!!",1
"arma 3 is the perfect military simulator for any sort of tactical training. bullet drop physics are nice, could have wind resistance added however.",1
"love this series. theres a lot to mod, and the learning curve is ridiculous-- but well worth it.",1
"great game nice and tacticle but takes up hours of time if you want to have a quick game not to great but super much fun and socks up the hours like nothing before.",1
"-spends 45 minutes looking for battle royale server -joins one -waits 30 minutes for game to start -game starts. runs frantically to nearest house -finds gun without ammo, hides in forest -finds another house -finds another gun with ammo -finds polo shirt and khaki shorts, puts them on -looks on map for player icon -error 404: player icon not found -gets shot in face while checking map 10/10 would wait again",1
"the epitome of military simulation. hone your skills then apply to an online community for some of the most immersive military gaming imaginable!",1

"great game way better then arma 2. i played over 300 hours of arma 3 and still enjoy it.",5
"this game is worth buying just for battle royale alone. the controls are a little awkward, but with a bit of rebinding, youll be just fine.",1
"hello arma i will just go streight on and say its a good game worth evry penny of the money they ask for .",1
"this game,in my opinion is awesome,i havent played for such a long time to be honest,however,lots of things had already happend,talking about the game modes,the one i like most,is battle royale,this is just so amazing,altis file is also a pretty good one,at first it was so boring,but in the long run,so many things happened in such a short time its alo pretty good to play with friends...to sum up,i loved the game!",1
"the best simulator and its called arma! literally the best game ive ever played",1
"i have never played this game but steam still wanted me to write a review. i give this game a 00",1
"1. play wasteland 2. die at spawn for a few hours 3. finally get away from spawn to find a good weapon and some cash 4. die 5. repeat steps 1-3 6. find a vehicle and camp a gun store and be one of the guys that killed you after step 3. real talk though, great game to play with friends if you want to laugh and get weak as . (battle royale is a fun game type too) 11/10 favorite shooter",1
"very fun to use. the graphics and realism aspect of the game is extreme. the firefights are intense, and its easy to be immersed into the combat. the vehicle (including aircraft, submarines, helicopters) interiors are nice to look at as well. zues: before this addon i couldnt get up close to watch a firefight without getting shot. this makes a great rts, and a pleasurable theater of war. go karts: i was kind of confused about this addon. a war simulator with go karts? i got it, tried it out, and to be honest it wasnt that bad. bohemia interactive was trying something new. it was apreciated.",1
"great visual effects, a stunningly immense map with detailed environments and immersive gameplay, arma 3 is one of (if not the best) military simulators currently available. casual gamers beware, the name of the game in arma is realism and bohemia interactive has spared no attention to detail. arma is merciless, running and gunning into an enemy squad will get you killed in two seconds flat. alertness, caution, cover, strategy and teamwork will win the day. strongly recommended for the more serious fps players and those wanting a truly rewarding gameplay experience.",3
"best like real gameplay! when you hear bullets pass over---- puts you in a place where you never think you be in.",5
"i finally have a computer that will run this game. it is so fun! from battle royale to fighting against ai on 7th cav server you wont be dissapointed.",2
"so buggy / glitchy, so frustrating, that i dont play it.",1
"the gameplay model is perfect and fun. but its almost unplayable due to fps lag. i bought this game after seeing streams of it. even with a beast of a pc youll end up with around 25-30 fps with everything on low. and that while the graphics themselfs arent that great either. it sure definitely wasnt worth 22 euros despite of me liking the gameplay model. i dont even know how they even dare asking 40+ euros for it. done some research and it seems that the fps lagg has been there since release and no attempt was made on improving it. what i also cant understand how steam finds this acceptable to put in their store. i just cant get over it that ive paid 22 euros for the game and cant even run it with 60fps on a 500$ graphic card. guys, if you can get it for around 5 euros id say go for it, but higher then that. dont bother.",5
"the arma3 is a massive military sandbox games that it has very true surrounding and experience.you can play a large number of mods that it build by players.i think it is very amazing.i played the wastland and the alits life mod.i felt that there is a real world i within it. if you are a military affairs fans,you should buy this game even it will cost 59.9 dollars.if you arent ,dont buy this one believe me the arma3 is a terrible game and wast your 59.9 bucks.",1
"after the great operation flashpoint (now arma: cold war assault) the first two armas where not that great, but still very good and i enjoyed playing them for a long time. arma 3 is my favourite part of the trilogy, thanks to a good and thrilling campaign (much better than cod or bf) and the arma formula, that perfectly works now. ai does what you want, their aim is very good and they are very helpful. enemy seeks cover and is a real threat, which makes the missions very thrilling. like in the first three rainbow six or the first ghost recon. the campaign feels very tense, like operation flashpoint or the addon resistance and i really enjoyed it. the game runs perfect on my two year old pc and it is sure beautiful. the sound is also very good and the rifles dont sound like toyguns which adds to the war atmosphere. voice acting is great too. the controls are a bit difficult to master at first if you havent played the other games of the series, but you get there with a little practice. the new item system is also very good and now you can quick and easy change weapons, put attachments on your rifle or grab some other gear. overall this game is one of my favourite games of all time and its a true masterpiece and thanks to the community you have tons of content for free. get it and enjoy it! :-)",1
"tried to do a backflip in a helicopter, didnt press z whilst upside down... i died. 99/11",1
"the game is great, its very glitchy and needs to fix bugs but overall is one of my favorite games.",2
"i think this is the beast game i have ever played just buy it now!!!!",1
"this game is enjoyable if you like realistic shooters. probably my favorite game on pc excluding league. arma has the advantage of mods over all other shooters. i highly recommend picking up the battle royale mod which turns the game into a dayz like free for all which is highly enjoyable when working together with friends. well worth 60 bucks although if you missed the sale and youre a friend of mine that i clearly told get arma 3 then you could have gotten more bang for the buck",1
"war simulator, not like call of duty this is not fast paced. if you get shot you die.",4
"like cod and battlefield you wont want to play them after playing this",1
"is arma 3 for everyone? no arma 3 is a military simulator with more emphasis on realism than action or fun. those who enjoy the experience will find it incredible, but i would recommend doing some research beforehand to make sure the game is right for you. the good: - incredibly detailed open world-style maps - wide range of weapons, vehicles, and equipment - incredibly powerful editor and high mod compatibility with a large community always creating new content. - top notch graphics that will strech even the most hardcore gaming pc the bad: - very high system requirements, dont expect to get a good frame rate without a decent system - network issues can be an issue from time to time - though much improved over arma 2, the character movement and vehicle handling can be clunky and a bit glitchy at times. overall i would say arma 3 is a very good game that will continue to only get better over time as the community and the developers create more and more content. however, if youre on the fence about it, make sure you do some reasearch before jumping into this title.",2
"amzing if you have other people to play with, the friendly ai is terrable dont expect to get anywhere with them.",1
"tons of bugs, the ai is horrible, the enemy ai can shoot your  off from across the map, commanding the ai is a , trained soldiers cant keep their weapon still after sprinting 5 meters, c-3po has smoother movement than the player. i know this is a milsim but it doesnt play like a sim at all, controls are confusing and there is too many of them and theyre spreads across the keyboard making me feel like i have to use both my hands on the keyboard. it feels like im trying to fly a spaceship, not make a human do simple everyday movement. yes i know i can place my own keybinds but whats the point of making the controls stupid like this in the first place? flying planes and choppers seems to be harder than it was in arma 2, im not sure if anything is changed or if its just been a long time since ive played arma 2 so im not gonna criticize that. as far as tanks and other land vehicles go it has the same problem as controlling the soldier, stiff and confusing, and the instructions arent really helping. if you like the feeling of actually having control of the charcter youre playing. dont get this",1
"absolutly amazing army simulator, great with friends if you wanna try something tactical. great game and love the custom maps which people make. very high quality and considered and can keep for entertained forever! great game. 9/10 con: the only con i have is the ai is very skilled when it comes to where you are, they know very much. but thats the only downside i have.",1
"good game but it needs pationt and to play with your friends .. if you like arma 2 , youll like this one",1
"good game maybe a little work but i see a lot of mods being made in futrue.",1
"if you wanna feel like a god sniper who has issues with killing hundreds of people. then i suggest you buy this game. also never and i mean never .............take your pants off when asked. they do things to you that will haunt you when you come back from the war.",1

"0/10 would not play again 0/10 graphics 0/10 gunplay 0/10 everything #cod4 #isbetter #loljkthisgameisactuallyreallyfun",1
"just purchased arma3 on the 50% of sale. i have to say i am a huge arma2 fan, but i was blown sky high when i started playing arma3. the reviews somehow just did not do it justice for a big arma2 fan. i actually did not know if it was that much different form arma2. i was so wrong. arma3 is better in every way so far. weapons, graphics, sound, player interaction, ui menus, etc. etc. i have only had it for one day now, and it is by far my best pc purchase in a long time. also, i have bought into all of the survival games on ea to which even though i am happy to support the games i chose to support, none of them have become fun to play for me. i like dayz mod and let me tell you breaking point for arma3 is the answer! you get a zombie game plus all those vehicles and weapons! the epoch servers are also so much fun in arma3, vehicles everywhere on some of them, planes, helis, tanks...etc. so much fun. good job bohemia interactive and good job to all the modders out there!",2
"whatever you wished for when playing ghost recon...",5
"great game love the continued development of it also!",1
"another amazing game from bi, arma 3 is great when playing with friends and even people you might not even know, some missions require teamwork or you will probably fail. although it has its pros and cons : pros: amazing engine nicely detailed gear and vehicles etc (not really an eye sore) somewhat good community a different campaign which talks about a island that is in the state of war. steam workshop cons: there are not a ton of vehicles and weapons, most of them are just the same. more clothing then actual things like vehicles. etc 9/10 awesome game but really needs more content in the original game.",3
"great game, its very fun but it would be best to play with a mic (multiplayer). they also have some great mods",3
"an old soldier, in a new outfit. a lot has changed in the game, the first improvement i would mention is the ai. npcs became more responsive of their surroundings and situations, making them a challenging foe or a good friend. i find it harder to eliminate enemies as they give supportive fire to each other and moving up to you, never leaving you space to attack. the commanding system is just as how i thought it is going to be. not much have improved, if i send a group into a building to set up a defensive posture, they still have no idea what to do and start to move around the building. yet again, i have to place them in the building one-by-one which is time consuming and especially bad in a combat situation. i like the new movement system and bullet ballistics. i have a more reliable control over my character, yet i find it difficult to hit a target and the enemy gets the same thing. now i wont get shot in the head from 100m with a pistol. ais are actually missing their shots, when shooting at me. the graphics are amazing, even in standard quality and i still get my average 50 fps. hell yeah! :d so far im liking this game, i just find it difficult to get used to the new movement and weapon system, but as it was with arma 2... ill get used to it slowly. :)",1
"extreamly coordinated assaults. actual military veterans play. good .",1
"as others have stated, arma 3 is an intense military simulation. if you want a bunny hoping, fast paced, kids game..... stick with one of the other shooters. if you want a immersive experience this is it. it is hard to find anything negative about this game for me, i absolutely love it. this is the best as far as i am concerned. it runs great even on my modest system (a few yrs old). although i am only a few hrs in i have enjoyed the single player as well as the multiplayer experience. when the bullets start flying.....you better hit the dirt, or you will be dead. 11+/10",1
"smashed into a sign with a military truck, broke everything 11/10 would eat nachos with.",1
"you should get it. not nearly as complex as people say it is, plus this game is a unique experience you cant get anywhere else",1
"one of my favourite games ever: definitely my favourite shooter, almost all of my hours have been placed into wasteland survival and just practising my helo skills - if you are to pick this game up be aware that there is a steep learning curve and practically every key has a function. ive put 100s of hours into many aspects of the game, and ive still only scratched the surface. one thing im eagerly anticipating is the arrival of the 2017 mod which is a dayz esce revamp of the game, focused more so on surviving then wasteland.",2
"now it is in stablized version, lest play some campaign shall we?",2
"not that much my style of game, i like altis life. 7/10",1
"its pretty good. the setting and the pricing for the dlcs are a let down but other than that this game is fantastic.",1
"beautiful game nice game if you have 60usd buy this game im trust",1
"if you do not have friends to play with this game is really boring! without friends it is also hard as hell because most people travel in packs. if you get this game get the breaking point mod and it will more enjoyable. i have liked playing it with friends though, it does make for some exciting times. if you are use to cod or battlefield this is not in your wheel house. you can go days without seeing anyone at all in the less filled servers. in the packed full servers you die really quickly. in the end it is probably not the best game and is not for everyone but i like it! 7/10",1
"hey guys if your looking t get this game ite real fun ive had agreattime the devs did a really good.. you should totslyy buy it. if you get it ctslk to me i need people to talk to",1
"great game with infinite possibilites due to a sandbox world, if you plan on buying this game, you should also consider getting a high end cpu if you want to play on large multiplayer server.",1
"boring as hell! arma games are so overated, i played arma 2 and arma 3, both have the same issues, boring gameplay, and optimized like crap! i can play most of the games at 1080p/60fps but this game even on low settings i always got like 20-30fps, thats very sad since this is a pc game only, the game is just not well optimized",1
"seemed pretty fun, but i think it would be much better if it was actually optimised and able to get more than 25 frames. its way to arcadey, and took arma 2s barebone flight mechanics and somehow made it worse. barely anyone online (probably playing their $30 mod) too. playing this game makes me want to be a ing terrorist, so i could do the world a favor and kill the team at bi who made this. 9.999999999/10 its alright",1
"my second day playing it and already experiencing stupid bugs. some game controllers disappear after being killed in mp on win8.1 64bit. its beyond annoying and many people are experiencing similar issues.",1
"great gun mechanics with an emphasis on customization. decent simulation mechanics, however it is the sheer freedom that this game offers that makes it excellent. the hundreds of user-made game modes that make this game what it is.",1
"i love this game and especially the sniping (of course) and its just awesome to talk to your spotter and taking down targets.",1
"ive been playing for a few hours and to be honest, i dont really see what all the hype is about. its not a fun game. its a simulator of how much it sucks to honestly go to war. ill keep playing and hope that i like this game later, at least enough to possibly recommend it.",1
"this game is fantastic and multiplayer is excellent great game cant wait for more dlc",1
"rated one of the best simulator of this year, it needs some work, but mods help make it feel better made with the stock arma 3 isnt good. sure, it is the newest it still in development, i hope in the future they will add more vehicles and weapons",3
"awesome game! you should buy this game if your pc can run it otherwise you will get 20- fps and thats not playable.",2
"like skyrim with bugs but really, dont get this horrible excuse of a full release. the video in the steam page is either touched up or on a $10,000 gaming rig, because this game looks, feels, and runs like complete sh:t",1
"this is a must buy for those ppl that want action and strategy.if you want to play on good server play on g4/wastelans/base/survival/food theres twos of this servers and i recomend epoch for more in depth base building.i hope you have a good time in this game and good luck.:)",1
"liked it but was annoyed by the lack of content compared to arma 2 i love arma 2 but arma 3 is a disapointment compare many features of arma 2 to the lack in arma 3 i like the workshop but i needs more with the base game",1
"this game is totaly waste of money for amd owners. getting too low fps with poor cpu - gpu usage. fps around 15-30 with high settings and its dramaticly same with low settings too. not optimized for amd cpu - apu. totaly unplayable for amd owners. i opened a ticket on steam cs for refund my money.",1
"the server browser sucks , it cuts out your internet everytime you refresh the list of servers and the game is poorly optimized, but once you actually get into the game it is a lot of fun.",1
"the life servers/mods can make you spend way too many hours infront of your pc. if you like i bought arma ii first, arma iii is just an perfect sequel. 10/10 -xar",2
"a vast improvement over arma 2, well worth the time to try it out for yourself.",1
"a pretty hard simulator to master for someone who is new to the series. it does, however, have an impressive world to explore and battle through but the game suffers from proper teaching (as it is multiplayer-based) so it is quite confusing for me and it has really dissapointing frame-rate performances; even if your rig is overkill. a tough game to recommend but it would be much more enjoyable if the game runs better and is more understandable. + immersive world + good teamwork + very enjoyable if understand - poor performance - somewhat hard to play, which links to low framerates a mixed thumbs up",1
"aema 3 game is a very good game for its graphis nad visual thanks",1
"extremely fun team based combat with awesome graphics",3
"i honestly havent played much of arma 3 itself, but i highly recommend this game to people who like games that involve cops and criminals, because altis life servers on arma 3 are actually quite amazing fun when youre not on a server with people who abuse the cop positions. i honestly have had a lot of fun doing cocaine runs in this game and even having those moment where clans would stop you in the middle of the road just to take everything you own. so if youre looking to buy arma 3 - id suggest taking a look at altis life as it definitely wont be a choice youll regret.",2
"when i got arma 3 i was a little worried that this game would not be for me. but after putting over 200 hours into the game, i can safely say this game is an amazing video game and highly recommened it to any call of duty players as my self looking for a new way of looking at war games. arma 3 provides so much along the line of the base story, super fun multiplayer games, and also an awesome editor system. some things i suggest doing if you buy this game is finding a group of people to play with. because although this game is great by its self, it is much more fun with freinds. i have met alot of great people on this game that i play with constanly. another thing i suggest you do in arma 3 is try out the editor. you can make some really cool stuff with it. i have made around 6 missions that i can play with my freinds whenever i want to. now i am not going to lie there are some bad things about this game as well. for one multiplayer can get a little stupid sometimes along the lines of, well other players. there is also the glitches that pop up now and again. and if you really want to have fun in this game you better have some good internet connection and a decent computer. but all in all this game is pretty darn good and i highly recommend this game to war game gamers.",2
"i cant run multiplayer over 10fps even i have better specs than recommended!",1
"very good game..but a little bit too heavy for a gaming pc..i have i5 4430 8gb ram & gtx770 and i cant handle it with 60fps while i am streaming..please just make a new patch for cpu cores because mine hits on 80& usage..:( i am playing on high setting without anti-allaiting on 54 fps on average..soo bad for gaming rig with 2 ssds and some good parts!",1

"had firefight of epic proportions. died falling down stairs. 10/10",3
"this is a really great game if your in to the realizam of millitary from your home",1
"i go into the game and play on a server where we were rebels and fighting the ai un. i started as a simple medic then about 3 minutes in im suddenly leading 40 mean agianst a few hundred ai. on our first mission we were trying to land in on the west coast and we went into town and encountered 2 ifvs and we die. but on the next mission were caturing airfields with the trucks choppers and tanks we needed. so we mount up and with our 2 tanks and support from the choppers we start heading an attack on a un fort. even though we lost both tanks we killed 12 tanks and cptured 3 choppers and split the un forces on the island in half. most of the rest of the game was clearing out towns and cities until we started hitting the uns airfields and forts. soon though i was leading 20 men into a large town. suddenly the ai drops 6 choppers and were digging to fight for our lives. me and one friend escaped meeting up with a strike team to the north. it was one hell of a ride.",1
"its awesome dont miss it, there r so many rpgs so u wont get bored",1
"great milsim, good ballistics, powerful editor, endless replayability, this game has it all. with the new dlcs coming out this game will only get better. the only thing i could complain about is the ai. they are a bit overpowered. however, the multiplayer makes up for it. i really recommend samatras king of the hill. even with all this, i suggest you pick this up while its on sale. if you ask me, its a little expensive for what it has to offer.",2
"this is a great game and i think that you should play this game. this game has fun multiplayer and has mods like battle royel and atlis life.",1
"this is definatley the best sandbox game out there, it has a great and creative community which have created amazing variants, such as wasteland or king of the hill. it is always action packed online and it runs smoothly on most pcs. there is so much to learn and do which is why i find it so addictive and would recommend it to anyone i know.",1
"played altis life and started off with small truck, did drugs, kidnaped people, and role played as a cop. in the end i came out with many helicopters but my expert pilot decided to mow the grass with the blades. ~~10/10 would mlg agian",1

"a game with an experience and community like no other, with a multitude of game styles on a scale that destroys all rivalry",4
"the game isnt to easy on newbies but it has a grat community that is willing to help. its a lot of fun to work with them team and accomplish the objectives. there are also several mods that offer new maps and game mods!",1
"worst game ive played in a long time, way too complex for a game.",1
"after playing arma 3, other fps games feel too arcade-ish.",2
"it may not be a shooter for the masses, but arma 3 succeeds where battlefield fails - in being a true open-world combat simulator. you will die (a lot), but as you start to learn how to actually play a tactical fps, youll die less, and every kill gained will be a significant accomplishment. and the size of the maps...oh my gosh! theyre huge!! theres nothing quite like jumping in a helicopter and performing a night op with a friend over the many, many kilometres of island terrain. oh, i hope you have a powerful computer, because youll need it to run arma 3 in all its glory.",1
"if you like buggy  that doesnt work, this is the game for you. thank you bohemia, for another glorious crapfest.",1
"i was flying a helicopter with the maximum amount of people on it, some1 shoots me while in the heli, cant do anything to control it, no copilot, heli going maximum speed of crash, when an enemy helicopter flys right below me and i get points for hitting their blades and making them crashes while it stablizes us, land almost perfectly without doing anything, i then get revived by my teammates 10/10 would get shot again",1
"there is really no way of explaining this game to anyone who hasnt played it. its awesome. its fun. its total freedom. its a community. its dedication. its tons of bugs and glitches. its the thing you want to do with your friends on a friday night. its blowing  up, cruising with technicals and flying in helos. its at the same time realism and make-believe. its frustratingly hard at times. its long intervals of doing nothing. its modding, modding and more modding. its fps drops. its only limited by your imagination. its even more awesomeness. hell, enough talk! buy the the godd*mn game!",3
"full of glitches and the multiplayer is super laggy if you run on the same settings as you play on single player. it has super clunky controlls and weird animations which makes it feel unrealistic. i do not recommend this game to others",1
"great game, well worth the money i paid for it. i would recommend this game to every one of my friends...",5
"fun game very badly optimized you will have tons of problems with your game and get low fps but if you have a really good pc that can play on ultra with 60+ fps then you will probably get 20-50 fps but there is a way top fix that if you really want to fix it but you dont have to if you can deal with a lower frame rate defintaly a fun game i cant see playing it alone very much must have friends in this a lot of people in this game can be either extreme a holes or really serious but fun people some servers require you to sign up and be accepted in but those can be the best i do recomend but only if it is on sale for $35 or lower. hope this helped you.",1
"arma 3 is an awesome game... i may not have played much of it.but it is very fun to play and the campaign is a challenge (at least to me). i would recommend buying this game if you are doubtful.",1
"i have owned this game for a long period of time (since alpha) but never played it that much seeming as i never played with anyone however this february 2014, i have had a blast playing with a few friends; demonofsparks and theavengedkoala. wasteland is a fantastic game mode and i could not believe the time i was spending playing this. we all started playing at 10am and before we know it, it was 7pm. the time flew, especially when we are building/protecting our base, sneaking to the gun shop, stealing weapon caches, flying helis and aircraft aswell as crashing into little stones on the road and your car completely blowing up. this truly is a very fun game - even if the price is steep. so buy this game and i will see you in the wasteland!",1
"cant run it on my dell laptop well but from the little bit that ive played it its pretty fun i guess",1
"this game is so good that whenever i play it i bleed profusely from all of my orifices because i cant contain how excited it makes me.",2
"read this before you buy the game, because youre about to step into a massively new world. arma 3 was such a big leap since arma 2 and left many arma players shocked (including me). with new weapons, vehicles, infantry, drones, maps, and more leaves you with a brand new world to explore. now that you can swim, you have a wider access to the new maps. unlike arma 2, you will actually enjoy swimming in the ocean! there is much more to talk about, but its too much to explain. one word before i go, amazing.",2
"i got the game while it was free for two days and it was awsome, i loved everything about the game, but it was a little to graphic for my windows 7. but trust me this is worth 59.99. but make sure your pc can take the graphics.",1
"i love this game, nice quality and cool ai. but i havent seen any gamemode where people can fight (in vehicles) against each other.",1
"been a fan since ofp and happy to see theyve continued to improve. ui can still use some work, but overall a good and unique experience.",1
"beautiful graphics, incredible content in game and via steam workshop a lot of mods available online, a must have for people looking for another kind of shooter or military enthusiast not fast paced, incredibly insane feeling when you cant even see the enemy and youre being shot at 10/10",1

"this is my first time playing this game... lots of good reviews , but the storyline is a complete . i cant cope and understand what they try to reach the story upon us... i got high hopes when i bought this game, but frankly a dissapointment.",1
"this game is one of the best simulators i have ever played. it contains many improvements to the engine, graphics, and controls since arma 2. this game has been made better by the steam workshop to host a ton of downloadable senarios. i would recommend you play this game with friends, or some sort of community. some negatives of this game, is its performance, i requires a powerful computer to play, even then there is some sort of performace drop. also there was a lack of single player content, but there is now some being released. im looking forward to the future of this game as it gains popularity, and plus with all the cool expansions arma 2 had, there will probably be new content in the future. one more thing is that there is a huge difficulty spike because its a simulator. this is no call of duty or battle field, and requires alot of time to get used to. if you never had any experience with arma games and you are not shure if you should get arma 3, buy arma 2 + oa, it has been on sale recently for really cheap.",1
"arma 3 is very glitched ad horribly unoptimized and yet is still an amazing game so i will rate it a 4 and reccomend it!",1
"this game is a very well made military simulator. it is very realistic, unlike most fps games. im not discrediting call of duty or battlefield, but this game is a much more realistic experience.",1
"this game is okay, said no one ever. this game is boring, said no one ever. this game is too much like call of duty, said no one ever. the mods in this game are awful, said no one ever. this game is awesome, said everyone ever.",1
"not the same as battlefield or cod, but an experience you can only get from arma. scenarios can be crazy in multiplayer and even better to play with friends. highly recommend, but dont expenct the contstant fast paced action in fps as it is a simulation after all.",1
"a fantastic game with great multiplayer and the best mission editor ive ever played with. this game almost does arma 2 justice, it includes some great graphics options (picture-in-picture, post-processing effects, draw-distance) which allows it to run on some pretty low-end computers (im running it on near max with a 6670! (all on high/ultra with a view-distance of 3.5km)) the campaign is a vast improvement over arma 2s campaign including proper voice acting, realistic plot and some nice comedy hidden around the map. id rate this game 8/10 > great campaign > fantastic editor < quite buggy (none which are game breaking) > fantastic modding community < lack of units/ a lot of reused assets",4
"it would be fun they said... it would have cars they said... i would not die horriobly they said... i would not get run over they said... my framerate would not dip below 60 fps they said... i would have no bugs they said... i would not get pushed off the road by some  in a gokart they said... they lied... 11/10 would get run over by russian guy again.",1

"best game i have ever played. the arma series is realy improving from arma2 to arma3. the graphics are superb, frame rate is good, overall it still needs some work on campaign and map design. i recently read a post from the mayor of altis and he said that it turend their peaceful little island into a battleground and that it showed a local buisness factory that is private and secret. overall i rate this game a 4 out of 5.",4

"absolutely love this game so far! spent hours and hours only on a3wasteland and i have yet to try other mods with friends! optimizing the game for good fps is a little tricky (considering im running 2x 970s in sli and a 4790k...) but once you hit the sweet-spot in the settings menu, you are ready to go. like any other games by bohemia interactive, it takes a while to grasp the controls and over-all feel of the game. having previously played over 400 hours of standalone, i thoroughly enjoy the vehicle and base-building aspects of game modes like a3wasteland (atha & daddy) which is a hell of an experience when playing in a small or even large group. i recommend the [amg] a3wasteland par antha & daddy server as i have enjoyed every second on that server. overall: 9/10.",1
"this is a good military game. so life like. real time",1
"its fun, but my gfx card isnt good at all so i cant play really well. but in fact, its still fun.",1
"aside from being a highly toxic free for all with the few exceptions of those who have friends to play with, this is the best realistic military experience you can have with guns and combat. i especially love the epoch/overpoch; dayz type mods. so, if you are a hardcore gamer and want to have a hardcore experience, play this game or go play call of duty and counter-strike with the kiddies. this game is for a real man looking for some realistic combat situations/enviorments. edit: buy the dlcs or you wont be having the best experience. bohemia needs to make money just like the next guy. we all have bills.",1
"i found a car in battle royale and as i was searching it, a guy ran up, took the car and ran me over with it. 10/10",1
"a great game, fun to play with friends. honestly, i feel a bit ripped off by the lack of content provided by the developers, and the gameplay seems aimed at entertaining the call of duty/battlefield fps crowd. they continue to update it with new content, but it just doesnt hold my interest very long. not to mention the many unrealistic features they added in to make it combat seem more fluid and fast if you are overflowing with $$$, and you feel like buying it, go ahead. i would not recommend buying it just yet.",1
"game = mods great game! constant hours played on altis life and a3l. the fact is this game is pretty boring without the mods added into it, most will agree with me! i think the highlight of what made arma 3 a popular game was the altis life mod which made a fun environment where communities could form and do rp within the game, that mod is recommened. however despite having nearly 150hours just on altis life, a new mod a3l i has sparked up and taken over in opinion. the mod is a other rp mod like altis life however more shops, a new map [lakeside] and is taken more serious but is more fun to be fair. from robbing banks to being in a high speed chase as a cop, you can do it all for yourself here. arma 3 is the game for you to get into the modded games community for sure, you may even make your own community out of it [own a server]. note this game also has improved graphics from arma 2 and really is smooth when playing [no more desync]. ratings below: arma 3 [no mods]: 5/10 arma 3 [mods]: 10/10 thanks",3
"i shot a 120mm round at a guys knee... i never saw him again 10/10 would recommend",1
"although in its early stages this game has true potential. some issues need to be fixed on multiplayer to combat people stealing your vehicles as soon as you spawn however the game is very enjoyable. i wouldnt reccomend this game to those of you that have weak computers. even on low graphics it still requires quite a lot of work and it can;t really be enjoyed if everyone looks like a potatoe. overall good game that will be promising in the future with a very tactiful community, many battles lasting may hours await you.",1
"one of the best games out if you ask me. if you love military shooter games and love to actually play as team and not just play some type bf or call of duty where you just run around shoot  you will enjoy this game. campiagn is a decent lenght(if you play on the hardest settings it will take you weeks lol) but the mp is where the game shines. i personallly play on co-op servers that run invade and annex or patrol ops and its almost like playing a real war(i highly recommend the 7thcavalry co-op servers). you do get the mp servers that run stupid  like wasteland(dayz rip off but worse) or atlis life( sims ripoff) but thats not what this game is about. do you love the thrill of hearing the bullets fly past your head or want to pilot a transport helio or attack helio giving the ground forces some cover and take out the armor or maybe you want to jump in a tank to lighten up the enemies forces or a artillery vehicle and use the viop to have the forces closer to the fight mark or even use there laser guided scope to spot targets and light them up. this game has finally fillled the hole in my heart for a real war shooter that i have been begging and praying for the last 20 years. this is the closeest game you will get to the real thing! i highly recommend getting this game.",1
"needs to be played with friends, and lots of them, to achieve its full potential.",1
"it is really a great ecperience with friends and foes it gets my vote that is for sure",1
"only buy this if you have an intel processor cuz with amd the fps lagg makes it unplayable online...in scum developers wont even add the amd lagg into their known problems list...otherwise it would be an awesome-awesome platform.",1
"this game is a definite improvement over its predecessor, despite the optimization issues for those running lower level intel rigs or mid-high level amd rigs. even on low this game looks impressive and if you have an intel cpu (or high level amd cpu) & decent gpu (either brand) you should be able to run it on high where the visuals are sure to impress. the ai has improved over arma ii, though not tremendously, you will still have issues commanding your squad to do exactly what you want them to but theyre not quite as derpy. if you decide to get this game youre definitely going to have fun with it, i strongly reccommend to google custom optimisation settings and tinker with it until you have the most stable frames you can achieve. finally, the modding community for this game is excellent, there are plenty of great mods on the workshop and community sites like armaholic.",1
"a really good game. its realistic and has a lot of possibilities.",1
"let me tell ya sth bout this gaem... 1) its 10/10 for noscoping noobs thats think that bcz they are good att bf and cod they are good at any game. 2) 15fps on low in a city still worth, not playable but worth 3) graphics, meh...id go for full high no matter whats your pc your so or so not gonna have good fps even on low so why watch sh*t when you can watch the 10/10 graphics 4) engine, meh you cant jump... still 10/10 10/10 would play again if it wasnt for decync and my sh*t net",1
"this game is one of the best games i ever played but i highly suggest get a high end computer for playing multiplayer. but if you like tactical shooter games with 1st person/ 3rd person this is the one to get.",1
"i liked the 3rd person mode and the vehicle textures",1
"arma 3 may not be the best arma but it still is awsome! the only problems i have with the game is that the game is set in the future which makes it have some dumb weapons that i dont like. the good thing is that i can easly fix that by intalling some mods",1
"if you are looking for a tictical military simulation get arma 3",1
"exactly the same as arma ii but it looks a lot prettier. an improvement is that optimization is better... not on a server... which is where most of the game is played.",1
"in the beginning the controls were so frustrating that i quited several times until i was determined to continue and learn the game i payed for with my hard earned bucks. once i knew everything, i had an absolute blast. from flying choppers, to taking a 20 minute trip to the main ao. the map is extremely huge! i like everything about the game except for the standard bugs (what a f shame) and the dlc. not enough content. looks like a rip off. anyway, i highly recommend this game for anyone who likes dedicated communities and team work. be determined to learn and i guarantee you that you will have a blast. you will enjoy the game and its community.",1
"arma 3 is a good game. that if you havent played arma 2. this game doesnt have the same feel or the same look as arma 2. arma 2 is a better game in almost every way. this game feel likes it was cut short. it doesnt feel done. anyway, if you want a good arma game, go ahead and get arma 2 and operations arrow head. not a bad game, but arma 2 is much better. oh, and my i add this game is an fps hell. it doesnt play well at all, and its looks awful doing so",1
"crawled in the grass for 3 hours, guy shot me. would die again, 10/10",1
"this game has the best grafics ive every seen in my life!",1
"cool looking game but way too many issues still. enemy ai is still ridiculous. even the pistol still doesnt show up in the holster, yet they are releasing dlc. overall its ok but not really worth the current price.",1

"can be awesome if you can get ahold of some of the great mods and a good group of folks to play mp with. other than that, you probably wont have much fun. ive been playing arma titles since operation flashpoint came out.",1
"this game is so realistic, i love it. this is the game youre looking for if you search for mature players",1
"bloody brilliant, muchly improved from arma 2 - quite superb combat sim",1
"this game is amazing! so fun and unlike any other game. i highly recommend purchasing it, well worth 60 dollars.",1
"good maps very nice mods and okay grafics. its have some bugs but that is often not very bad bugs so is pretty litle bugs for the game its self so its good. but what i love with arma 3 is that you can find so many good servers that got all sort of gamemodes like real tactical domination servers and hardcore roleplay servers.",3
"from what i can gather, its almost exactly like being in the real army as a proper soldier. even guys that are actually real soldiers are saying this on the internet in forums and what have you. i guess they do this when they get back from a patrol or something and then start playing arma 3 and theyre like hang on,this is supposed to be my layabout time, why am i putting myself through all of this again? and on my own dime to boot! anyway, infinity ward have created another scorcher with this one.",1

"the only thing you have to say about arma 3 is that is is ing amazing",2
"i would reccomend this game to anyone who has played arma before. i wouldnt reccoment it to anyone who hasnt played a previous arma game because to a new comer the controlls and idea behind the game are a bit cofusing. arma 2 is a bit easier for noobs but this game is great!",1
"i was planning on buying this game for an huge ammount of time, when it was in sale last week i bought it. i mostly bought it for altis life, but then i met the amazing modding community of arma 3. i bought arma 2 for dayz and i felt really sad when there wasnt a dayz mod for arma 3 (except breaking point). after some time playing i saw that my friend bought the game too and we played a lot together. its really fun when youre with friends. the game is great and it is worth its money.",1
"my favorite steam game! many free mods (altis life, wasteland, hostile takeover, breaking point, etc) we play @",5
"this is one of the better games i have played from graphics to gameplay. it has multiple new weapons and vehicles, ai will actually be somewhat fair and not use their wallhacks, and pvp is suprisingly good. the only minor flaw about the game is that the ai still have very bad pathing in some areas and that they sometimes automatically know where you are. while mods can fix alot of what bohemia didnt, its still a very good game overall. definately recommended if you dont already have it.",2
"i think it is the best arma seiries yet i totaly recomend it for anybody who is a total war/army simulator fanatic.",1
"its really good i love it the community is great :d",1
"well if you can play this then go for it but dis game not optimizsedsed and not run good, my 2 gtx 780s can run this fine but with occasi0n4l proble,ms game pley is gud but sumtimes lots of running and driving but overall 75/100",1
"arma 3. one of the games that is just so hard to review because of the many different ways you can go about it. lets just say, i recommend it if you like 30 fps even with a mid to high end pcs. very heavy on cpu and not very well optimised, but its arma. what you get is huge maps. love it.",2
"this game is fantastic if you enjoy games that require you to work as a team to complete objectives. grab some friends jump on a server and let the team building begin. prefer to go solo? well the campaign is absolutley spectacular. still not interested? you can always play with the mods that are always coming out and being updated. in short there is something for everyone.",1
"this game is a huge disapointment so far, like they took ace mod and used new graffix.",1
"this is a really good fps and simulator that allows you to create your own mission and play as one of the soldiers.",1
"love it or hate it, but you wont be on the fence about it. i love it and if i had time it would swallow my life whole. (un?)fortunately theres another (none) game out there that can do the same; rocksmith 2014 and i cant put that one down either so at tqeh moment rs2014 is winning out, but i have no doubt i will return to arma 3 and loose a whole other chunk of my life!!!",1
"this game is great, bohemia interactive did a good job improoving on some of the things that were not so good in arma 2. for instance there is a massive inprovement in physics and the ability to go on or below the surface of the water is something that is not needed but adds a whole new experience to the game and something else to watch out for. the maps are detailed and interesting and the veichles have been given the pip feature (picture in picture) so wile your in a veichle there are backup cameras or mirrors that actually show what is behind you. all of the veichles both land air or sea have great modles and a relistic sound effect that makes the game even more imersive. i definitly recomend this game to anyone who likes a tactical military simulator. also those that are contimplating getting the upgrade form arma 2 you will be pleasantly suprised.",1
"the best war sim to date. not just pick up and play, but that is rarely the case with any deep simulation game. arma 3 is crafted by developers that care for the game and the community and you will not find a better military sandbox game to play in.",1
"its arma 3 a simulator you can simulate everything from real live to armagedon nice grafics nice gameplay 9/10 almost perfect",1
"optimized for nvidia cards. feels unfinished but none the less if you like simulation games and a fan of the arma series by bohemia interactive then i stongly recommend this game. its set a little bit in the future",2
"fun, but would be better if it was more like arma 2.",1
"numer one military simulator game. the vast amount of scale and realism is incomparable. a great addition to arma series, and definitely worth the money.",2
"the keybinds and controls are so absolutely garbage i honestly believe the develeopers are trying to troll. hands down, the most unintuitive and convoluted shooter ever. i have never before played a game and actually wished it had a how to play tutorial.",1
"the game mwas fun to p[lay it runs perfict on ultra or low grapichs and i think everyone should get it when you have a chance",1
"was told not to run over goats with truck. did it anyway. 10/10",1
"some good stuff is waiting for you. i recommend it!",1
"arma 3 isnt a game about shootin. its about the life of your character its about how long you can strive and live its about flyig its about driveing its about liveing! forget about shooting let your vehicles do it for you....this is what this game is about ladies and gentlemen!",4
"arma 3 is an excellent game for any hardcore realism shooter player, and is still a good game for casual shooter players. through its a great game, the one thing which sold me on arma is the freedom you get. when i play any other shooter, i am frequently dissappointed by some of the features in movement, weapons, and vehicles. for example, i may be playing red orchestra, a slightly less hardcore fps, and am trying to work some cover, but its either slightly higher or slightly lower than the crouch and standing positions. in arma, i could use the stance system to barely peek just my head and gun above cover to fire. or, i might be playing planetside 2 and somebody is hiding behind a wall. in arma, i could shoot through the wall, use smoke to cover my approach, lob a grenade behind it, call for fire support, air support, or my squadmates. its these choices and freedoms which raise the bar in every other shooter ive played and have consistently brought me back to arma, despite the clunky-ish and complex controls. 9/10 - would reccomend to a friend.",2
"arma 3 is best with a group of people that will show you how to play it. arma can be played by anyone, if your fan of rpg there are game modes for you, if youre a action fast pace pvp player there is a place for you too. but lets not forget that arma is a simulation, no matter what gameplay youll pick, there are limitations made by game which you may not like. overall, its a great game with fantastic community.",3
"ok so i love cpu games over console, but this is pants man really p*** poor ,my cpu not the latest but apart from a few whos is? its the same buggy s*** as usual. dont buy i only did because it was on offer big waste of money.",1
"very fun with friends and without friends. be sure to play the epoch mod and breaking point its hella fun!!!!",2
"it is highly realistic. if you are expect a call of duty or battle field experience, you wont like it. this game is one like no other with realsitic guns and graphics",1
"doesnt run worth a crap on my pc. still dont care. best game of 2013.",2
"very bad optimized like dayz standalone. the game could have been sooo much better if they would have optimized it overall the game is super fun but that can get taken away by all the lag and  so if you have a decent computer i would get it :)",2
"a super polished arma 2 with lots of new features that can only get better.",1
"it runs realllyyyy bad on my gtx 760 . i would not recommend this game untill they get rid of some of the bugs edit- get battle royale !!!!!!!! its amazing",1
"amazing game really love playing this would recommend it to all my friends",1
"one of the best military simulation games known in a gamers world ! keep it up bohemia interactive! hooah!",1
"played arma 2 and loved it, this is a good upgrade. feels a lot smoother.",1
"drove over a stone all wheels blew out. 11/10 amazing",2
"runs like , just like arma 2. the arma series continues to be a game that has promise, and is actually good when it runs properly, but that isnt the case for a large portion of the player base. you think you have good hardware? are you confident the computer you just spent a lot of money on is able to handle this game? think again, perfomance seems to be completely random in this game. on one hand you have someone with a mediocre machine, runs the game fine, and on the other you have someone who spent a lot of time and money setting up his machine and he can barely run it. its a lottery, and the chances of winning are low. this isnt a review, its a warning. if you have ways to test the game on your machine before you buy it, do it! otherwise you might regret your purchuse.",1
"this game is pretty beautiful, thats about as far as it goes really..",1
"much improved over arma ii. loads of downloadable content especially for multiplayer/co-op. the ai is smart enough so that each scenario is not exactly the same every time. on the down side, development seems to be a bit slow. there are still some glitches, and patches arent released regularlly. some of the keystrokes take some getting used to. if you are using mouse/keyboard, do yourself a favor and practice flying the helos before attempting to use them in missions. 4/5 stars.... with potential! loads of fun to play",1
"good game to play, single or multiplayer. plenty to do in it.",5
"if you love milsim this is the alpha male of that category!!! enjoy and check out my youtube",1
"endless fun with huge gamepaly improvements over arma 2.",1
"crazy good game. im temted to buy it but its a bit too expencive in my opinion (and does not fit in my buget). i was however able to get hold of it for an hour (free download event) and it was good fun and enjoyd every second of that hour.",1
"the best game of the 2010s, i have to admit, it is even better than skyrim. the level of simulation and reality in this game, coupled with the combination of fun and play is amazing. i never thought that a simulation could be this realistic and fun at the same time! must buy, 17/10, absolutley amazing!!! you are an idiot if you dont buy this!",2
"i have not bought this game (yet) but i played it in the free weekend. i loved it, i love how realistic it sounds. sure the no bipods are a little bit annoying. but the game is continually tweaked and small things will be added in due time. i am a big fan of sound effects, and arma 3 delivers them on a silver  platter with the best poutine in the world. the purchasing factor on this game was sound effects. after about 5 minutes i found my way into an artillery. then i fired it. oh my god, i felt the rumble in my feet (subwoofer on my desk) and the bang in my ears. arma 3 is the best game if you want the best sound effects in a shooter. battlefield, call of duty, and world of tanks, dont even come close to this level of sound effect quality. arma 3 is in a class of its own, and when i say that i mean that there is not even a teacher because all the other games have to take from arma 3 in order to be in that class. for me? this is hands down the game of the decade. this game is awesome in sound, graphics, mechanics and realism. i would buy the  out of it",1
"can you do more free wekends of free weeks please i love this game but dont have that much money to get it so could you do some more free wekends or weeks i really enjoyed them and may consider buying it one day",1
"this is a really good game, i enjoy playing this game loads. the amount of gamemodes is great as theres loads of things to do and popular gamemodes such as wasteland can give you hours of fun. worth the money 100%",2
"it is like real war with slightly worse fps in multiplayer.",1
"a very cool game, i just need a new videocard so i can play it in all its glory. also would like to find a good arma 3 comunity.",1
"from the small campaign, to the multiplayer and editor, this game has something for those who mod, those who make maps and those who mess around on altis life. the campaigns are short but sweet, they leave you feeling so great, from the get go, you get to experience the great graphic qualitys that this game has to offer, once you finish a campaign, the next chapter starts where the last ended. in overview, the campaign isnt something that the purchaser of arma is after, its the multiplayer, the multiplayer has the realism of a modern simulator, and the great amounts of gamemodes and servers avalible leaves you with an amazing choice of things to do, from; wasteland, life servers, tdm, anex and invade, conquest, king of the hill, battle royal and so many more. another great thing with the steam community is the mods, with new mods daily your experience can be forever changing. yes sure this game still has some of the buggy gameplay that all the armas had, but you either love arma, or you hate it.",4
"altis life, wasteland, king of the hill, co op missions and much more for arma 3. best game played so far.",2
"very nice update to arma 2, particularly on the graphics side (recommend big gfx card). some work is still needed though, as single-player missions are still missing.",2
"if you want to buy this game to play coop with your friend - never try do this. the only reason to do it is if you want to see server is not responding all the time you want to connect. it is very strange that such an easy issue is still not solved in 2014. dont spend your money on this game.",1
"the best shooter,tactic game i ever played i also love the editor to",2
"great game, need a quite powerfull computer to handle it, overall one of the best games i have ever played",1
"best game evea all i play tho is epoch mod xd its like the better versoin of all dayz related games(better than h1z1 too)",1
"the first couple days, can be really painful for most of the people, arma 3 is kinda hard to understand, its not for everyone especially not for bf/cod lovers, the maps are really great, graphics are awesome same as the audio, this game is made really good, not as arma 2. arma 2 is lagging a lot, has a lot of fps drops, playing arma 2 on 1920x1080 mid/low and i have only 30-60 fps, arma 3 on 1920x1080 ultra high/high 80 fps +++, half of arma 3 players cant kill a standing player, so the combat is pretty easy id say, the game is pretty expensive but its definitely worth the money, 10/10.",1
"great gramphics great grameplay. not nescassarely a good thing.",1
"very good, i like the life servers, you can do anything! i like to deliver packages and earn money.",1
"amazing sound and ambience in the third installment. the ultra realism and amazing custom creations from the community makes this game very different, from life simulation and full scale war. simply stunning, but dont expect a good single player campaign, get a better campaign from the steam workshop",1
"an amazing step up from arma 2 with better graphics and smoother gameplay while still retaining the core principles that make arma what it is. now with the first part of the campaign released, it finally feels like the complete package with a gripping and interesting story. if you in any way enjoyed arma 2 then buy this because you wont be dissapointed.",5
"this is one of the better games i have played from graphics to gameplay. it has multiple new weapons and vehicles, ai will actually be somewhat fair and not use their wallhacks, and pvp is suprisingly good. the only minor flaw about the game is that the ai still have very bad pathing in some areas and that they sometimes automatically know where you are. while mods can fix alot of what bohemia didnt, its still a very good game overall. definately recommended if you dont already have it.",2
"this game is fun, looks great, and is just straigh up awesome. pros: graphics new vehicles new weapons sounds gameplay large maps ability to customize your weapons attachments ways to store more gear other than a backpack. ability to move fast while prone/ do other things while prone (inventory, heal yourself etc.) cons: it may seems like it is laking content, but there are a lot of things to do not as big of a population in players that there was in arma 2 the npcs dont seem to notice you as often so you can really just shoot them a lot w/out being shot at unless youre really close. this game still has more to come and i would recommend it.",1
"this game costs like $60 now.. but it should cost more .. because its awesome! yee! best graphic game ever see, nice tactics and the best thing is that you can make the mission that you wish for. and post it to others. and also so many missions are already in the workshop. would give the game a 10 out of 10 :o",1
"playing this by yourself and not working together with others this game is quite boring but if you have friends to play with all kinds of fun can be had good game not great but good",1
"great game, great graphical infrastructure and great team play. this game has it all. with modding available in the workshop, you can create your own war. if your a fps fanattic, this is the war game for you! online is just as fun :)",1
"the arma series is excellent, bi knows how to treat their fans!",2
"great game good graphics if u like shooters get this",1
"does anyone know how or if you can change your player id? if i reinstall the game will this change or not?",2
"will no longer allow for conecting to friends servers",1
"you want a game where everything is close quarters combat? you want a game where you can see your enemy shooting you? you want a game where your health regenerates and youre able to survive several shots to the face? you want a game where the vehicles are extremely easy to operate and pretty much nearly invincible? you want a game where the guns are easy to aim and you need absolutely no experience to use them? you want a game where the map is nice and small and compact, and is perfectly practical to walk across? sorry. but this game is not for you. 10/10",2
"first time playing any iteration of the arma series, and i gotta say im loving it.",1
"awesome game, even more of an awesome group of devs. this game is amazing compared to arma 2. arma 2 was too clunky, i couldnt even run it. yet somehow i can run arma 3 even though it has way more advanced graphics and features. i really recommend this game while it is on sale.",1
"not untill they get all of the bugs out, other than that its a great game!",3
"its a really good game but i wish it was a bit cheaper",1
"yeah, its good. arma 3 has enough mods and game modes that you wont run out of stuff to do.",1
"arma 3 is probably the best war/tactical simulator. if you only want fast cqc combat, you are going to hate this. but if you like games like battlefield, your gonna love this!",1
"first time playing alits life i got ran over by a cop. 10/10",1
"as a huge fan of arma 2, i really wanted to like this game. i knew it would have a rocky release, but its been over a year now, and this game still feels incomplete. of course its poorly optimized, has sli issues (my pip wont even work with sli), and is very cpu-intensive, but thats only the beginning of my frustration with this game. issues from arma 2, like the horrid vehicle physics, are still prevalent in this game as far as i can tell from having my apc rolled over by a pickup truck. the fatigue and weapon sway debate aside, this game still clearly has problems and is hardly a finished product *ahem $16 dlc that includes just 2 helicopters*. at this point, ive just given up on bis, and dont see them fixing this game any time soon. that being said, i have had enjoyable moments with this game, but just not enough to compensate for the amount of technical issues the game has. tl;dr: would not recommend to a fan of previous arma games, or anyone for that matter.",2
"i love this game! ive been playing multiplayer a lot there past couple of days. if you are looking for a real military simulator this is the game for you. when you find players that will join a group with you and take the game seriously it is tons of fun. this is nothing like call of duty or even battlefield. i would recommend this game.",1
"only game i really play on steam now. highly recommend getting it if you like realism in games",5
"most fun game that uses realistic game features, tho not everything is ultra realistic you will still love this game 10/10",2
"excellent sandbox simulation, but unlike others i will not say it is a total military simulation. vehicles and aircraft and their controls, pathfinding, etc. need vast improvement for this to even be considered a survey sim. however, arma 3 is an excellent infantry simulator and the vehicles and aircraft used as a supporting cast are sufficient. thrown in the community mods, game modes, and missions and nothing can beat arma 3. i just wish the grass was not so cheesy looking when you crawl though it, and the graphics were a bit more cinematic. i guess one cannot have everything.",1
"very fun tactical shooter always loved the arma series",1
"amazing game really fun to play with friends! lots of different game types to play so its hard to get bored!",3
"i simply have nothing more to say than that this is the most fun i have ever had in years. i got very addicted to this game in so very little time to where the point i got over 30 hours in the first week of playing and i am still playing the game for 3-5 hours a day. 10/10 would pay $60 to play, or if you get it for $30 in which i did, still 10/10 would pay $30 to play.",1
"didnt bring much to the table in my own opinion, but the addition of more modern controls and the addition of newer smoother animations makes it a nice upgrade from arma 2",1
"great game fun and action packed a must buy if you like fps and having some fun in altis life",1
"the game crashes to often i cant even get to the multiplayer menu. they need to fix that soon",1
"aww yeah , with the mods and all the addons this is 100s of hours of game play if not more",2
"very good war simulator game, no easy peasy bf/cod stuff. good graphics, good sounds, large map, alot of game modes and mods, the realism on the bullets etc. absolutely awesome on invade gamemode as being dropped on 2-5km away and after that have to silently get on the objective, the communication of the team and cas. only thing that is bad is the performance on multiplayer, some bugs on the doors and inside the buildings and stairs.",2
"gameplay if fantastic, maps are fantastic, missions are fantastic, wasteland is fantastic, mods are fantastic, rp life sucks. 8.5/10",1
"arma 3 is possibly one of the best military simulation games i have ever experienced. pros: - wide variety of gamemodes - friendly and (mostly) mature communities - multiplayer allows some crazy fun times with as many friends as you can get together - performance is quite good for most instances (see cons for exceptions) cons: - performance in big cities with a lot of players suffers heavily - physics can be a bit derpy in some instances, and result in death - desync! do some research on it, however it is an arma thing - your social life will slowly fade away when you play this game overall: i would easily recommend this game to sandbox/shooter game lovers.",2
"great game! nice graphics and much better fps than arma2.",1
"best military simulation ever! if you are a cod player, i have bad news to you. worth every penny!",1
"awesome graphics and plot but games playability is very low. controls are very hard to use. you can not change them in the way you choose. it is the worst game i ever played for 4-5 years. really annoying just because of controls. there are universal keys like t for chat or y for team chat, they are totally different. and another problem is that bohemia uses the same strategy for their other products like dayz. another not recommended game for me.",1
"a fantastic game! its still in his alpha but its completely fantastic. its worth those 25 bucks you pay for it.",2
"this game is such an improvement from arma 2, its graphics are amazing and it is well optimized. it is well worth the price and has many cool features and multiplayer gamemodes which is a normal thing for any arma game. i played 1 episode of the campaign, it seemed ok but the multiplayer is where its at with this game!",1
"a great game that you dont see anywhere else. thank you bohemia interactive for making this great game and continuing to update it. k",2
"ive just started playing arma 3, and ive just played out the whole bootcamp, so i now know the basics. i think that its a extremely fun game, even though i havent tried out the multiplayer yet, but from what ive seen from gameplays i think it will be great! for those who want totry some real combat secenarios outside the bootcamp (beggnienrs) i would really recommend scuba, which was a exremely fun gaming experience. note thogh that i havent played all the showcases yet.",1
"best military simulation right now. not the best game engine (needs good cpu), but very rewarding and much more in dept and challenging than cod or bf. i really like this games and all the mods it has to offer from the great community. most fun for me is being gunner in a big tank, flying a jet or cleaning towns on foot with teammates. recommend for everyone that likes playing in a team and has some friends to play with.",2
"such a good game, drove a hatchback into a chicken wire fence, flew 100ft in the air then blew up. satisfied dont even need a $1000 pc to run it anything works even a normal dell pc.... great game very good :d",1
"plenty of fun mods and gameplay, i would enjoy playing this with anyone.",1
"is arma 3 for everyone? no arma 3 is a military simulator with more emphasis on realism than action or fun. those who enjoy the experience will find it incredible, but i would recommend doing some research beforehand to make sure the game is right for you. the good: - incredibly detailed open world-style maps - wide range of weapons, vehicles, and equipment - incredibly powerful editor and high mod compatibility with a large community always creating new content. - top notch graphics that will strech even the most hardcore gaming pc the bad: - very high system requirements, dont expect to get a good frame rate without a decent system - network issues can be an issue from time to time - though much improved over arma 2, the character movement and vehicle handling can be clunky and a bit glitchy at times. overall i would say arma 3 is a very good game that will continue to only get better over time as the community and the developers create more and more content. however, if youre on the fence about it, make sure you do some reasearch before jumping into this title.",2
"this games engine is 10/10 in singleplayer, but once things go to multiplayer, everything goes to hell. after 417 hours im pretty much done with it. sick of the lag and desync issues on every server i play on. i have a fiber optic internet connection, and i7 4770k@4.6ghz, 2 r9 280xs in crossfire, and 16gb of ram. the game is also running off a ssd, that is solely dedicated to it. and yeah blah blah blah, its arma and its always ran bad online, but its only worth putting up with for so long. no weapons have been added to the base game since i bought it, there was one helicopters dlc that was okay. this games main selling point is mods, yet running mods on an already desyncing and laggy mess does nothing but make it worse and further the unplayability of it. so, until the multiplayer is at least being worked on to improve framerates, im out.",3
"an in depth game about; what else? military combat and war. i love arma 2 but this one expands on that and then some. 9/10",1
"i really really love this game but i cannot play the new campaign! *spoilers* i cannot play the mission in which the player and his squad return to maxwell after it has been deimated by aaf. when i try to start the next oe, it simply says two hours later. the two hours later fades away but the mission itself never starts. this is extremely annoying for me and i know its just my game not everyone elses but if anyone knows how to fix this could you reply here? thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"its a pretty, and awesome game, highly recomend it!",1
"great game, great graphics, great gameplay, great combat and great to play with friends(that i dont have)",1
"if socom navy seals (ps series), just cause, and battlefield (of old) had a baby that baby would be arma. some of the things ive done on this game cant be duplicated anywhere else. this game is amazing, teamwork is essential as is a mic imho. take the time to bind your keys to get the best out of the game. i havent had this much fun in an fps in a long time (halo ce/goldeneye days) i got this on sale but if i could over again id pay retail without hesitation. this game is as timeless as skyrim in my eyes, its got mod support and the zeus addon that would add hour and hours of gameplay.",1
"for those who have played arma series, are passionate with military sims or are enjoying the lengthy(but worthwhile) process of winning, this is the game id recommend. although flight is not as good as the dcs, arma is a well-made simulator(thats right, it is not an arcade game)that simulates all sorts of experiences soldiers do during their line of duty. even if you dont mind your incompetent ai partners/subordinates, sp can be daunting; ai foes are definitely, even ridiculously, smart so you can be shot dead even if you make every precautions to prevent.(too bad our partners are not as smart). every variables must be accounted for executing a simple task. for those who just wanna play this game in a casual way, id really like to remind you this: you cannot be rambo, master chief, or cods protagonist or whatsoever to be winners, in arma. you are much more vulnerable than any of those mentioned heroes. you are in a virtual battlefield, you cannot beat foes unless they are really incompetent, un-coordinated bunches. regardlessly, for those who really want to experience what being a soldier feels like, id recommend this game. life is never easy, neither is this game.",1
"great gameplay, great visuals, sounds, and the two new islands are frankly wonderful and huge. in my opinion the most noticeable improvement since arma 2 is that we are now evolving into some realistic and visually credible open world, as opposed to the narrow places kinda looking like more or less similar checkpoints in previous games. the gameplay adjusts extremely well to the new terrains, making arma 3 something closer to an actual simulation than just an advanced fps with milsim elements into it. however, it is impossible to talk honestly about arma 3 without telling what hurts most: the lack of vehicles (planes notably, but not only), the lack of weapons and few annoying ai pathfinding issues (sometimes even on places where all should normally go well). that being said, i personally can see an insanely great potential behind arma 3, and the way it will continue to evolve will in my opinion probably make it simply one of the best game ever created. all it needs is some more time to grow up.",5
"life-like graphics and immersion would give any veteran ptsd. this game will turn anyone into a adrenaline junky instantly. the realistic gameplay and balistics are punishing, but at the same time very rewarding. this third installment of bohemias army simulator set in the near future on an existing island offers tactical gameplay and is enjoyed best playing in a squad. although lone wolfing can be done your survival chances will be smaller. the base game includes access to multiplayer mods like battle royal, wastelands, king of the hill, altis life and breaking point. high replayability value and a mission editor for those who like scripting all makes arma3 worth your money. requires a mid-high end pc to run properly. the gameplay can be slow. some mods dont run as well as others and suffer from desync. it has a few bugs and glitches, though nothing game breaking ive experienced so far. the movement can feel clunky and the controls/keybindings may take a while getting used to as there are just so many. i would reccomend arma3 to anyone who enjoys a serious militairy simulator.",1
"its good if u have at least one person to play with and even better with more. may take a little while to learn controls but the essentials arent that complex. there are some missions to help u understand how to play though.",1
"fun and realistic combat simulator. strong lurning curve but when you start to learn it, you can have alot of fun. i strongly recommend to people who like realistic games.",1
"as a military sim, its unbeatable. however, its most fun played as a roll around and blow and   up simulator.",1
"i cant say enough good things about this game. mil-sim with pretty engine. and finally a good campaign...",4
"fantastic graphics great simulation bad physics (better than arma ii though) good multiplayer some fun dlc and easy to give many hours of your life to this game in one go. campaigns are okay multiplayer is great... weapons are well modeled and the tactical simulation of this game is great especially online unless you get that one 12-15 yr old that wont leave the god damn black hawk alone and kills everyone constantly and ignores all administrators while wasting game slots... great game recommended.",1
"awesome game. great amount of mods and mission types",2
"as buggy as the beta still is (as youd expect), this game has been more fun and engaging than any other new game ive played in the past 3-5 years. i almost never get to say this, but i am actually looking forward to the full release.",2
"this has got to be the most challenging, strategic, and fun game on the market. if you like using your brain to get yourself out of seemingly impossible situations then this game is for you. the first campaign mission was not as fun but as the story develops the missions get better and better. the game is also absolutely stunning and looks like a movie at all times.",1
"shot down a helicopter. crashed on my whole squad. mission failed. 10/10",1
"one of the best shooters being released this year.",2
"this game is broken. after a promising few minutes of playing the game continues to crash on me with no message. ive submitted reports to bi and been responded to with suggestions by bi staff, after saying the suggestions did nothing and other users joining the thread to report similar problems it would appear we are now being ignored completely by staff with no further responses on the postings. worst thing about steam is i cant take this crappy unfinished poor excuse for a game back to the store and demand a refund.",1
"the controls are doo doo, but with friends this game can be pretty fun.",1
"the best massively open world first and third person shooter i have every played. arma 3 makes call of duty advanced warfare and battle field 4 look likes child play. the amount of detail in all there helicopters, tanks, troop transports, characters, weapons, maps, lighting, effects, go-carts is overwhelming! sometimes when im flying over a city getting ready to para-drop into a hell fire of tanks and jets, i feel like im watching a hd action movie of the year! i dont what i love most about this game the most, might be laying in the grass on a hill a mile away from any conflict staring down my scope of my rifle calculating the wind and the bullet drop, then taking the shot. no game has every made me feel so rewarded when i complete a mission. amra 3 missions are not these 5 minute deathmatches there long fought out high action battles. also there map is so big its insane, and its not just one island, theres others that are insanely big, i cant even imagine how long it would take to go from one side of the main island to the other flying in a helicopter going over 200+ miles per hour. lastly very unique complex non-repetitive terrain. love it, care for it, buy it!",2
"this is a super realistic millitary based game. i mean whats not to love?",1
"a triumph of programming, this improves on the old in every way, looks ing fantastic on a good system, im sure i will spend many, many hours exploding, incinerating, and pink misting bad guys. slightly more modernistic gear and weapons, and the new large map is ing insanely huge. great job, bohemia!!!!!",2
"good hd arma game, really fun to play with friends",2
"great game! still a few bugs in it, but it works fine. perfomance: 7/10 (compared to arma ii) graphics: 10/10 (great graphics! i love the pip function) sound 3/10 (jsrs 2.0 recommended)",2
"downloaded on steam free weekend,however was unable to join any servers due to failed connection.enjoyed what limited campaign there was,yes still buggy but expected...",1
"ive got to say, arma 3 is one of my favorite games. the base game is fun by itself, but the real fun comes in when you play wwith mods. arma 3 provides you with wasteland (survival teambased mode), altis life (an rp), breaking point (working dayz sa), and multiple more. this vast amount of solid content shows how good of a game it is.",2
"this game is great and i highly recommend it to players wanting a war sim or people wanting to shoot people. this game is massive and has tons of game modes to play online. the single player is more or less but still good.",1
"i wouldve gotten more enjoyment out of burning the 25 than by buying this buggy, laggy, always-35-fps-max-no-matter-if-settings-are-on-low-or-on-ultra, looking like crap piece of .",1
"this game is the best peice of junk ever. it has so many glitches and its so broken but no one gives a  because its so damn good.",2
"went on an altislife-server,started farming peaches,got run over and called a  10/10",1
"first off this war simulator for me is probably the best.the graphics are great even set to the highest setting.i personally have found no game problems which is great.i have five of the arma game series and arma3 and arma2 are my favorite.i hope in the future they make arma4.",1
"with a big community behind its a must have for every fps fans",1
"this is a dayz ripoff game pls rate my review so i feel kool",1
"i honked a horn at my enemy and he honked back in team deathmatch. 11/10 would play",1
"i love this game. its like battlefield and thats my favourite game so that means i will love it. you do need a good pc for it but i might be making a gaming pc so then this game would be perfect. over all this game is in my top 3",2
"good game, very differnt from arma 2 i do recommend playing with the settings for a good 15 minutes and you can get the game looking very sharp and not bloomy, highly recommend this game there is a gamemode for everyone online",5
"amazing game! especially if you play with other people and use teamwork! i havent had this much fun on a game in a very long time! :d",1
"abundance of possibilities, consistent gameplay, ongoing development and a great campaign make this game the mostplayed in my steam library. i would definitly recommend the purchase!",2
"if you like super realistic, first person shooters, this is the game for you!",1
"not anyting like the fps your use to. its much better! if you are looking for a fast paste fps this is not for you! requires a bit of your pc, but some commands can help run it a bit better!",2
"yes totally reccomending this game the campaign may suck but the online! love the vitual reality with customizable charcters with 1000s of combinations and a great selection of guns! what i didnt like: de-sync in online (de-sync is where a character glitches or objects in game causes lag usually items disappear or you will die) great mechanics. if you really want a simulator (military) this is the best youll find nothing better then what you see here. pros virtual arsenal training grounds great mechanics cons de-sync minor lag by far one of the best fps games ever cod is stupid now you will never go back",1
"a crazy amount of single and multiplayer content just like arma 2 but way more responsive with some new welcome additions to the already immersive experience. if you like massive battlefields and as close to real life combat this is state of the art!",1
"pile of , biggest waste of money ever. it should be illegal to sell a game as broken as this for 45 mother ing euros. 5/5",1
"an awesome game, lots of mods and missions coming out every day and just think, this game is still being developed with new things every day. 5 stars!",5
"i only really play over/e poch, and from my experience its a great game. you have moments when helis blow up for no reason, or you die to stairs but when you look past that, the skys the limit, to building bases, collecting weapons, starting firefights with your neighbours, or making peace treatys. this game is great.",1
"arma 3 is turning out to be a great game, with problems at the start which knocked my confidence it has now bounced back and is shining",3
"with the right mods and people, this is about as close as you want to get to actual combat [at least for the ground warfare] armas best feature is the dedicated modding community, you can find a mod for just about anything for arma. the game simulates fatigue, breathing and pain effect, as well as weapon weight, meaning that there wont be anybody out shooting a sub machine gun with a long rifle after being shot in the chest at near point blank range. there is a pretty good balistic simulation for vanilla arma but you can find mods for very realistic ballistics. i love pretty much everything about arma except these two things, of course, nothing is perfect. the game requires a pretty powerful computer setup to run effectively, even with my nvidia 770 graphics card, larger battles decrease frames quite a bit. and finally, armas controls can be rather clunky at times, the stance/lean controls specificly. it can be a problem at close range where a real human could move much faster. overall- 9.5/10 definetly worth the price if you can run it and enjoy teamwork and tactical combat.",1
"jumped out of a chopper under heavy enemy fire, ran to a bush and hid, crawled to a rock for better cover, steadied breathing, eyes on enemy infantry through sniper sights, b*****d started running through woodland obscuring view, turned on infrared sights, accounted for gun sway and bullet drop, boom...headshot! 10/10",2
"arma 3 is one of the greatest games i have ever played. apart from being my 2nd most played game on steam, i have been completely astounded by the amount of accessable gamemodes and innovative rps that are playable. if you are not into army simulations, dont warry. arma 3 will have a gamemode suited for you. 9.5/10",1
"got tactical, about to drop into a city to help take the hill. pilot told us we were going to land, jumped out and we all crashed. 6/9 had butt in my nose.",2
"completely worthless game. textures dont load more that 100 feet infromt of you. controls are so unresponsive it is not worth playing. not even worth playing for free. this game missed its mark. all the nice landscapes and footage you saw in the video was cutscenes. total marketing lie",1
"this game is a lot of fun but their anti hack protection battle eye is dumb as !!!! i got a battle eye blobal ban (banned from all sevrers) for having my cheat engine running on another ing game",1
"i play this game to get rid of an excess time and self-esteem i have. it pisses me off to immesurable means and i love it. if you hate yourself and your family you should pick up this game and try the brilliantly crafted wasteland mod where you will somehow manage to break your ankle and then your neck on a stupid ing rock.",5
"this is as real as it gets for war games. if your looking for a good realistic game this is for you 10/10.",1
"arma 3 and the rest of the arma series is best enjoyed with either a good organized and not so serious group or friends. since this game lives by its user created content there is an editor included that lets you create you own missions. let those be small or large, easy or tough, you are the creator. not to forget the steadily growing amount of user created mods. this game is a simulator (sometimes for walking long distances), so do not expect any arcadey gameplay, you get shot, you may live and treat your wounds or you may die instantly. tactical thinking is the key here and running head on is mostly the wrong thing to do.",3
"its a fun game but they need to fix the ing arma 3 altis live. they need to make it so you dont loose all your gear when you die i hate ing spending thousands for gear then a min later i fall off a small lip in the street and its all ing gone...",1
"still runs like a big pile of poopydoodoo. single player campaign is not finished. feels like a beta but it is the official release.",1
"if you are looking for a real army simulator, then youre on the right place arma 3 is the best army simulator experience you ever wanted with a good story line and the freedom to choose to do everything you want, there are no straight checkpoints, you aint going to be shooting at a enemy for 2 hours one bullit could kill you depends on where you get shot. this is straight away just the best militairy game ever made you have the freedom to do everything with the content creator. the only question you should ask yourself is.. why did it took so long to have this game!!! its worth the money. especially with online multiplayer on a big map with the freedom to do anything with anyone. see you in the battlefield!",2
"first off all there is no bikes like there was in arma 2 but this simulator is still fun",2
"1,000 hours of great fun, if you are going to get this game. try out alits life, maybe even try and be whitelisted to a3l. stealing a police bus, being chaced my 10+ cops cars, and having people sceaming at you in the back scared for their life of my driving. all real people sitting behind their computer screens. some of the best moments of this game. ps, gotta love bob the log. the only log that went down the river.",5
"i can write a review for it but i dont have it so it must be good. 10/10",1
"you fall over air and die when you are whering the crappy sandles they give you dont buy its a pile of dog poo.",1
"this is a must buy, amazing graphics, surprising fps, a ton better than arma 2, and even more amazing mods to be played, inlcuding the new zombie mod breaking point which is crazy fun.",1
"fantastic upgrade from arma 2, new lighting, animations and environment to name a few of the updated features make the game a dream. very fluid and vibrant, takes you into a futuristic war set however with the amount of modifcations available time-frame and setting varies. amazing level of access to scripting allows anyone to modify missions and the game in general to a tailored state.",1
"i decided to play altis life. i ran 20km to buy a car. i drove 14km to pick some apples. i drove another 14km to sell the apples. i got fined $10,000 by the police for looking suspicous. again, i ran 20km to buy a car. i drove 14km to pick some apples. i drove another 14km to sell the apples. and then someone spawned in a dildocopter made of quad bikes and killed me. i rate 10/10 and my nan rates 9.1/10, but for god sake leave the man with the ing apples.",1
"the game seems ambandoned to be from the developers... has bugs and i cant find a multiplayer season with serious players to play. also a hell of the lag",1
"in my opionion i prefer arma 2 op arrowhead, however this game is more customizable with your character (always a good thing) and it is definatle more pretty than a2. if your into the growing futuristic modern warfare games, this is a great one!",1
"love this game its entertaining and keeps you occupied for hours, sometimes theres s on there but i can deal with them.",1
"nothing comes close to a milsim other than arma. flawless.",1
"yes, i recommended this game, but its not that great. this is only my oppinion, to me the game is ok i guess, but it has a lot of bugs. also, its not that fun. the game would be more worth it if it was about 25 bucks, but nooooo it has to be super expensive. yes the game looks nice but it didnt change at all from arma 2. (again not worth it) well, if your into this kind of game, go ahead and buy it, don t let me stop you. but if you are not that into super hard core serious games than i suggest you dont get it, its a waste of money.",1
"first impression - nice graphs, what i mean it is epic nice, on the other hand, hard to get familiar with inventory, selection stuff, but all in all it is worth price. ....so only few words about this awsome goodness. way better than arma2, if you think your computer cant handle this game. trust me it can, even if arma2 were lagging for you. :)",2
"love it though i will admit, it still needs working on, the biggest issue for me is the bug where your clips disapear apon logging back in while youre on dayz breaking point for this game. mod by the way not the stand alone.",3
"one of the most realstic game i have ever played everything about it works for example: +graphics are amazing +eventually 3rd and 1st person decent shooter +nice storyline +fun multiplayer somthing however wasnt so great was: -bit glitch (at times not alot) -missions last forever i would rate it 9 out of 10 and i reccomend getting it!!!!!!!!!",1
"easy to love, hard to master. best enjoyed with the highest fps your rig can manage. i suggest lowering visibility for largest improvement.",3
"arma lll bores me :| idk. i thought id enjoy it more than i did. i actually uninstalled it. i wont go into details why i dont like it because no two gamers are the same. i hope whoever pays for this overly priced game, enjoys it.",1
"brandon is silly for not buying this game. its a fun game. you can go diving, who doesnt want to go diving.",2
"dont come here if you like to rush things. ignore the worthless metascore. the power in armas longevity is in the ultra powerful game editor giving players the ability to custom design every aspect of the game, the missions, design/build weapons, anything you can imagine is possible in arma 3 and amazing directx 11 gfx. with arma editor, only your imagination is the limit. it is possible to simulate and relive just about any (tactical) situation imagineable. six to ten years from now, youll be playing arma. you will keep coming back to arma, long after you have completed and forgotten loads of other games. im a operation flashpoint veteran, the grandad of arma 3 that appeared in 2001.",1
"bought this game for the mods only! worth it 100%. br + breaking point = hours of fun.",1
"really good fun, plenty of mods/expansions & like the other arma games, will provide many hours of entertainment.",5
"great game takes lots of time of learn, but it is realy rewarding and is lots of fun!",2
"its a really good military sim. it kinda better then arma 2 but still have a little bit of bugs.. but, beisde that... this game suck! just kidding! arma 3 is where it is at! best military sim out there! keep up the good work, bohemia interactive! i love you for making arma! when, i first saw arma in a gaming magzaine.. i always wonder would i ever play this game. got a pc played arma 2 free version boom fell in love with it! three days later brought arma 2 and arma oa loved both of it. the mods, the game, the capaign, and etc! one i heard arma 3 came out! it felt like i was having an ! i was excited! thank you again, bohemia interactive. for making an awsome game like arma! i really hope great things will come out from this game in the furture. :)",1
"arma 3 is an a-ma-zing game! it offers a lot of gamemodes and that makes this game incredibly fun to play. over the past two weeks i have become addicted to arma (in a good way) :-). so, where are you waiting for? buy it already!",1
"overall the game play is difficult and focuses on real life accuracy making the movement mechanics very frustrating to navigate. unless youre driving a land based vehicle, youre going to find piloting any aircraft a complete nightmare. the game looks great but has a very small variety of weapons to choose from, which in turn makes for some pretty bland game play. the enemies are all crack shots and can hit you from miles away even if youre in a concealed, prone position. i picked this up during a sale recently and still regret the purchase. lesson learned. will be avoiding any future bohemia interactive titles.",1
"buy it buy it buy it. i  you not, this is one freaking awesome game!",2
"now that it is out of alpha, it had been a very pleasant experience for me. 9/10",1
"i tried to go down a slide. biggest mistake i ever made. thankfully there was a kind doctor nearby who saved my life from the evil creature that was the slide. notify the government, slides are lethal. and to think we let children play on them. science has gone too far i say! 10/10 for kind doctors who understand the dangers of slides.",1
"wait. i dont own this game. how can i make a review for it?!?! ive never even played it!",1
"ok, lets face the facts, this game is quite a bit of money, but it is totaly worth it.",2
"good , better than arma 2, but not enough weapons or vehicles.",2
"i really like this game but i only got to play it for the weekend i just dont have money to get it im not that welthy i wish someone could buy it for me but no one will so geuss ill have to save up for it d:",1
"i found this game a little confusing at first but once i figured out all of the controls and got the hang of it it became one of my favourite games! reminds me of operation flashpont: red river if you have the money for this game, buy it. its a must have!",1
"arma has long been one of my favorite modern military games. arma 3 started off rough but it is a very fun game for those who like that type. it is very satifying to play and the commuity of mods and addons is fantastic. the fact the game company allows so much modding is what makes this series great.",1
"what a great gem of a find, beats cod and bf put together!",1
"arma iii is a military sandbox objective based multiplayer game. now lets start with the + -big maps (about 250 square km) -weapon variety anything from pistols to lmg and caliber 50 rifles. -loads of armored trucks, helicopters and air planes. -character customization. anything from undershirt to helmets and armor vest. -excellent graphics. it looks stunning on ultra. now its time for the - -horrible fps(frames per second) which results in multiplayer sometimes becomes a frustrating chore. if you get above 20fps consider yourself lucky. -there is no introduction to the controls what so ever, and it takes a lot of time to learn all the moves. -the base player community is sometimes a hellhole to be a part of. -moving and dying animations can look awful at times. especially the dying animation. presentation: 2.0 graphics: 9.0 sound: 7.0 game-play: 8.0 lasting appeal: 7.5 overall rating: 8.0 now arma iii is a fun fps/third person tactical shooter but it needs a lot more work to be worth the current price of 44.99 euros.",1
"great game. very immersive and would highly recommend!",1
"this isnt a very detailed review but yea this isnt just another fps fast action game or another rts at all. if youre new to the genre its more like operation flashpoint if youve played that. if not its about as realistic to real life mil sim as you can get. you will die alot even, fire fights can be anywhere from several hundred meters away or up in your face. you will either love it or hate it",1
"good game, poorly opitimized, but its all about the battle royale. everything else is kinda meh.",1
"arma 3s features in comparison to the previous arma is sustantial. npcs no longer have extremely odd path finding patterns, and animations are much smoother. the recorded voices for commands and such are more lively and smoother. npc dialogue or qeued dialoge seems more in-tone with the situation. command voices for specific objectives run smoothly, and actually sound more pleasent. bohemia interactive really showed what they can do this time. 5/5",1
"bohemia really knows how to create a war simulation game, i have no idea how did they get a game to run smoothly on a bad computer. good job, best of 2013!",1
"my friend shot me in the foot and left me to die. 10/10 but in all seriousness, arma 3 is a beautiful game and is tons of fun. there is a lot to do with this game, from booting up the editor and having you and a group of friends do a mission, to helicopter flight practice. playing arma 2 with the dayz mod has really gotten me into arma, and i enjoy it.",1
"this game is ing amazing but the only thing is i got ing banned for having loads of money on altis life :( now i have to pay 35 to get it back",1
"best looking game of the year so far, not to mention great gameplay",1
"if you dont know what arma3 is already, youre doing it wrong. well, maybe not, but arma 3 is a serious walking simulator! the maps are mind blowning huge for an fps. if youre doing any combat and are in the air, dont eject without having a backup mode of transportation. the ai is something to be desired, but the mechanics of the game are great. ai doesnt really react as teams, mostly as units. however, they do surprise you every now and then. then you will get into random elite ai where they can take amazing shots at you. multiplayer is really what makes this game possible. the mods that are out there really enhance the gameplay. the weapons are something of the future, but not out of the realm of possibility. at least to our knowledge. 9/10.",1
"this game is amazing! i enjoy having the more realistic feel, while still maintaining the fun of murder!",1
"loved it! its a nice, opened world, and great graphic game. bohemia has yet again, blew my mind. when arma 2 came, i didnt like it due to lack of graphics and its complaintcy with the loot system, but they have helped it with arma 3. i cant wait till the people who made dayz start an arma 3 version of it :3. for anyone who wants to play it, its fun with friends, and by yourself, so have a whack at it and see what happens xd.",1
"it dosent let me play i when i get on it says no entry?",1
"arma 3 so when i saw this game for the first time, i thought that soon will release another excellent piece arma. however, the first disappointment was already in anticipation, as the extremely small amount of technology and absence campaign. but this disappointment disappeared when issuing the first chapter of the campaign was excellent and the new technique also appeared. but i will not criticize. i must say that the guys from bohemians are struggling and working hard to repair, etc. graphically its a big shift but a new engine this could offer more. the playing area is huge and real and opens new possibilities for mods. technical equipment and weapon was terrible at the beginning and the newly added equipment was broken but gradually improves and fixes. despite this, however, it is compared arma i and ii, step backward. personally, i think that would bohemia interactive could use a better future. on the other hand, however, the campaign is excellent, what more can i say. final verdict: arma iii is an improved forward, but it is incredibly untapped potential. if it bohemia interactive put in the time and dedicated technicians and armor, or even a new engine, so it would be something completely different, much better. 8/10",1
"not a fan of this game. i try to like it as much as i can, but the graphics and the sound are so off-putting that i usually just give up on it. maybe this time around with some friends i will finally be able to get into the game and enjoy it.",1
"compared to its predecessor arma 2 this game is lacking in all fronts. the animations show less attention to detail, the future-esque models and textures fail to be very inspiring and and there is substantially less content (for example many of the vehicles uses the same weapon models). however, a lot of this could be forgivable if it werent for the truly atrocious optimization. seriously if my $450 radeon hd 7950 from 2012 cant pull above 20 fps on certain multiplier servers their isnt much hope for the average gamer. i am in no way an exception to this, and you should expect to face these issues upon buying the game.",1
"negative reviews fueled by angsty console junkies pissed off that they cant hipshoot and bunny hop everywhere. if you really like unreal tournament style shooters, go play something else. if you think battlefield or call of duty is too hard core, this game will hand you your  and send you back to the forums crying. theres a reason some military groups use it as a training simulator. its not for punk kids.",1
"fantastic, but unfortunatly you need to find a good group to play with, but worth it all the same.",3
"an excellent military simulator, has a large learning curve and requires patience inorder to to become skilled at. like most multiplayer games, arma 3 works alot better with friends becuase it allos for you to have more coordination, which is a very important factor in arma 3. its fairly system intensive , but has gone through alot of optimiztion patches, but you should still look into the system requirements before purchasing. i would highly reccomend it, especially if you have friends to play it with.",1
"i used drugs 10/10 this is a very scary game a helicopter came down and burned my eyes out and i died",2
"if they stopped making  dlc, and actually put the overpriced dlc helicopters into the game as stock vehicals the game would be great. oh did i forget to mention the  optimization? great game, great concept. just fix your buissiness model bohemia. you are trying to become like a aaa game like cod with dlc with barely any content left and right. i know you are better than this bohemia! arma 4 is probably going to be the next call of duty. they seem to be straying away from mil sim.",2
"amazing game. greatly simulated weapons and many features. very realistic, good story far as ive played, good controls, voice acting, and splendid views and graphics. definitely recommend it for any fps/tps fan!",1
"biggest waste of cash in a long time. so poorly optimised that i can hardly get over 6 fps, and i know for a fact that the issue is not my computer. would certainly not recommend until bohemia optimises this game, although, judging by arma 2, that may never happen.",1
"this game is brilliant but has decent system requirements. i cannot play the game on high settings however i can still enjoy it regardless. if you are the kind of person that wants to have the capacity to create an infinite variety of scenarios for yourself as i am, this is a great game to play. the game is difficult and brutal, you can freely make your characters look like a civilian or a hardcore military operative. you have a staggering amount of freedom in this game and lots of strategic options involving vehicles including atvs, helicopters, tanks, and even uavs. the maps are extremely large and the game does not fail to deliver on any point.",1
"quite good once played yopu get the hang of it but if you like war and have a great pc get it",1
"good simulation game. but what the  with these dlc, 7 weapons 12?! 3 helicopters 12? have you been bought by ea bohemia?",1
"this game is almost the perfect pc game (in my oppinion) however it would be great if the game ran a little bit better but apart from that you can mod the living  out of it and spend hundreds of hours playing the various life mods! 12/10 - me :d",2
"what i played seemed vastly improved over 2 (in that it feels like an actual game) but the pad input (i know you couldnt do everything on the pad anyway) still is ok but not great and the price seems high still for a game released over a year ago now (bi seem to be doing a activision methinks) so maybe ill bite (played free weekend) when its more in line with other game pricing.",1
"figured out how to use the new firing positions. then figured out you could use them to break dance. 10/10",2
"vanilla arma 3 is alright, but ive found it to be better with mods from both the workshop and armaholic. ive got in total about 30 monds that run everytime i play. i do however dislike the fact that they went all futuristic with the guns (the mx series is based on the acr) leaving it up to the modding community to devolope mods that add in better guns :)",1
"yesyesyes - i need this! tried it for the free part and it was awesome! tons of things to do and the showcases were cool, just watch out because its very cpu intensive and is more single-threaded. sorry amd fx cpus",1

"fantastic game although i lag too much too enjoy even though i exceed the system requirments",1
"first off, there is not at all as much content as there was in arma 2. now that thats out of the way, arma 3 sports amazing graphical settings, beautiful terrain, and well modelled vehicles, weapons, and everything else. if you want to mess around in the editor, and do god knows what else, arma 2 is where you want to go. if you want to make good missions taking minimal time and effort while still making an experience that sets itself apart from others, arma 3 is the game for you. reccomending this game really dependson how you want to play this game: a pro, or a playful guy who likes to crash a helicopter into his friends. if youre the playful guy, go to arma 2.",3
"drove a car over chicken wire. car broke. 10/10 would drive over chicken wire again",2
"outstanding the amount of detail its dust amazing also the grate multiplayer i love huge multiplayer games and this is one of them dont have anything else to say 10 out of 10",1
"i was impressed with the quality of the alpha and beta releases. cant wait for full release next month!! workshop support as well!! tons of replayability with community made missions.",3
"fun, great community, plenty of mods to keep you entertained but this game is expensive, its a stretch whether its worth 60$ imo but its very fun would buy again if it got cheaper",1
"storyline is  (like every time) but multiplayer experience has no end. i love the editing in this game it gives you so many options. alot of community made missions are the most played by everyone like wasteland, altis life, etc. i also love it so much cuz its set on my country :3",1
"once there was a soldier fighting for his life. he was a veteran that had been in many wars in arma 2. until one day there started a totally new war. a war that the world never had seen before !. something unknown but yet so fascinating that it someday would become a part of the human history. the new chapter of arma 3 a war that will never end. a war not so difference from our lives as the real humans of the world. but everything have to come to an end. so now it is up to you ! and only you to decide which who shall come home to they families and, who we will never forget as the fallen heroes !!!..",1
"ive only played it for a few minuets..(lol) i really dont play much else. very good game! extrmely long learning curve if youre new to arma in any way.. bye bye cod & mwf.",5
"i got this game thinking it would not even be worth my 22 euros. but hell i was wrong, another great game in my library if i get bored.",1
"i literally bought this on sale two days ago for $35. wtf steam",1
"a very good fps/thirdperson shooter game. perfect for rp and much more. 10/10 best you could get:d",1
"there are so many mods and gamemodes for arma iii that there is no way to do it all. my favorites include battle royale (a hunger games pvp mod, sort of), altis life (heavy rp) and wasteland (pew pew!). its hard to recommend any game for $60 because almost no game is worth that, but thats what i paid for this one and i have certainly gotten my moneys worth in memories since.",1
"its a great game for every one to enjoy it can be lay back and fun, hard and challenging, great fun if your in to militery shooters or you could play altis life a layed back causal life simulator. please ignore my spelling its 4:25am",1
"this game is unique and has many bugs but extremely enjoyable and there is plenty to do to keep you busy.",3
"arma 3 is a realistic military shooter that is part of the arma series (is it really?). the arma series has been around since 2001 and since then it has been improved greatly. arma 3 is a great game for people that are looking for a milsim (military simulation) game that has all aspects of war/military such as air (helicopter, jet, uav), infantry, armour (tank, aa, etc), water (boats, submarine). the arma series is known for having a really strong modding community, this is thanks to the support and the encouragment from the developers of the game. there arent really many problems with this game and the few problems that it does have dont really affect gameplay and if a bug is found the community generally makes it know really quickly helping the developers find the problem and fix it really quickly. with all the bugs getting fixed so quickly and the problems with the game being so small this leaves a great amount of time for the developers to add more to the game making it greater. overall this game is really fun and really intresting and you cant really run out of things to do with all the mods that are made for the game (epoch, a3 life and more). the arma series is also the origination of the dayz game.",1
"top graphics, full mission editor, variety of multiplayer game types, loads and loads of mods and user content, and a fricken huge map. nothing more to say really but its awesome :)",2
"one of the most engaging and expandable (workshop, mods, gamemodes etc.) shooters of our time. well worth it.",1
"arma 3 offen used as a combat sim for clans can be boring and demanding but the game itself is great the game looks and feals like an open world combat game, with that being said the community behind it are very much the weakist link in the game modders clans and servers all think they own the game they like to play i am higher ranked then you! moders dont code in the best way they can and then lie about what the games engine can and cant do, there are fine pepole out there playing this game but mp is as with every other game full of pepole you would like to punch in real life. is it worth the money? for single player alone this game is worth it and mp/mods are the 2th best thing in the game if you liked arma 2 you will also like arma 3. arma 3 is only an upgrade to the already great arma 2 new maps and content leave this game fealing freash and new. the one thing i hate the most about the game is the fact that it is based on prototype tanks planes atc they are not real! and this leaves the game fealing like a peace of the future not what i like imo",1
"war is fought by soldiers not the gun, it is fought by a ing tank coming down a road while you have youre pistol of doom. ps no pants have been harmed in the making of this game",1
"when operation flashpoint came out in 2002, i was pleasantly surprized that the bohemia interactive studio creators of the game managed to finally make a military simulation that surpassed all other competitors. i still play it, but its successors, arma, arma2, and now arma 3 take this sim to new heights. as a us army combat veteran, i can state from my military experience that arma 3 tops the list of all fps sims to date. arma 3 involves teamwork, self-discipline, and developing strategy to defeat the enemy. this sim is not for run and gun players.",1
"what more to say? coming back to this from a few years away and its great to see how its developed. being a fan from arma, arma 2 and even vbs 2, you cant go wrong with checking this out. but there are conditions: you have to love the milsim side of life, you can do anything. you have to persevere also. you will die. again and again... this game will suck you in. big time....",2
"arma 3 is not another brain-dead shooter, this ones got both beauty and brains! not bad for eastern europe",1
"awesome game. great amount of mods and mission types",2
"better combat than arma 2. now are the guns better? yeh, attachments make them better. do they handle better? well, id argue that the damage system and how bullets flyed was better in arma 2, and that people move too fast when jogging in arma 3. but then again, people still play battle royal and koth in arma 3 so yeah, arma 3 is better.",1
"if you cant get a head shot from 200 meters with iron sights, avoid because evan on the easiest difficulty, the ai can.",1
"wanted to like it. tried to like it. i just cant get into it, or the arma 2 games. too tedious and annoying. all water under the bridge, but i would like to have back all the money ive spent on the arma series.",1
"so. this is one of my favourite games of all times, since arma 1 and cnc commanders was released. people are complaining about the missing campaigns, being impatient and just douching all over the place because its not a cod. this game is just like the best milsimulator ive ever played, right after arma 2 oa. bohemnia interactive did a very fine job. it has bullet penetration. the soldiers are highly customizable and damn... it is even supporting mods and encouraging people to create stuff. if you want a real multi-player and fps capable game, please buy this. its just amazing. graphics and gameplay is o-u-t-s-t-a-n-d-i-n-g. arma 2 needed an additional mod, called ace, this game here, does not even need any more realism mods, because it is realism itself! worth the money. fun to play. 9.5/10 -acekiller.",2
"really good game if youre a hardcore gamer and have patience and like teamwork. also very realistic",2
"one of the best sim game i have ever played. can be slow at times but once you get in the action it feels great",1
"i recommend this game!! it is already in beta!! :d",1
"battle royale is the best! very good mod. (the game is ok too :p ).",1
"awesome game.the graphics are so nice and the gameplay is so smoth",1
"im a huge fan of the series (since the good old operation flashpoint), but now im hugely disappointed by what public multiplayer has already become! arma was a military simulator aimed for those who like the genre, 90% of public servers today are rpg. for me altis life is the plague of arma... there needs to be a forced filter to remove them from the server browser. to get that real arma experiance nowadays you need to play with friends or join a group/clan... no way to get the real arma experience on public servers. (sorry for my poor english)",3
"im not going to give detailed information but its good. 10/10 on good computers 8/10 on crappy (mine)",1
"better than arma 2. not so ing buggy. but still, a very nice game. i have 200 hours on this piece of . its very fun to slide on my  and shoot. i think call of duty advanced warfare should have the should  slide feature in it. overall i give this game 9.999999/10.5 .",2
"this game is far too clunky to even be considered a full game in fact this should be in alpha. the controls are ok but the arma engine just makes it feel unnatural like everything is not smooth at all. the spotting system in this game is totall  by the way. you and your friend could be hiding in deep weeds but if an enemy gets within 50mt from you then you appear on their map, ripe for them to then kill you completing invalidating close up stealth. the game also has hit detection problems, i had the iron sights pointed directly at an enemy a bour 75 mt away and i could see the dust of the bullets hitting behind the enemy. overall i wouldnt get this game for full price, possibly 75% off if you want to play with friends because playing with friends does make the game a little better.",1
"this game is just wonderful, it is beautifully done, very good and magnificent. it is a bit hard to play, but not as hard as arma 2. so i recommend this game for everybody and seriously, you should rather buy arma 3 than arma 2. :d",1
"jumped in, noticed theres no team deathmatch, free-for-all, then realised it was the final product, sadness...saw battleroyale, won my first ever arma match, second time, a guy in a pedo van, runs me over, i cant stop laughing. recomend 101% - nastyign - 6969",1
"this game has some twitchy movement and bad controls. the frame rates are buggy and graphics are just meh. reminds me of a lackluster counterstrike. not worth the money in the least.",1
"it`s a good game if your computer has a great graphic card and etc. with the steam workshop, it`s really awesome, like with dynamic zombie sandbox. its really fun, with friends, and can be a challenging gameplay. from missions to survival game modes or just some good old classic tdm`s/dms. its a great game, ill give it a 9.5/10.",1
"the best war game ever made just got better :) buy this asap",2
"loved the arma 2 and am loving this even more, great game and has lots of modabilaty",2
"many fun can get 5 fps at everything low would play",2
"it is the best military game i have ever played in my live.",1
"nice work dreamworks studios, expensive and fun shooter.",2
"excellent combat simulator, the game is much better with a squad and you can achieve a lot more within the game. !!!game is not made for slow pcs check the requirements!!! 7/10",1
"i would say you guys should get this game as it is quite a fun game to be on with all the different modes from zombies to hunger games. also its a great co-op game aswell",1
"worst game i ever bought! my little pony is even better!",1
"i do recommend this game. not only for what it is but for what it will be ad its posibilities. it is just out of the scale!",1
"if you liked arma 2 you will love arma 3, the stock standard game is ok but if you want the best experience then you will have to download a few mods to really make it somthing to remember.",3
"worth a buy. so many mods you cant even imagine. you need a goofy pc for this, but once you are in, and the fps is good, you wont leave the game.",1
"it is an ok game(arma 2 is better) but the reason it is not one of my favorites is because of one reason!!! no nudity 3/10",4
"a beauty of a game if your computer can run it. it has lots of strategic possibilites and can be played for hours with the addition of the steam workshop.",1
"the best installment of the arma series so far. laggy gameplay seems to have been fixed to the great extent, interesting and intensive, dramatic single player campaign reminds the original operation flashpoint times. recommended for all tactical warfare simulation fans.",1
"this game is worth way more than $60. when i buy a game i think that every dollar should act as an hour of fun, i have over 150 hours on this game and i do not plan to stop playing anytime soon. the free roam is better then anyother game i have played/watched. you can be anything... a plain rifleman, you can be a sniper, a diver, you can wear a ghillie suit and have silenced weapons, a drone operator, a tank operator, a platoon commander/squad leader, and so much more. there are also great community game modes such as: bennys warfare, king of hill, and so much more. this game will fit any kind of playstyle you have. the realism is truly amazing, the only bad thing: you need a good graphics card to truly experience the beauty of arma 3.",3
"this game is endless fun but has a steep learning curve.",2
"best game ever. make sure your 16 or older cause if your not you wont have friends.",4
"software is buggy, ill get stuck between water and land and have to restart the level. also, i can do 2 direct head shots and nothing happens but, the character can take a single hit anywhere and die; this is on novice. if i take a differnt path, the level gets hung, and nothing will progress unless the level....again has to be restarted. my team members will have super human powers and they take off leaving me in the dust, while my character never recovers from exhaustion. i understand they try to make this a realistic as possible to being a foot soldier but, i spend most of the time walking from one end of the map and back. i wish they did more r&d before releasing this and spent more on combat; i wish i could have my $ back.",1
"l love this game but the problem is l cant spot the emeny also how to aim but any way l love the game ><",1
"best gamemode to play is altis life highly reccomend this game. :()",1
"arma 3 has to be the best game i have ever played. it has one of the best communities possible and the amount of addons for the game is unreal. a must have!",5
"this game rocks, if u have not got it yet,your a fool",2
"i love the game but sadly my computer doesnt have the right specs to just play it for as long as i want ive only played for 13 hours/ 45 minute rounds because thats how long it lasts hopefully i can get a new computer and play this game as long as i want but other then that the game is great and really fun with friends!",1
"its a good game. though recommeded for people who like to take millitary shooters very seriously. otherwise the fun side its pretty",5
"really great game and i cant wait to put in some heavy hours",1
"was driving around with a friend in a car. drove off a small hill, and proceded to stop moving. asked why we had stopped moving. friend answered: we appear to have lost a tire walked 5km to the next objective. 10/10 would lose tire and walk to objective again.",1

"amazingly fun game, to the t milsim, awesome cummunity support with mods and epoch. bought it got 200 hr and had to buy it again for my buddy.",3
"its an alright game not as good as the past installments but it does bring some new stuff to the table; improved graphics , more stances and better running animations. dont think that they should have set it further into the future just wrecks the immersive factor. also contains loads of bugs and frame rate issues. i would recommend buying arma 2 and arma 2 oa first before buying this becuase the modding community has not backed this game enough and as far as i know they have not added ace/acre mod and a propper vietnam usung mod yet.",1
"arma 3 is one of my top 5 favourite games, it has 2 massives maps to play on. and millions of mod like breaking point, arma 3 life, battle royal and many more. overall this game is massively awesome so why not try it out?",1
"its so much fun look at my game time and you will see why this game is so much fun the only thing is i hate paying for add ons thats the only thing which holds it back a tiny bit by 1% game is 9.9 out of 10 really!",2
"great game. if you like shooters this game is for you! even if you dont like shooters, get it.",1
"this game has some twitchy movement and bad controls. the frame rates are buggy and graphics are just meh. reminds me of a lackluster counterstrike. not worth the money in the least.",1
"i thought this game would fix the giant mess it created in the last arma game. i was so wrong and i wasted my money on yet another stupid pile of crap. when you cant finish the tutorial because it wont tell you how to aim down the sight or tell you what the hell barring 220 is supposed to mean i give up and shoot the drill sargent. game deleted!",1
"great game;unlike the other  sims...my only problem with the game is that its fremerate is around 30 fps on multyplayer.by the way,my pc is pretty damm powerfull.",1
"unless you are a really, really big fan of the operation flashpoint lineage, avoid this. avoid it until they see their stocks plummet so far into the ground that they finally decide to get off their lazy  and fix this piece of  up. its been, what, two years now? its still a leaky piece of  with major fps and performance problems of which, mind you, 3/4th of these issues come from the original operation flashpoint. litteraly nothing has been done to remove any of these issues and it very obviously shows. only pick this up if you dont have any of the previous itterations, its exactly the same, minus a few gameplay tweaks.",5
"with the new zeus dlc, i honestly think that the future of rts is with this game. if you have the hardware to run the game its a must-buy, its the only pc game out there thats actually a full military simulator rather than run and gun fps.",1
"as close to a military sim you can get while still able to provide buckets of fun! the guns and vehicles feel nice as does the general movement. this great game is also bolstered by a bright and very dedicated modding community that has definitely improved the game itself! if you like something more hardcore than your usual shooters but still want to have some fun, this is a game to get!",1
"excellent, just absolutely excellent game. the possibilites and endless scenarios that you can create yourself just makes this games one of the best games of this genre, and possibly one of the better and more unique games for pc. unrivalled in creativity and possibilities, arma 3 is a masterpiece added to the genre. bohemia delivers, yet again.",3
"i really cant recommend this game in the state that its in. bare bones content. nowhere near the value for money or content that arma2:oa alone has. stupid, awkward release schedule and lifeless world and content. i wish i could get a refund.",1
"id  the  on this game any day of the week m8. almost onpar with victoria bitter so thats in sayin something m8. m8 play it and if you dont like it you are a in gypsy.",5
"really fun game, i found it difficult to learn all the keys tho",2
"a fun and addicting game for me. started with just the campaign then started playing the breaking point mod which is the arma 3 version of dayz. now playing wastle land and altis life. this game has a lot to offer and the community additions are great. i highly recomend this game if you are a fan of fps games that actually want you to use some tactics.",4

"well what i like about it is that it is a military simulator and that it has so many different game modes. but what i really hate about it is that the price is to steep. i would recommend lowering the price down to $30-$40 or somewhere in between for about a week. that would really boost sales and i know i will buy it.",1
"theres not much to say about arma, so many crazy stories come out of it. once me and two other friends were scouting around in some woods near some buildings, we were loaded up with weapons and some good backpacks. we spot a building we wanted to check for loot, except theres already about 3 or 4 guys in there from where we could see in the hills. so my friends decide its not a good idea to go down there, i had a grenade on me, i took off my backpack and left my sniper in one place (so my friends could take it for me if i died), took a grenade and a pistol. i launched the grenade high into the air where it exploded confusing the enemy, i went rambo into the building with a pistol and took all the guys out. so yeah.....10/10. get this game!",1
"the definition of a military themed sandbox game. part of a franchise that has been going strong since 2001, i have no doubt this newest installment will provide me and many others with countless hours of pure unadulterated fun!",4
"in modern war, you will die like a dog without any good reasons. the first thing ive learned in arma 3 online battle is surviving, not shooting, and that is what real war will teach you.",1
"awesome game if you like arma 2 you will love arma 3 despite the amazing graphics it plays pretty well and there is a ton to do. id say buy this game but at a risk of you may not be able to run it considering its such a cpu intensive game i hope you enjoy it like i have though have fun!",1
"fantastic game, as an arma ii player, seeing the new advances in armaiii is quite outstanding and provies for a more enjoyable expierence.",1
"i went online, ended up in a go-kart with a hmg on top, and then getting a nuke and exploding everywhere from hitting a small rock with a gokart. 10/10 gotay",3
"arma 3 was an outstanding continuation from its previous game arma 2, the things i love about this game is the sheer liberty to do what ever you want with limitless possibilities like flying a helicopter in races death matches tank wars sniping driving and even content creation, how could it get any better, cons: listen the game is absolutely amazing in perspective but there is a little bit of a let down, if you dont know already the amount of vehicles and weapons immensely decreased since arma 2, where is our hind f35 or even and f18 or at least a black hawk. so there you are that was my opinion on the game arma 3 yours sincerely, blaze 420xx",1
"very realistic, but doesnt run multiplayer at high frames.",1
"best game ever for me, and one of the reasons for me to start playing on pc",4
"is a good game and for life is not dont play arma 3 life rpg is so  play arma 2 life island have funn to see this  !!!!!!!!!!!",1
"arma 3 offers you multiple sandbox multiplayer missions and variety of large scale battle scenarios. bullet travel and weapon ballistics are quite reallistic so its not your standart battlefield game. big maps and large game modding community make this game really specia. 11/10 would play.",3
"im in love with this game. very good graphics and weapons i wish it was cheaper though",1
"when it works, its fantastic. when its broken, its infuriating. when its broken, its funny, and when it works, its boring. big game thats only going to get bigger over time with mods and new content from the community and bis alike.",1
"this game is so fricking amazing. graphics are probably the best",1
"this game needs a good pc but its worth getting one for it. being a sandbox moddable game its less of a game and a engine for tons of games. once you mod it has every option to play from super realistic (as much as a game could offer) to halo type games.",4
"recommended, really fun and completly enjoyable game! better buy while its played :d",1
"great game hope it does on sale for the christmas sale <3",1
"this is one of my most liked games the price is high but its worth it its realistic it has the best campain and muiltiplayer the sandbox,roleplay arm my favorite if you like dayz realisim this is another good game its based of off real islands and countrys i was one of the people to play as it was a alpha beta then the real deal they work on any bugs that you report and or hackers. it take them a while to make these maps because there really big bigger that skyrim and fallout and most other games maps i would consider this game as 5 our of 5 by theamericanchewtoy or terminalvelocitypcs :)",2
"personally i love this game. yes, it has a hig learning curve, controls are clunky and occasional bugs tend to happen. but with its great community with piles of mods and user created missions it may be the best military sandbox ever. i highly recommend that game",2
"the closest you will get to the real deals. lots of fun and depth",1
"wanna play a war simulator? arma 3 is the best! play with friends and have fun!",2
"got spawn killed by a man with a handgun, then he hunt me down just to take my clothes and dignity. 10/10 would play again",1
"with the right mods, this game can be extremely fun and tactical. the base future game is not to my tastes but arma will always have that tactical gameplay that brings me back.",2
"ive enjoyed arma 3 since alpha and its a great game.... ive spent over 400 hours on the game and id recommend.. the only bad thing is the terrible optimazation but over all its good!",3
"flight suposedly has hotas and rudder pedle support but you need to asign everything yourself and then the controll is eather jumpy or intermitently unresponsive. rudderpedles are usles 1/2 the time game thies to map stuff to trackir. ground many intreactive items spontaniously become non interactive. entering a veicle before being told to will caus mission failure. if your wallet is 60 dollars to heavy this is the game for you.",1
"you battleye, i got global banned for no ing reason? well  me. i cant ing play anything that uses battleye thanks to the head that set up the ban system, you think you have all the kinks worked out of the battleye thing, well you ing dont.  this , im out.",1
"what do you get when you add arma 1 and arma 2, thats right, . what do you get when the devs of those games actually try. arma 3, this game is actually fun as  and really nice looking, if you can run it at max settings. tking your friends is a big highlight.",1
"havent played much of the game but from what i have, i can definitely say id recommend it to anyone who enjoys fps war simulation games. the campaign will challenge you. there are an assortment of co-op missions and the game supports steam workshop as well as various other mods and added missions. the multiplayer is where this game shines. with several different game types that will keep you coming back for more. if you get bored of doing the usual from what this game offers you can join fun multiplayer game types such as altis life, battle royal, or wasteland. im not sure if i would have spent the asking price of this game; however, if you can get it on sale it is definitely worth around $30 for as much as youd get out of the game.",1
"best atmosphere ive ever played in. also quite realistic. thumbs up.",1
"i love this game, but i cant get arma 3 life mods to work , this arma 3 launcher just made stuff complicated !",1
"the most realistic military simulator (that is open to the public) that ive seen.",1
"love this game. too much content ,missions, and modding to even list just buy it now.",2
"if you like military simulation this game is definitely for you. although its just an alpha its already much better than any other arma title was on launch day.",2
"posibbly one of the most engaging shooter/simulators there are. loved arma, arma ii, and this is just an awesome game. couple that with the epoch mod or even the breaking point mod, and the game really does pay for itself. cant recommend it enough.",2
"unlike most games if you see somthing off in the distance you can go to it which is amazing",1
"to me, the best one of the arma series. ive just finished the campaign and i had lots of fun. military simulation (challenging gameplay), open world, campaign, multiplayer, large variety of weapons, vehicles and uniforms + mod support and ingame editor. last but not least: awesome graphics. a.i. can be a bit dumb at times. if youve played operation flashpoint: cold war crisis and/or arma 1 and arma 2 you already know what im talking about, allthough it already got much better in my opinion. definite recommondation, especially for fans of ofp and arma.",1

"i really like this game i like the gamemodes for multiplayer. i liked the singleplayer it was still fun, there are a few glitches in the game but i dont care that much because it is an amazing game and i will never regret buying this game i would recommend this game4 to everyone.",2
"i drove a jeep for 10mins to get to where the fight was. immediately after getting out of the jeep i died without even being able to fire a single shot. let alone spot the one that was shooting at me.",1
"completely unpolished game with an engine that runs poorly. expect crashes often and low fps on even the best rigs. down right terrible execution of a game/idea.",1
"dont get me wrong. i love arma 3. but the bootcamp update crippled the game for infantry. i know its supposed to be a milsim but honestly, i dont see how a trained soldier with a mainly plastic rifle, a few mags and the standard military garb cant run for more than 10 seconds without nearly dying of exhaustion. the ai apparently gains sustenance from the bullets you fire into their flesh and now take more than 6 shots to the chest to down, whereas your character will move like hes soiled himself if a bullet hits the wall 10m away. tl;dr: the editors good, the vehicles are responsive and fluid, but the stamina system is the worst one i have ever seen in a videogame. id recommend, but only if you prefer vehicle combat over infantry.",1
"playing this game like its my job. really fun, i would pay full price any day of the week.",2
"the broadest and most comprehesive military shooter available. if your willing to learn the possibilities of what kind of mission you create are endless. there are a few bugs but nothing is as open or accessable as far as doing what you would like how you would like. no handholding, and no invisible walls. this is a proper pc game, minimal priofit milking compared to ea, or activision. unfettered and not locked down. you want to lan, you can lan, no peer to peer served limited to 4 or 2 coop games, no locked server files. play with who you want when you want you want to make your own campaign, go for it. you want to make a mission type, go for it. you want to model a specific vehicle or weapon, its daunting but go for it. theres bugs, and valid complaints that havent been fixed like in any series, but this is the most consistently dev supported series available, i think arrowhead is still receiving updates. you wont see that from dice or any of the other big devs around. for utilizing the pc as its meant to be utilized alone, bohemia interactive should get your dollars. as far as gameplay goes think a smoother swat 4, with less emphasis on cqb.",4

"always a fan of the arma series and i love to support their games and continue to be a supporter for a long time. keep up the good work! <3",1
"awesome game to play with some friends, lots of fun but requires a good pc.",1
"terrible game unless you plan on playing it on single player only, major fps lag on multiplayer you will get 3 fps for ever even lowering all settings to low or disabled.",1
"amazing game. hours of fun played on this and many more to come.",4
"this game is pure amazingness it has a steep learning curve with learning how to shoot the gun properly to actually kill and enemy, but the curve is definitely worth its time",1
"this game just isnt fun. its too realistic to actually be realistic. things happen that would not be actually possible in a real war. this is a boring game, and there isnt a way to have fun. however, it is a good game if you want to really load your gpus capability.",1
"this has been out some time now, and like all the arma games before it the community just keeps adding stuff to it, which makes the longevity of the game and franchise even bigger and better as there are some really talented modders out there. if youve never played this game or even picked up a demo of this or any of its previous versions then i highly recommend it. if you like war games, both rts and tactical then this game is for you. its not a shoot and run type of game, and not suited to people who love bf and cod type games, this is more a thinking mans game. although the original game lacks any real campaigns or missions, there are plenty of community created ones out there free to download, some good and of course some bad. for those of you who like to design your own missions then dive in to the editor, there is plenty of help out there and the community is thriving and more than willing to help you start.",1

"glitchy. its been out for a long time and i finally got it but im not into it at all. love flying helicopters but maybe 20 minutes or so in, the flight stick is suddenly unrecognized and i have to restart. its infuriating. added to a whole other mess of glitches and lackluster multiplayer (for me anyway) and frustrating single player. ill rate it a meh. ill be hated for it, but thats okay.",1
"a great simulator game after arma 2 i think, its very realistic. i recommend this game for someone that love real war simulator games :d (y) keep it up, bohemia!!",1
"so realistic that it pisses me off and i love it :)",1
"a very fun and addicting game, the action and all the fire fights that happen make this game very intense. there is mulitple things you can do on the mulitplayer, such as playing with a team to eliminate certain places. the muliplayer makes the game a lot better.",1
"co-op is fun. 20 hours later, still getting used to it forsure. i played a lot of arma ii and enjoy them both.",1
"best game ive probably ever played? i would really reconmend this game if you got a mate its brillant, its great crack, lots of laughs not buggy and fun to play even if your serious about it",3
"great game, i have no problems with it really at all. 10 / 10 worth the money.",2
"best game ever, was on a rp server been playing for 40 hours on it and i got my first killed, he sent me a text mesage saying i should  my self i said to him you will be mine  and went to find him, after about an hour i found him and knocked him out and put him in my chopper, we flew off together and he asked what are you going to do with i said back there is lube in the back, get your self ready lets just say never to  with me",1
"this game is one of the best simulators i have ever played. it contains many improvements to the engine, graphics, and controls since arma 2. this game has been made better by the steam workshop to host a ton of downloadable senarios. i would recommend you play this game with friends, or some sort of community. some negatives of this game, is its performance, i requires a powerful computer to play, even then there is some sort of performace drop. also there was a lack of single player content, but there is now some being released. im looking forward to the future of this game as it gains popularity, and plus with all the cool expansions arma 2 had, there will probably be new content in the future. one more thing is that there is a huge difficulty spike because its a simulator. this is no call of duty or battle field, and requires alot of time to get used to. if you never had any experience with arma games and you are not shure if you should get arma 3, buy arma 2 + oa, it has been on sale recently for really cheap.",1
"this game is not worth it, stay with arma 2,  arma 3",4
"you know. this game is great! if you love flying helicopters and getting hookers!you will die to play this game forever! i know when i first bought it all i did was watch my guy sit on a rock! its like im watching a second me watching another person play this game watching a hooker inside a game inside another game! what im trying to say is... this game has hookers!!!! get it!",1
"this is my first review. arma 3 is one of the most realistic military sim youll play in awhile. the realism beats battlefield, but is slower. at first if youre not use to it you will wonder how you died. after awhile you will realize that you were shot around 500 meters away. arma 3 is for the players who want more realism than battlefield.the game has many positives and some negatives that i can note. positives: + amazing graphics in some places + big maps (2 really big islands, with one about 270km squared) +a decent amount of vehicles / weapons +alot of uniforms for player customization (using the virtual ammo box, that is present in some servers) + a very good editor and a real time edior named zeus + life like situations with other players + no annoying kids like call of duty negatives: - the campaign does not have a story that leaves an impression - the ai downright has no iq - needs a good computer - the map though big in some places are really just open land - hard to learn the game has its shares of positives and negatives, but will not be like any other game youve ever played. dont buy this game if you wont take the time to learn how to play. that is because it will overwhelm you if you perfer games like call of duty.",1
"i playd arma 2 then i died and the i called my friend dave and then",1
"unable to play with my friends in co-op. we could play on public servers together though (by joining them manually) but we couldnt play on servers created by one of us. we tried several tricks with firewalls and opening ports, connecting directly to server ip - doesnt work. maybe we actually could fix this on our own but were not with freaking nasa. bohemia probably thinks theyre very special cause i cant imagine why in 2014 i should freak myself out to find a way to play with my friends. i mean, its not even dark souls. game is great by the way, but its a special one. its not bf for sure .",1
"arma 3 is not a game you should pay $60.00 for. the game does indeed offer a few nice features but it does not offer the good, realistic, and tactical gameplay you would recieve from arma 2",3
"it is a fun game if you have a good pc it will be very fun for you",1
"if you see me playing this, im probably having the time of my life, so dont bug me.",2
"arma 3 is one of the best military simulators out so far i would recommend this game to any hardcore gamer because of the realistic situations and the way that bohemia have introdueced medics into the game rather than just recovering over time like in call of duty or battlefield. 10/10",2
"if you enjoy a real challenge for a shooter/ simulator then the arma series is for you, this is not your typical battlefield or call of duty shooter(arcadish). i highly recommend this game and the other bohemia titles!!",1
"arma 3 has great graphics and sound effects compared to arma 2. however, ive observed many gameplay bugs while playing multiplayer online. also, the arma 3 maps arent nearly as good as the original chenarus map in featured in arma 2. luckily they were able to port chenarus over to arma 3 which makes arma 3 a much better game. honestly, when i first bought the game right after release, i was not impressed by the altis map - it was too open and flat, then when the terrain changed, it had too many valleys. it would be hard for me to recommend this game to others because of the annoying multiplayer bugs, then you have to deal with battleeye problems which can either kick you back to your desktop or not let you connect to a server at all. arma 3 is a tough game to play due to its military simulation style of gameplay and therefore i would consider this game a serious pc game. console games cant get even come close to the fine level of detail for player movement controls. the keyboard and mouse rule over the gamepad controller for first person shooter games. esdf for life, not wasd. i play arma 3 online with a close group of friends and its very fun for chenarus wasteland.",1
"really do what this game so bad it is so good and worth it",1
"if you dont buy this game, (especially on sale) your an idiot!",1
"this game is so good, its just full of surprises. are you done downloading and completing the thousands of scenario missions? why not go online and play altis life, wasteland and king of the hill that require no extra downloads. enjoy the massive landscape you explore and the action that comes from within it. this game is greatly done, more expensive then the other armas, but completely worth it. r.i.p my productivity.",2
"a true military simulator that looks amazing and plays great when you get a hang of the unorthodox controls.",1
"this is just to recommend others like me... this is in no way saying the game is horrible. i understand its not a casual shooter, but coming from battlefield to play this? i know what people may say about my review of the game, but holy ... movement mechanics by far are too complex... i typically expect to use only the minimum amount of keys to perform movements, but what the ... i am not going to count the plethera of those required to perform different movements, but its some kind of high  number. i played the campaign as far as i could take and halted completely when it came to flying the uav... i took me about 10 tries until i gave up and shouted obsenities at my tv... every time i tried i flew it into a rock, a house, myself, and even into the ocean... tldr: i dont have the patience to play this, nor the appetite to constantly learn how to bind keys. if you are a casual shooter kind of person stay the  away from this. trust me... im pretty good at battlefield, but just terrible at this. (two different games completely) i guess thats what makes this game unique. pros? its pretty beautiful though...",1
"this game is a really well developed combat strategy simulator, it offers an immersive combat experience from the experience of multiple command element from squad to battalion. the game may have its quirks but for the most part they are resolved by mods and 3rd party created content. i have played the entire arma series on disc format and have not been disapointed. arma 3 is an awsome game but i simply dont have the buget to buy it at this point although i would recoment it to any individual looking for great combat simulator.",1
"although i only played the free weekend my experience with the game (king of the hill and altis life) was pretty amazing. my only problem with it however is the battleroyale servers because they are always locked during a match which can take a longf time so to improve this i would make an area so players can wait for the match to finish. i was kind of sad about this because that was one of my main reasons to play arma 3 but i never had the chance. thanks to gassy mexican for showing the game on youtube (and making me play it)",1
"really amazing game that is really hard because everyone has fully automatic grenade launchers with 10x thermal scopes making it impossible to spot people easily gosh 10/10",2
"i turned the settings to the absolute lowest settings and im still averaging 22 fps, definitely below playable framerate. i have a gtx 660 gpu and amd phenom 2 x4 965 cpu, so not the best parts but i should still be able to run the game on the lowest settings with smooth framerate. what is it with games these days coming out that are so poorly optimized?",1
"a dramatic improvement and revisualisation of the original arma minus alot of the fiddly controls. still holds true to the original, adds some strong improvements like extra firing positions and the long awaited control revamp. bohemia takes the best of arma2, sticks it in a microwave and turns it up to 11",1
"very good game ! a must for every gamer buy it now while it is on sale :)",1
"contols take ages to get used to and its very complicated to operate. wouldnt recommend getting it, waste of money and time getting use to the game. graphics are good though",1
"very good game. the new content is funny and i cant wait till the game is finisched. i bought it in the alpha status, now it is in the beta and the added content for the beta is nice. wait for the new stuff for more fun :d",1
"such a great game. once you get over the learning cure then its such a joy to play",1
"meh. unless your a really devote tactical millitary fps player this probably isnt for you",1
"such a great military simulator you cant turn your head around in a car to look around where are you supposed to go... a z-category shooter but you still have to use controls like if it would be starcraft. i dont play an fps to use my whole keyboard to issue broken commands. dont buy this game. for a strategy game theres only horribly-done strategy elements, and for an fps theres horribly done fps elements in it. for squads and commanders, buy battlefield or any other non-garbage tactical shooter, this game is just bad.",1
"awesome game amazing quallity !!!but!!! it takes up around 17 gb. and you need a really good computer for it!!",1
"this game is great. this game get alot of critisizm over the lack of content, and i dont think thats justified. the lack of vehicles and whatnot is just a redirection of effort into animations, phyics, customizable loadouts, attachments for weapons, improved ai, smoother controls, a much larger map, and of course, how pretty the game is. if people whine about the lack of weapons, you can just point out just how many weapon attachment combonations there are and so forth. bohemia is a great company that cares about its fan base, and they try to get as much content out there as they can. some people talk about how expensive the new dlc that just came out is, when i reality, you get most of the content from it for free, the $15 is more of a donation then anything else. whenever bohemia add a feature into the game that the fan cry out for, the fan immediately start to whine about somthing else, most recently, bipods and such. another thing that the fan whine over is poor optimization of the game. the game runs fine, and if it doesnt, you could always tone down the graphic options a tad, it wont hurt the gameplay. tl;dr its a good game and it really doesnt deserve the critisizm it gets.",4
"excellent game, realistic combat simulation, fun with friends. many times you will spend 20 minutes setting up the perfect mission conditions, gear setup, and vehicle convoy... then you friend comes in balls-deep with a helicopter ruining it. i am that friend.",1
"this is by far the most dumbest and worst game ive ever played, the misions are ing horrible, nothing happens in 30 mins and then only 3 guys pop up and then nothing happens for another 30 mins. if you are ready to start hating yourself then buy this game and regret it forever. its was a mistake buying this",1
"amazing graphics, fun game to play. glad to see all the mod support.",1
"a great game for anyone who likes simulators. there are many different mods and gamemodes for anyone. from rpg to zeus, this game has everything.",3
"a game in which almost always when you die it is the games fault. broken  piece of  in which you have to scroll through menus to do  which is very convenient when in the middle of a firefight, almost revolutionary id say. a simulator where the cars explode(!) when you crash it into anything. this is a game made by devs who have never played any modern games and take all their inspiration from their own past games and the only one that they made that was considered modern was the original operation flashpoint back in 1998 or something. all their games past that have imitated that game and arma 3 design is still based on that game (read: doesnt work very well anymore, or never really did) if it still isnt very obvious this is a rage post. ive played the game for over 100 hours for some reason and i continue to play it but im still convinced that 10 hours in bohemias office and i could fix the design of this game.",1
"multiplayer is really the best. you can have fun solo but the interaction with others in a fun and in a semi strict quasi-military group is where to be. lots of mods and new missions out there so there is no reason to get bored!! grab a rifle and march on..",3

"imagine dayz with good frames and cars. oh wait that is arma 3!",1
"brilliant game! if you have friends to plau with and a powerful pc pick this game up",4
"this game have the best realism where you can easily die by bullets, high recoil and no terms of one-man-army like most of the game these days. its possible to be oma but that requires many tries on each levels. the bad thing is that the gameplay is kind of boring because theres too many information that you recieved but less thing you can do. instructions/guide while in game sometimes doesnt help a new player to understand this game. too many button to use! the ai in singleplayer kindda dumb. the ai doesnt react to our command smart enough. realism : 9.0/10 gameplay : 5.5/10 ai : 3.5/10 graphics : 8.5/10 physics : 7.5/10 overall : 6.8/10",1
"this game floored me. then i fell throught the floor into hell and i was like dang thats one hell of a game.",1
"beautiful, complex, difficult and advanced. many things can be said about arma 3 but one thing is for sure. when you get a group of friends together for some missions, its very fun and entertaining. on the downside is the learning curve, which is long and the game lacks a tutorial wallktrough. atleast i havent found one. ive never played arma or arma 2 either, which problably makes my period of learning even longer.",1
"really fun game! recommend to buy it muliplayer has like mode called zues like doguen dragons.",1
"most realistic shooter in the world. the best game i have ever played by far. it is very different from arma 2, but the main concept is still there. it may take some time to get used to the controls and keys, but it is worth it.",1
"very fun i have had it for like 4 months and i never played it but once i did i was hooked",1
"i absolutely love this game. i can play in the sandbox multiplayer servers for hours!",2
"fantastic game. a really immersive game that you can pump a lot of hours into. plus an incredibly complex and expansive multiplayer.",1
"this game is rock solid awesome, but it lacks direction. the mp facet needs work to be inclusive to new members. however for an infantry sim it is simply amazing, especially when combine with mods.",1
"love all the mods, its incredible how many scenarios you can be involved in.",1
"has to be one of the best games i have ever played, it has me addicted to playing it, would definatley recommend this to friends and other players, would also recommend the altis life gamemode as it is good fun and what i personally send most of my time on.",2
"absolutely worth buying. i wouldnt trust the relatively low metascore since this game lives from the content the community provides. at the point the reviews were done, there only were very few user created missions and mods. this game is very complex and deep. you will either hate it or love it, but you should definitely give it a try for at least a few hours before you judge.",2
"great game, so much to do with the new zeus mode patience is key to success in this game the game is graphically awesome at night time lighting is great overall fun game",2
"get to tha chop.., a thousand meters away a sniper smiles froma cut short sentence.",3
"one of the best games i have played to date, altislife.co.uk with this game is perfect",5
"great game really enjoyable i reccomend it to any gamer",1
"in an over view, i do reccomend this game. i bought this the day it was released for alpha, and i knew the gameplay was going to be rough. since then, it has broadly improved, but i still see some lacking areas. i mainly notice this in the aviation area. (i like jets, pretty sure im the only one) without any mods, there is only one jet available, for cas, and aas (correct me if im wrong if its not called that) and one uav. i find this rather disapointing, as there is no lack of jets in arma2, and all of its addons. i just think some more jets should be added, that do not require the download of mods. (some people do not know how to apply them) but overall, i like this game, and reccomend it to anyone (arma veterans or not) who is looking for a good game to put time into.",1
"metascore for this game should be 95% at least. this is the best war simulator for the general public. no cod, no bf can compare. the game is what i hoped operation flashpoint (2000) would turn out someday. awesome game and unlimited possibilities.",1
"if you were a big fan of operation flashpoint back in the day and you think that the game has totally gotten derailed from where it was before - it actually is the same game with a lot of improvements and enhancements. i totally recommend this game to you if you enjoy tactical gameplay and military simulation. so far my favorite modification is the official arma iii zeus mod, which allows game masters to create their own missions on-the-fly, though they could add some more parameters for zeus servers (so the admin could disable game moderator totally - as sometimes youngsters join up and destroy everything). but so far so good. the game is very tactical and if youre into fast shooter games such as call of duty or battlefield - i really doubt this would be the ideal game for you unless you are willing to learn and see more. this game series goes in depth with the daily things they do in the military nowadays (or well, in the future, as this isnt exactly based on 2014 warfare). i love the game despite the fact that i havent played it too much; but as an old operation flashpoint veteran i would say that this is a great game.",1
"who has the mental capacity to buy this piece of ? me. im a ing",1
"i became actually generally proficent in combat knowledge and tactics with this game. thanks, bohemia; i can be soldier man now.",1
"i dont really like the vanilla game, also the old arma ii missions like domination 2 and insurgency are terrible. but when you play in an experienced group with a few hundred mods. its freaking awesome. vanilla i dont like the gameplay and their are only a few weapons. but with some mods this game has no limits. try to find a group or clan who makes their own missions and you will have an amazing time. if not, good luck with the single player.",1
"10/10 loving altis life,wasteland,battle royale this is a great game defos would buy an arma 4",2
"do you enjoy constant ctd? get this. its all it does. get a good desktop wallpaper, because youre going to be seeing it alot.",5
"this game is really good. (a must buy for open world gamers)!!!",1
"by far, the best single and multiplayer experiance ever.",4
"best game. cause theres no other words to describe this.",4
"was flying a full ghosthawk the other day taking some guys to an ao. i wanted to stay safe so i checked the map and marked an lz that would block visuals of me via the trees that were in the area. i head out and keep myself low when we get close. im about 10 feet off the ground when tank rounds start hitting the side of my chopper. im hearing beeps and  in my head and my anti-torque rotor was out so it threw us into a spin. i switched to thirdperson to see if i was going to hit a tree or not and all i saw was dead guys pouring out of the other side. im finally on the ground and im knocked unconscious. as my screen flashes in and out, i see machine gunners throwing hundreds of rounds in all directions while three guys revive the ones that didnt die on the ground. as the guy that dragged me out brought me back all he said was inb4 dangerzone you wont get that rush from any other game. i would definitely reccomend, holy  does it get intense.",2
"if your computer can handle it then its a fun game! would recoment altis life.",1
"this game is mad. best army simulator thing ive tried",1
"easily worth the price a military simulator with so many options. if you havent played arma before you will find the controls daunting but once you get used to them the game is great. the other issues can be de sync(lag) and low frame rate on some maps. this can make the game frustrating but the good times in this game out weigh the bad unlike some of the big aaa titles over the last few years. the thing about arma games is the longer they are out the better they get because of the community created mods. arma2 is still a great game which i still play and has a huge following. some of my favourite arma3 mods are wasteland, king of the hill, altis life and many more. you arnt really buying a game you are buying countless options and countless gaming sessions. buy it, this game is on sale often so keep an eye out.",3
"great sandbox shooter with vehicles and mod support. you can swim and dive. you can play it as a shooter or a tactical game. and you can play a lightning shooting god with mind control. whats not to like?",1
"guns. terrible ai. guns. look, a tank. mortars inbound, sir! this game has everything youd want in a strategic, ultra-realistic fps. pros: -lots of gear, guns, and items for a complete and unique look for everyone -maps are huge, with lots of detail in every inch of them, which can be seen instantly upon entering the game -lots of vehicles, aircraft, and boatcraft -controls are easy to understand and deliver complete control over your character unlike any fps ive ever played cons: -ai can be completely  sometimes -driving vehicles and running over very small rocks - and i mean very small rocks - will utterly destroy you and your vehicle -sometimes there are too many options, control wise, and you end up messing up on what you wanted to do, resulting in death -even on a very nice pc: i7 4770k, 16gb ram, ssd, gtx 780, online games reuslt in insane lag in large scale fights overall id suggest this game to anyone who wants to get into a more realistic military simulation. score: graphics 8.5/10 gameplay 8.5/10 overall 8.5/10",1
"very good game..but a little bit too heavy for a gaming pc..i have i5 4430 8gb ram & gtx770 and i cant handle it with 60fps while i am streaming..please just make a new patch for cpu cores because mine hits on 80& usage..:( i am playing on high setting without anti-allaiting on 54 fps on average..soo bad for gaming rig with 2 ssds and some good parts!",1
"im going to make my review as short as possible. arm is a monster of a game, and a damn good one to. if you are not willing to put time into the controls and gameplay you will be bored and frustrated quickly. from what i have found, the community is very mature, the servers are good and the gameplay is suspenseful. we have not seen any game like this in a long time, there is an insane amount of content, the graphics are amazing, and the feeling is absolutely pinpoint what it is meant to be. i coudnt recomend this more to the people who are interested in the idea 9/10",1
"probably one of the most complex games i have ever played but i always want to keep playing it.",1
"this game offers a lot. and i mean a lot. you can download endless missions made from the community workshop and play with strategy with your friends or run around half naked and dance around. or you could roleplay and buy an atm from all the drug money you earned in altis life. or have races with friends in karts. this game is an army simulator, but its great for modding which lets you do more things. now, this game isnt something like cod or battlefield, it takes strategy and tactics and patience. if you come from these games it will be harder to get into fast. although if you play through the campaign it will help you get used to the game. please dont think the warfare in this game is just pew pew pew, die, respawn, repeat. it takes skill. altis is a very big map, you can drive around for what seems like forever in this beautiful map. there is forestry, a lot of ocean, desert, grassland, etc. there is also stratis, a smaller, more wastelandish and deserty than altis. you need a good pc to run this game. i usually get around 45 fps on online servers, around 60 on single player or games with small amounts of people in it. overall, this game has a ton of things to do and you cant get bored of it. i give it a 9.5/10",4
"kind of glitchy but a load of fun and an insane amount of depth. if you are a fan of games with a good amount of tacticality, this is a must buy even at its pricepoint.",1
"great game, even better that daniel doesnt have it!",1
"i can see how much fun this game can be, but when im 1m from the objective and cant get closer to interact with it, and cant continue the mission until i interact with it... and its only getting in the vehicle, well sorry im not gonna spend 30$ in todays market on such a game - i dont care how good people say it is. i like the graphics, didnt mind the long install time, love the mechanics - crawl, compass, etc. i guess im pickier than most however, and wary of spending money on a game that starts out rather slow and buggy. i know we all wonder why someone cant get it right whith so many trying. this game feels closer than most others to achieving that rightness.",1
"i love this game! so many different ways to play this game whether its a modded rpg or a survival apocalypse this game, in my opinion, is the best game to get if you want to download mods for it.",2
"optimization is really bad, but gameplay is great!",1
"this game has great potential, but is killed by engine issues in multiplayer.",1
"much fun. such enjoyment. wow. good sandbox game. love the altis life mod/gamemode.",5
"i find this to be one of the better open world games that i have played in a long time but the driving in this game is a little tricking but i do recomend it to others as it is a really fun gamr to get and if you get the ccg launchers it makes it even more fun as this then brings in the construction of building and also the few zombies that i have come accross make the game a little more challanging but all in all awsome game have fun boys and girls",1
"the game its self is pretty , its altis life that makes this game.",1
"i love this game, mods make it way more fun but with out mods its still a very good game",1
"i was playing it to see what it is like only to know how it feels to have a crappy computer. i shouldnt be getting fps problems. i was trying to figure out the problem. i was tweaking the settings, nothing. went online figured out they only use 1 core of your processor. i was really looking foward to playing this game but it seems the development team dont know what they are doing when it comes to computers.",1
"better than ing battlefield 4 , buy it, get used to the controls, and you will be the happiest most lifless person next to me on earth.",2
"i got it for 20 buckerunos when it came out so heil i guess",1
"the editor is powerful and impressive. i made a scenario where we played as blackwater and wasted a bunch of civillians while speeding through the streets. 10/10 would commit war crimes again",1
"this game is awesome!! the multiplayer is great! with hundreds of servers to entertain all types of gamers",2
"this game is fun to play with friends on a server or download the communitys games and try them out. loads of different modes online you can play. but i recommend playing with friends its way more fun to screw around that way",1
"great game. many mods, worth. but the low fps kinda sucks.",1
"the nato forces had us pushed back to our final two bases, i was stationed at the northern camp. our forces were beaten back hard, and we were scattered. i battled fatigue up the hill to get a vantage point looking down across the east from the beach to the mainland, i adopted the prone position and set up my lmg and scoped the area. thats when i saw it, a brown figure darting accross the fields below, performing evasive maneuvers the likes i had never seen. it was an intense 5 minutes, leading the target and squeezing the trigger to deliver a burst of rounds at my foe. finally my enemy took refuge (or so he thought) on a ridge nestled between two trees. i aimed precisely, meaning for this to end and took my final shots. i observed for several minutes when i decided to go and get a certain status on my enemy. as i walked up to the ridge i could not see my enemy in sight, so i looked around some more. it must have been 30 seconds until i looked down and saw his little b***** whiskers and his **** floppy a*** ears and noticed my god damned foe was a mother f******* bunny rabbit. 10.01/10 will definitely buy",1
"its a must buy. love the graphics. love all the mods. i enjoy modding in this game, best game i like thats mod friendly. you must buy this game, you are missing out on all those cool multiplayer gamemodes like arma 3 life, wasteland, altis life, king of the hill, breaking point and epoch mod. buy now!",2
"a very nice game alot of mods the altis life mode is the best. i give it 9/10 .",1
"arma 3 is a wonderful platform for military simulation. where the game truly shines is with the extensive modding community. you will do yourself a disservice if you do not check out any of the multitudes of mods for this title. the game itself with out the mods is a great improvement over prvious titles like arma 2 for example. personally i used to be big on the battlefield series but once i started playing arma it was arma or nothing for my modern day first person shooter. the depth and scope that you can get into here with the combined arms focus is truly amazing. everything fromt he graphics, to physics to sound effects are really good. oh and if you dont want to use the vanilla stuff, again theres mods, even full conversions that bring all the assests from previous games into this one. theres also a really fun multiplayer mode called zues, which is essentially dungeons and dragons meets first person modern day shooter. one player acts like the dm and the others play in his / her world. allowing you to create dynamic ever changing and unique situations on the fly. this one gets my whole hearted thumbs up. for information on how to mod your game, check out this youtube video:",5
"simply put, if your not a fan of arma - your definitely not a cool kid!",2
"arma to others but it is not a game for everyone and even inside the game there will be aspects of the game you like such as [military reinactments] and dislike such as [ battleroyal call of duty deathmatch] so everyone will want to play the game differently, but remember its game where no one has to tell you how to play it. overall 7/10 the game has problems in its polish but when you look past it you get a gaming experience like no other. note: this review has alot of spelling mistakes and missing subjects as i came up with this in 30 mins, future reviews will be written on proper writting software and also days in advance. i hope this review has helped you! note2: 743 characters too long!!!??? sorry i couldnt provide enough info but steam has a character limit so in the immortal words of awsome people i say test review, please ignore.",5
"great game, and so much stuff you can do with all the types of mods you can play a must get.",1
"better combat than arma 2. now are the guns better? yeh, attachments make them better. do they handle better? well, id argue that the damage system and how bullets flyed was better in arma 2, and that people move too fast when jogging in arma 3. but then again, people still play battle royal and koth in arma 3 so yeah, arma 3 is better.",1
"my friend got downed and i carried him only to get shot in left nut 10/10",1
"best played in first person for sure. the most realistic warfare game hands down. battfield and call of duty are awesome but just not nearly as realistic and the graphics on arma 3 are some of the best i have seen. amazing terrain detail that looks very real. the sounds are also some of the most realistic in a game ever. game is worth every penny.",2
"looking pretty amazing; absolutely can not wait for the final product. this game is going to be intense.",5
"known to kick it like the captain of a soccer team",1
"a2 but with all bugs fixed, well most, but im very upset that i bought it at the beginning of the week and wasnt thinking of steam summer sale, and now its $20 less. grrrr. but yeah this arma is way more realistic, way improved, weapon customization, smoother gameplay, and if you are really looking for some tactical realism, this game is home to the most serious gaming clans. but hey its $40!! buy it!",1
"if you like tactical military simulation genre, buy this, try to explore arma world like altis life, wasteland, and many more cant stop play without it 11/10",3
"the closest thing to real life firefights that ive seen to this day.",1
"thought you could be a soldier? think again! arma 3 throws the player into a near realistic shooter designed to test the best of gamers. a honourable challenge to any and all.",1
"they sold dlc to make the tripods work that came out on release day... i need to pay extra to fix broken a game? i made a huge mistake buying dayz and arma, i will not support bohemia interactive anymore.",1
"tends to run like , get shot by a pleb..... 10/10 would buy again",1
"very realistic, unlimited ways to play. i just spent 3 hrs driving a tank around the island just looking at the scenery. i havent even fired a shot yet and im hooked...lol!",1
"if you are looking for a game that will keep you going for a long time - you will need to play arma! there is sp campaign thats awesome and really recommended before you dive into mp combat. mp is a completetly different story - a whole lot of community build content is out there to enjoy! (steam workshop is a good starting point)",4
"its a damn amazing game so much fun, when your roleplaying, fighting or just playing zeus with your buddies i do feel they tried to soak up money with the helicopter dlc but personally i dont mind they do need money for a new engine which im sure they will try to make. when your roleplaying speeding from the popos in yer trusty hatchback yeling cya m8 then when you come back around you wheels get popped and your car just stops you just go like .... oh my god d: run it has a very very big and challenging campaign depending on the difficulty your playing at personally im finding the campaign to be alot of fun! and the battles on altis life rpg the battles just ok ok ok this game has so much content cons - old bohemia engine - helicopter dlc was said to be free but then when it came out ._. - yeaa i cant think of much else 10/10 100/100 1000/1000 213819273123712738973/10",3
"very good game really enjoy playing this game i recommend it if you are thinking of buying this product",3
"this is a really good game, provides many hours of goodness. favorite thing to do is wasteland with freinds.",2
"this game is pretty good but on every server ive been they have fps issues and alot of laggs. also the combat kind of sucks, like if you are hurt you cant aim anymore.. like wtf ?",1
"dont trust the official system requierments, they are .",1
"great game, very poorly optimised though i am not getting good frames and there are no dayz servers in australia!!!",1
"the core game ill give it 5/10 soley for its engine. the campaign is rubbish, its cod on steroids. id even say arma2 campaign was better then this, atleast the first few missions were before it went to warfare but i digress. arma 3 with rhs and a good multiplayer clan (coop) will blow your mind. may i suggest blastcore and tfradio to complete your wargame experiance. bis take note.",3
"you like arma 2 ? the life or realistic mod server ? guess what you will love arma 3 then.. even it is an alpha it has most of our beloved mods in it and it works like a charm ! beta is just a week away ! :)",1
"there aint any horses in this motha a.  you and this game",1
"this game is great. do anything you want on two massive maps and litterally anything from flying jets and killing enemies from 1000m away with a cheytac you can do it",1
"too advanced, and teamates will ditch you constantly. also many framerate issues.",1
"arma:3 is a great experience with high quality graphics and realism. it even manages to run more efficiently then its predecesor, arma:2.",1
"1st time playing this i go on altis life with a friend, heres how it went: we spawned, bought a bag and a hat each, went picking apples for a few hours then bought a car each and went to do some delivery missions my friend crashed and i drove 18.5km to repair his car, only to find he was dead 2 paramedics came and revived him, i took the hat from my dead friends body first and offered it as payment the girl took the hat because the guy didnt like it and then accused me of being sexist because he wanted my hat he chased me around his ambulance for 10 minutes shouting give me the f***ing hat i dropped the hat, drove off only to see the ambulance over take me and get blown up by terrorists i then burned in the wreck trying to get my hat back 11/10",1
"overall this game is very realistic,fun and tactical ideal to play with friends; this game is solely for people who love military simulation and realsim please if you are one of these people i only have one thing to say. get this game! :d",1
"at first i was like pew pew pew pew but now im like ... waiting... pew.",2
"got some friends. made a badass group named the orphanage. once teamed up with the sock rebellion. meet people and make them orphans. robbed the federal reserve. took over a town. this all happened in the afternoon. #noragrets",1
"dont buy this game. its not finished. there is no story, there are bugs, ai is stupid,........ bohemia doesnt give a  about releases they promised. we are still waiting for the 2nd part of the campaign that should have been released - as promised - in december. now the tell us it will be february. its a sanbox and without community developers this game would worth 0.- i highly recomment to wait a few months.",4
"this gotta be one of the best games i have ever seen",1
"its a lot like minecraft with all the mods and stuff... except without the blocks, and swords, and with more guns and explosions. but really though good game with free content",1
"real life war-simulator and extremely detailed. 10 psi out of 10",1
"personally love the arma series, 3 started off good but has since got unplayable for me after each update. gone from 60fps to sometimes under 30 regardless of server or game type. nothing has changed at my end, so given up for now. edit: ok, on my new pc this gaming is truely awesome. just one of those games that needs a nearly insane amount of hardware to run best",1
"youre going to need a good pc to run this with a reasonable amount of frames, and youre going to need to abandon your call of duty mentality to truly enjoy this --and youre also going to want to get serious about the mod community- but if youre a fan of military style games and want a massive environment with no invisible walls, then this is the game for you.",2
"least user-friendly game i have ever played (or attempted to play). if you are an online gamer, good luck figuring out how to join a server. after spending over an hour trying and failing to play multiplayer, then searching google for a tutorial, its very obvious why this game will never succeed: its impossible to join any multiplayer server. stick with games made by professional developers and avoid this wanna-be bs crap",1
"besst game ever!!! i love bi provides the community with all the means to create custom content!",3
"very versatile. mods and a great campaign make this one of the best pc actions games out now.",1
"fun and realistic combat simulator. strong lurning curve but when you start to learn it, you can have alot of fun. i strongly recommend to people who like realistic games.",1
"great game, atlis life, island life, dayz, and epoch mod. cant wait !!!!!!!",1
"im not a massive fps gamer, but then, i dont really count this game as a fps. its not like battlefied, cod or any of those types of titles. this is a combat simulator, and i have been immidiately impressed with the single player campaign (which i normally dont play!). the game doesnt feel as responsive as some newer titles (bf4), but its realism to me, seems excellent. i dont know of course, ive never been in a war, and hope i never have too - but playing this game makes me feel about as close as id want to get. i only started playing this game really after playing dayz standalone, and will definately be continuing the explore it further.",1
"if you have to read a review of arma 3 to decide whether or not to jump in, buy the game.... seriously.. youve played shooters before im sure, and youve thought to yourself i wish you could do _______ enter arma 3, where doing _________ is what you do.. whatever you can imagine, you can do... if it doesnt come out of the box, someone has probably made it. mods, team play, and strategy is what its all about.. youre not usually playing against other players... instead you play with other players, against some of the most realistic ai i have ever seen.. all arma games to date have been amazing, but arma 3 takes a leap, simplifying the controls, while providing more and exciting options for the seasoned player.. it is truly the culmination of all weve wanted in a decade of arma... buy it.. youll love it.. there are too many features to list here, but lets just say, youll get in, and youll never get out...",1

"i try this game but they try to came with others playing than the others games ... and its confusing and hard to play at the beginning. at the first training, i fired on a box with item and i failed my mission with a friendly fire on a box ... big bugs ...",1

"an awsome fps?third person shooter with multiple gamemodes from everyday life to full out war",1
"i downlaoded this for free on thursday but i cant acsess it ; (",1
"the problem is, is that bis have gone full psycho. they say they want their game to be a big sandbox that everyone can mod on, and that was true of arma 2. but now, in arma 3, there are very few vehicles, and theyre all sci-fi. theres a ton of bugs, the game is only half finished, and they tricked everyone into paying $60 for it, saying it would be finished upon release. which was a total lie. now, if you complain about that on their forums, your banned without any explanation. they even ban your ip so you cant make another account. its also a steam game, so the producers lurk on the steam forums, and if they see you complain on there to steam, they ban you there as well, since they have mod status. and now, even if you say oh well, its half baked, and start making suggestions for improvement, they ban you for that as well. so basically, you cant say anything on their forums now. unless its to kiss their  and tell them how wonderful they are. the arma forums are a ghost town to everyone but fanboys. everyone else has been banned. its a shame, because it was a good game / sim. but the greedy as.s.holes at bis have turned into worse than ea, and all they care about now are lies and money.",1
"absolutely great buy. i wasnt into arma 2 that much as i bought it just for dayz, but this game was something else. i got into arma 3 very easilly even with some of the complex controls. i love the campaign as it is even though it is still going. the player comunity is great to interact with and the game delivers. good buy.",1
"bad optimisation in the engine leads to fps lag, meaning you need a pretty insane rig to run it, even tho you shouldnt have to. has a lot less content than previous arma versions (not counting community ofc). i enjoy the game, but the fps issues (which cant be fixed because they have to re-design the engine) and the lack of conent makes it stale quite quickly. edit: due to some incredible community members, some missions are now actually playable. wasteland by sa-matra is very stable, as are some altis life servers. system: i5 2500k @ 4,2ghz 16gb ram @ 1600mhz gtx 660ti ocd with this, i get around 20-60fps wether its on low or ultra, it still runs the same.",2

"they should lower the price but everything else is fine like the gameplay and the animations.",1
"killed a cop, stole his car, got chased by 3 cars, died. 10/10 would do again",1
"a great itteration to the arma series, the new game engine makes the game run alot smoother than the arma 2 engine and keeps the graphical fidelity higher than before. a very fun experience and a must have for milsim or arma lovers alike.",1
"unique game. this doesnt count as a shooter, its a military simulator, but with good reason. the term shooter is used loosely to designate any game with guns. in this game, understanding military language, logistics, and tactics is just as important as having enough ammo and good aim. i rate this game highly, but dont walk into this expecting guns ablazing and being an insane tank able to take down platoons of dudes. its for its own crowd, its up to you to figure out if you are/want to be part of that crowd.",3
"arma has gone a long way. the game is great, but it could still use some more realism. still too many glitches and the game still doesnt have that feel to it. i do love the game, but still could use some improvements from it. cant wait to see some more realalistic action packed the game has to offer. maybe arma 4 if it happens will bring even more of that and get rid of the robot voices and the big majority of the glitching ai and glitches in general. more planes offered by many countries. the f/a-18, f/a-22, f/a-35, eurofighter, you name it. bring in more planes. the game has the vehicles and the tanks but not the planes.",2
"besides the lights shining through mountains, this game is epic. by far one of the best sandbox simulators i have ever come accross. so much smoother than arma 2, arma 3 has the ability to make you forget you are in a game.",1
"arma 3 is probably one of the best games ever in my opinion. the rpg is unbeatable and people who play this game like to actully play it legit.",1
"bought some lsd in altis life, ran from the cops when they noticed purple smoke coming from my truck. and hired a getaway helicopter only to find out i didnt have the helicopter dlc. i got arrested and went to jail for 1:10:00 minutes. the guy in the helicopter tried to break me out of jail. i only then realized that u cant get in copilot if u dont have dlc. i am not a wanted fugitive and have 3 bounties of 10million on me. 100/10",1
"a really good military simulator. takes a while to get used to the controls and learning how the game works, but its worth it.",1
"this game is one of my favourites. the engine of arma 3 is a bit glitchy but it still rocks and i have a lot of fun with it. there are so many mods and gamemodes out there that i could play this game all day long. the best part of the game is the multiplayer in my opinion. you can have a ton of fun with friends in this game. if no one of your friends is playing this game there are still enough other players out there in the world you can meet ingame and play with them. my favourite gamemode is wasteland and",1
"arma 3 is mechanically and graphically better than arma 2. the problem lies in the fact that there is far less content and extreme preformance problems on amd systems. i simply cannot recommend this game due to the many problems in preformance.",1
"a game where you can select who you want to play with. cos you know. a ing real game with ing community and caring devs and a real game where there is both fun and skill... you select who you want to play with. you select who you want to play aganist. you can try different people and places if they are idiots you can ing leave and no one punishes you with more idiotism... a reference game.  game community like 7 year old russian army(dota) and dev like jews who think nothing but money(dota) should watch and learn.",3
"very entertaining but has some problems such as some of the worst optimization and lack of content that they try to sell to us in dlc but is overall a good game",2
"endless hours of fun. so much funny and awesome  happens. however, it is pretty commanding on your pc. but thats easily fixed. it only gets better the more friends you have playing with you. i would like more of mine to have it (ing buy it casey). anyway, great game! so many amazing memories and it hasnt even been that long. highly recommend it.",3
"arma 3 is easy to explain. imagine arma 2. now add proper stances to it, alot better performance, alot of fixed bugs (alot more introduced aswell) and on and on. arma 3 is a good game for what it is. the main problem is: the devs are ing lazy, they didnt bother modelling lots of civillian cars like in arma 2, instead, 4 or 5 that just have different skins. about 1 tank per faction. 3 or 4 helicopters and  me, only one ing jet. i mean thats ing lazy. the amount of content in arma 3 is ing embarrasing compared to the shear amount of content in arma 2. bohemia interactive have done a great job with all the new content etc. but this game should still either be in alpha, or very early beta. not a finished game. overall if your reading this to see weather you wanna get this game or not, its down to you. if you want a game that runs and plays really well, if you can look past the laziness of the devs and the lack of assets, then get it. if you cant however, just stick with arma 2 until the devs actually do something about the lack of assets etc. again, this game should be in late alpha - early beta. not a finished game.",1
"probably the best game for serious players who can work together to accomplish the mission.",1
"this game is super fun, and the mods make it even more fun!",1
"work on that multy player fps drop bohemia for the love of god!!!!!!",1
"well th game its self is amazing omfg i love it better then dayz i really love it buy im really pissed that after a week of owning it.it will not load anymore it just says preparing to launch aram 3 and it sits there for hours and does nothin make sure you have a poweful pc or a gaming pc because a crappy family or business pc wil not do it but other then that its really good",1
"felt clunky. might get it when its cheaper though.",1
"the best action game made yet (in my opinion). with mods its really cool to create your own missions/scenarios becasue you can build pretty much everything you want to, the only bad side is that the editor map can be difficult in the beginning but when you have learned how it works the game will be fantastic",3
"one of the best games ive ever played. almost every update they releae makes the game almost like real life also the rpg servers are epic",4
"yo bro this game is kool dude i was stunned when colonel dickbutt came over the radio and he was like yo  get to the objective i was like wow this game is so realistic and cool but then i remembered its on the arma engine so i quit",1
"1-10 because i purchased it. i bought it in alpha hoping that a full game would be released but it still has not. campaign is a joke, because there are player made campaigns that are 10x harder and more complex. multiplayer server hosting does not work 7 times out of 10. there is virtually no effort by bohemia to release content, it would be very easy for them to release all arma 2 content for arma 3, the community has done it but its damn straight  to get it to work and it barly does even when you get it too. there are virtually no weapons in the game. all the good features for arma 3 are made by the players. they have released less content than one dlc of anygame. just goes to show europoors dont make good games. 1-10 would not buy if on sale for 5$. asked bohemia for my money back and they do not respond and you are not allowed to post on their forums.  tier company is  tier. this is a huge disapointment from arma 2 content wise. anyone who gives a good review didnt play arma 2. or has the expectations of a cawadooty game.",3
"best game i`ve played ever.soooooo many missions & addons. highly recommend for keyboard commando like me!!!!",2
"get this game even if only for the mods battle royale and overpoch. those two mods alone make this game a worthy purchase.",1
"great game, love the cover system, love the editor and zeus. only problem: crappy servers (cant find ones with people in my area). would recommend, as i do already.",1
"this military simulator is more than anything someone could ask for in a game it provides a good variety of mods, online game modes, scenarios. it also contains a flaw sometimes in the physics of the game but overall its worth buying if your looking for more than 4 hours of gameplay like most other games!",2
"its alright but costs as much as a patrick swayze shrine 7/10 no patrick swayzinator",1
"this game is a great military simulation game, but you will need a stronge computer to play it at its best. my personal game of the year. 10/10. good job bohemia interactive.",1
"its hard, its real war, its fun. you going to die loads and the learning curve is high. there are so many othions online with altis life and battle royale being my favorite. if you dont know anything about this title look out for lirik on twitch.",1
"arma 3 roleplay *hey cop where can i get mary* 10 out 10 and in all serious very good no very great!",3
"its fun but if your thinking of getting this instead of dayz standalone, definetely get dayz",1
"watching friends fly helicopters for the first time. 10/10.",2
"one of the best first-person shooter games ive played in my life! its also fun, and realistic, so is it worth the money, oh, hell yea!",1
"100/10 a game were anything is possiable. mods were you can see the fish you want to catch , run drugs and sell tortise meat. this game is the only fps were maps overlooking the world are usefull and radios are a nessecity , a great fps if you just want to have array of activities that dont invole you killing or shooting others like mining or picking peaches.",2
"bought some lsd in altis life, ran from the cops when they noticed purple smoke coming from my truck. and hired a getaway helicopter only to find out i didnt have the helicopter dlc. i got arrested and went to jail for 1:10:00 minutes. the guy in the helicopter tried to break me out of jail. i only then realized that u cant get in copilot if u dont have dlc. i am not a wanted fugitive and have 3 bounties of 10million on me. 100/10",1
"this game is most buggy piece of  dialup trash, arma 2 has less glitches than this piece of , do not ing buy biggest waste of money and time",2
"worst ing game ive ever played.... the least optimised game ive ever played, unplayable with 1-35fps all the time wiht a gtx780.... dont buy unless you want to spend 50 euros on 100% pure garbage",1
"10/10 would sell csgo skins for this game side note : npcs have aimbot on lowest difficulty (on singleplayer) , but the end result is worth it",1
"if you like gmod/shooter games you will find arma3 very fun with many many different missions/vehicals/guns it is much more fun with friends",1
"if you can get past the bugs and community, this title will surely leave you satisfied without costing an... arm and a leg. ...when do i get paid?",1
"it crashed alot but im running a pretty  rig, but its good especially coming from a long time arma fan :d",1
"play on a life server and get yelled at by a 10 year old admin",2
"a futureistic shooter with i high learning curve and a very active community.",1
"an awesome game to enjoy with friends. makes you feel like youre in the actual battle.",1
"awesome game , big improvment from arma 2, much better graphics, runs better even on my dated machine,better guns , better maps ,feels smoother ,great mods for it. altis life: lots of played interaction (not allways dm). do all manner of stuff to get money.be a drug runner, a bandit holding people up, delivery missions, farm materials, rob banks and federal reserve,be a car theif . spend on guns, cars, choppers, various licenses,become a rebal with access to naughty illigal fire power and cars, most fun iv had playing this mod has been trolling police , getting into car chases , shooting them in the face and taking their stuff or just generaly pissing them off, not played as a cop yet apart from steeling their cars and pretending to be one .. wasteland: its like battlefield on a massive scale and more in depth. farm for your guns ,cars and supplies, team up or not , make bases. can be really fast paced like battlefield or on larger maps you may need to go find the action. but it now , i heard they gunna run out of copies soon ><",2
"got together with some friends, decided that our lives were limited to picking cocaine. nothing else in life was working. girlfriends dumped us, failed out of school, in debt to the government. now i am living the life, got ourselves some vehicles, a warehouse, started a gang and are now ruling the streets with a force. enough so that now instead of just blasing  da police, we are literally ing them. 11/10",1
"great fps/simulator, not for cod style fans. -pros very immersive gfx with the mods/game types it always keeps the game fresh bullet physics are accurate excluding windage -cons sometimes (depending on the server/mod) you can have a very buggy gui overall this game is awesome if you like a more strategical fps (though it allows you to use 3rd person). due to the multitude of servers that run different game types you will find it hard to put this game down. if you like to rp then there is altis life which allows you to take up an persona and do task associated with a job that you choose. these types of servers are policed by a selected police force. if you are after some team work you can either choose a co-op mission which allows players to take on objectives enforced by a very intelligent ai. this being said there are servers that offer a pvp experience whether you want an objective base like king of the hill or deathmatch style. this game has what most gamers that enjoy fpss and even those who may not!",2
"really good! hard to see enemies at 100m. dlc is a buzz kill for costing so much atfer spending 63 bucks on the game itself. not having the dlc does not take away from the experience at all, unless you plan on playing online in a modded servers that requires you to have the dlc and other mods installed. i put yes for recommend but having not yet finished the game my review is still a bit mixed.",1
"all around excellent game. the campaign was very well put together, the graphics are amazing, the combat very realistic, and the squad movements are very realistic. it does take some time to get used to all the various controls, there are a lot of them, but once you figure it out you can move your squad through any level with ease and destroy everyone along the way. the mod content is getting better everyday! if you like quick pvp then wasteland and the battle royale mods are great for that. currently they have a dayz version of arma3 called breaking point that is an independent spin-off that is also quite fun. i personally cannot wait for the arma3 epoch (dayz) to come out because i have played the arma2 mods for a while now. there is also altis life and lakeside if youre into the rp scene but that is all preference. overall, its a well put together simulator that ex-military, which i am, or civilian with no experience can learn to enjoy and appreciate. --mb",1
"better than arma 2. not so ing buggy. but still, a very nice game. i have 200 hours on this piece of . its very fun to slide on my  and shoot. i think call of duty advanced warfare should have the should  slide feature in it. overall i give this game 9.999999/10.5 .",2
"realistic. and sometimes not realistic, but its a simulator so whatd you expect. go kill a bunch of people and make a ton of money racking up your war crimes only to realize hours later none of it was real. kinda like playing a game all day huh?",3
"i am new to this game (never played any arma games before) and i have to say it is awesome! i havent really got into playing multiplayer yet as i am still learning the controls etc. but the editor is insane. i have just been creating small missions for myself to learn the ai and how to drive, fly, run, swim, shoot and all that is involved. i love flying the helicopters. the cockpits are so realistic and with my headphones on the sound is good too. some of the sound could be better but there are so many cool sound effects in this game. im coming from bf3 and bf4 and this is a whole different experience. rain, lightning, day, night, the lighting effects are so cool and i am just getting started with it. i have an nvidia quadro k3000m and can run at 60fps with quality settings. this is my editing cpu and i seriously might build a new machine for this game. if you want to run around and shoot people, level up, unlock weapons etc. this is not for you. i could honestly see this used as a training tool for military operators. it is the real deal.",3
"if you like playing games youll like playing this game.",1
"i have this game on my other account and its amazing :d",1
"as you would expect,an amazing combat sim with lots of military toys to play with.",1
"arma 3 brings so much different game types to the table. from altis life which is a crazy gta online style clone that is better, to full on war simulator with ari, land, troops. there is so much to do in this game. if you cant find something to do in this game then you need to get to a doctor quick... cause you might be dead. :) enjoy.",1
"great game, kinda buggy but its a great step up from arma ii",2
"its arma. if youre even thinking about getting it, get it. it is that good. sure there are a few bugs but overall, they hit this one out of the freakin park.",1
"i like shooter games, and i always saw my brother playing them and they looked very fun. when i was old enough, i got call of duty and had a blast. i kind of expected that kind of fun from this game, but i was dissapointed. even on beginner difficulty the soldiers take 30 minutes to kill, and you take 2 shots to the foot and you are dead whereas you can shoot them in the chest five times and they ill crouch and order their whole squad to fire on you with their unrealistically impeckable accuracy. if you like pulling out your hair and the feeling of overwhelming rage, this is the game for you. if not, you are wasting your money.",1
"i officially declare this game to have one of the 3 worst single player campaigns i have ever experienced in my long gaming career. whyyyy?! why did these guys waste so much time on something that that they are not good at, instead of fixing the existing bugs and adding custom content? arma iii is unique, like a special needs kid whos messed up in the head but can also hack through the most advanced security system. it has a lot of potential but you have to have a monster pc and swim through a lake of cr*p to get to the good parts. disappointed i am very much so far, but i cant not recommend this game, even in its broken state. i am however probably going to revert to arma ii.",2
"too many wasteland servers. more domination and warfare please.",1
"im dead a this game like simulaton you shold buy this game wwwwwwwwwwwwwwooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwww im dead",1
"its an alright game not as good as the past installments but it does bring some new stuff to the table; improved graphics , more stances and better running animations. dont think that they should have set it further into the future just wrecks the immersive factor. also contains loads of bugs and frame rate issues. i would recommend buying arma 2 and arma 2 oa first before buying this becuase the modding community has not backed this game enough and as far as i know they have not added ace/acre mod and a propper vietnam usung mod yet.",1
"never knew i couldnt fly through an electric wire with an helicopter until now blew up told my friends a hacker killed me 10/10 would lie again",1
"its a pretty hard game at least if you havent played these before but when you get there its awesome! you will get the most of it when you play with a group of friends. since there is so many mods there will be something to play for everyone no matter what you like. definetly would recommend this to someone who likes realistic wargames.",1
"amazing game. so much to do and hours of fun. it is worth paying full price 10/10",1
"the definitive military sim. it does not get any better that this. great graphics, astounding design and a large sense of scale allows for countless hours of enetertainment. the high customization does not hurt it either.",1
"i have had arma 3 for only 24 hours and i absolutely love it, altis life is my favorite mode so far. this game has so much diversity when it comes to mods and communities, i am glad i made this investment, it was well worth the money being that i got it for $30, it may or may not be worth the full $60 yet, but once i play a bit more i might find out if it is or not! but i highly recommend this game to anyone who loves mods and role playing or for anyone looking to joing gaming communities. rate: 9.5/10",1
"all around, a great mil-sim! however, i recommend having a supercomputer from the future if youre a graphics junkie.",1
"i play this game more for the mods than anything else, really. mod-wise its cool. breaking point!!!",1
"played battle royale, plane went straight in the ground 11/10",1
"love it. bohemia has really outdone themselves. the campaign grows constantley with each update. multiplayer is fun, with official servers and game modes, or mods to play, or even just some simple scenarios with friends. love the multiplayer, and is super easy to learn through the virtual reality simulator, and the virtual arsenal allows you to see how well you fight with what gun. loved it",1
"arma has been around for along time and i think that anyone into realsiat games thi ones for you",1
"pro tip for anyone new to arma. get it and get good.",1
"great game! i love realistic fps games like these, and cant recommend it enough! teamwork and tactics are a necessity.",1
"really good game. really recommend playing role-playing mods, they are so much fun.",3
"takes a beastly computer to run. -professor cow, phd",1
"i completely stand behind this game. this is a military simulator so right off the bat you know that this is not the typical call of duty, or newest battlefield game. it takes strategy and teamwork to complete the missions when playing co-op. when speaking of multiplayer, you have so many options. i have not even gotten to the story yet because i have played so much multiplayer. you can choose to play some of the core missions that are included with the game, but you can also play mods that other people create, this is where i feel that the game excells. i have played many of the most popular mods to date on this game such as arma life, altis life, breaking point, epoch, and many more. i can confidently say that even if you do not like the core missions of the game you can sink countless hours into most of the multiplayer mods/servers that this game has. now for the only downfall i have come across when playing the game, you cannot play this on a low end pc, this game is very un-optimised and you need some powerful hardware to run the game smoothly. i have a gtx 970, and a i7-4790k and i still experience some bad framerates on certain servers and mods, so be warned you wont get 1000 fps, but that aside it is a amazing game. solid 10/10.",1
"not worth buying it. runs like crap even with better systems as recommandet. sry. bi but u ed it up again and after 2 years now its still a bloody mess...",4
"realistic sounds and graphics with a touch of robot like radio chatter, little bit buggy at sometimes but i recommend it to the people that like simulation games",1
"this game will make you love it. then it will kick you in the nuts and you will hate it. then you will love it again",1
"i have many, many hours of playing arma games but sadly no more. i was playing on battleroyale when i got the massage no player selected and was then kicked. when i logged back in the next day i had a global ban from battleye. be has never replied to a single email i have sent asking for their help. bohemia interactive did but stated they could not help. the upshot is that all of my be enabled games are no longer available and my only recourse is to buy all the games again in a new steam account - not a chance. i am not a cheat. buyer beware on this one. i love arma but will no longer be able to play and will not risk a single penny more until battleye at least have the decency to advise me why i was banned. bi should think carefully about who they work with. ban hackers..yes...but treat people as innocent until proven guilty and at least tell them why they were banned.",4
"arma 3 is that type of game where its not just a bloodshed battle but it has tactics and strategys that makes it realistic and fun",1
"epic open world game. ai could be better. a lot better.",1
"well....i cant really comment on a lot of this game, because i suck , but i can comment that my gfx card also sucks  and they optimized it enough that its playable for me. so....you know.",1
"well for starters the game seems like it could be really good. when i first got it about a mouth age i tried it out the frame rate wasnt the best but very playable the i finally decided to trying to learn how to play and load the game up and now im luck to get 10 fps. ive looked around and tried a bunch of different things the i found on different forms but nothing seems to help. i get the same frame rate on low settings as i do on high so really dosnt make sence. its really to bad because this game is exatly what i was looking for. update: i thought i would give it one more try and i hadnt changed anything and now im getting 40 to 60 fps on high settings in single player so hopefully it stays like i have no idea what was wrong before.",1
"still runs like a big pile of poopydoodoo. single player campaign is not finished. feels like a beta but it is the official release.",1
"an absolute great military sim! the commmunity mods are wondeful and the games editor/campaign is bugless and very enjoyable. overall, this games new mechanics and engine make it a must buy for an avid military gamer!",3
"amazing game. so much to do and hours of fun. it is worth paying full price 10/10",1
"this is an awesome game!! really realistic. so far everything that i could want in a shooter and more.",3
"this game is an amazing follow up to the second arma. a huge graphical improvemet, ui changes, and weirder keys replacing inventory with gernade, yeah that was fun to find out... another thing that makes this game amazing is the steam workshop, it adds, litteraly, hundreds of mods, missions and just fun things to do!",1
"i owned the game but now i have to buy it again??!!! this is stupid give me my game or money back!!!!!",1
"one of the best games i have ever played! some glitches but they will get ironed out after the developers spend there spoils and feel like being productive for more money... if you liked arma 2 you will love this.",3
"buggy as hell. they never fixed weird issues like being able to walk through walls. hard to tell when youve actually shot someone. no real visual indicator that youve shot someone, so you end up shooting them 5 times out of confusion. single player campaign seems badly thought out. i basically had to save scum to get off of the first island. ai is awful. no armory mode or quick mission mode. i regret buying this in alpha.",1
"while playing i take off my clothes and carry bloody men around while they float like ghosts behind me like ghosts",2
"one of the best games i have ever played. the amount of simulation aspects in it are incredible. and the steam workshop is like a never-ending dlc jackpot. 10/10",2
"never seen so many bugs in a final game (that is out for some month now). in general, it could be so much fun.. an open world, a sandbox with lots of vehicles and items. but everything is laggy and broken. i want my money back bohemia! -_-",1
"amazing game!, has many things to do and have never been bored playing. full of cheap dlcs you can easly spend 50+ hours on this game, for what it costs its worth it!",3
"this game is hella good you can go from helicopters, jets, boats, submarines, parachutes, on foot... you can do anything that you want freely the choice is up to you. you want too explore you can but... you always must use caution you never know if/when you will be shot at from any direction, any height, any distance and from any type of challenge wether its planes boats, tanks, mines, enemies aka troops and paratroopers you name it.. you can also create missions for you and your friends to play, you can also do anything set on your mind.. but you must follow server rules, if you dont want too be kicked/banned. you can also do solo missions, the campaign, training anything! this game has a ton of mods! so what are you waiting for buy now!!",5
"by far the best fps i have ever played. keep up the good work bohemia interactive, hope to see arma iv.",2
"i cant believe i spent $60 on this. i thought i was getting a bad  game, turns out that its just bad and im the  for buying it. think operation flashpoint, just wonkier and more complicated.",1
"i will quote a good friend of mine; steam winter sale ftw. arma is 50% off again - which makes it priced about right given the ery required to make it work all snazzy. best arma review ever. if you can run the gauntlet, this game is brilliant. if you expect to download something, and have it work, best wait awhile.",1
"bought the game - have been terribly unhappy with the slow rate of updates, the unoptimized graphics engine, and general lack of content. an open world with very little in it - not very much fun at all.",3
"do you like guns? do you like shooting things? yes? how about flying and shooting things?! then yes, this game is for you. solid gameplay, great to play with friends, this game really comes into its own in multiplayer where the situation can change moment by moment. yes the interface can be a bit clunky and sometimes you will enter an animation that seems to take for ever to complete - usualy when you are standing in the open with enemies on all sides but all that can be overlooked because arma 3 is an enjoyable game",2
"cant even explain how good this game is! love realistic shooters? theres no doubt you will like this. and if you dont, youre insane!",3
"not only is it one of the most beautiful settings in all of video games, it is the most accurate military simulator avalible, always great fun with large parties of friends, but you also meet great people by playing in game, recommend you get teamspeak for this game, and research some great mods, becuase it is a large community modded game which makes it even more fun. also watch some how tos before you play so youre not totally blind sided, also know this is not call of duty, the game involves tactics and survival instinct to play, you will get destroyed if you one man army in this game. only down side is you do need something relitivly powerful to run the game so look at your specs. otherwise great game.",1
"i played this game for 260 hours and it was amazing. i played with friends and then got banned by battleye for no reason...i am very dissapointed in be for global banning me for no reason. i do not cheat and the worst i have done is download mods in which arma 3 has mod support. arma 3 is a overall great game but the sixty dollars is not worth it.",2
"not many games will amaze me, but this one did. i did not belive that arma 3 would stand a chance to arma 2/oa but it gives it a good run for its money. only downside to arma 3 is the lack of weapons and vehicles but mods seem to patch that right up, good job bohimia interactive",2
"never fails to entertain, with all kinds of content and even more with mods. you will never run out of new things to do on arma.",1
"best game na such wow so yummy so much play time to fun wasteland is the best",2
"really enjoy playing this game. coming from cod and battlefield i love the realistic attributes to this game compare to the other two. battle royale is by far my favorite mode in this game",1
"what sort of idiot limits a game like arma to 2.5gb of ram? anyway sick game with a sick community",2
"best cod running simulator walk 10 meters, start having an asthma attack",1
"very first minutes: oh god oh god who shot me who shot me ?! 30 mins. later: i see you but i wont shoot you because i cant. 60 mins. later: ing campers ing campers ! 1 months later: sitrep grind 061357, enemy 200 metres r.u.a",1
"not worth the 60 bucks but i find its graphics to be a very nice upgrade to arma 2",2
"you have to play this game with friends because you cant play it without them, then its lame game. multiplayer is the best mods and everything make this game awesome.(you have to play this game with friends.)",1
"overall the game play is difficult and focuses on real life accuracy making the movement mechanics very frustrating to navigate. unless youre driving a land based vehicle, youre going to find piloting any aircraft a complete nightmare. the game looks great but has a very small variety of weapons to choose from, which in turn makes for some pretty bland game play. the enemies are all crack shots and can hit you from miles away even if youre in a concealed, prone position. i picked this up during a sale recently and still regret the purchase. lesson learned. will be avoiding any future bohemia interactive titles.",1
"i love the realism and the many game modes! and there are so many awesome workshop scenarios.",2
"havent played it for long it is a little laggy hope you fix that but overall good game",1
"if youre looking for a war simulator this is the game it is the best war game ive ever played graphics are amazing and the detail is awesome. it is so easy to get locked into this game ive played this for hours and never got bored great game.. thanks to the makers of this game for making such a realistic war game.",1
"its an awesome game that has a vast amount of gamemodes to play and explore. you should get it m8.",1
"really good game. heaps of mods and game modes comming out all the time. this game is a great investment for the future and i think everyone should have it in there steam library.",3
"best role playing game i have ever played in my life, asylum server i would suggest to play on if you want to role-play , 5 out of 5",4
"this game is worth buying just for battle royale alone. the controls are a little awkward, but with a bit of rebinding, youll be just fine.",1
"arma amazing game. do not buy if you have a dollar store/wal-mart pc. i love arma 3, super fun.",3
"unrefined and jerky -- describes every aspect of this game. even with the settings turned down the animations are horrible and the guns are garbage - i cant even hit a window on the side of a building. bohemia needs to take some pointers from other shooters, refine the animations, fix the guns so they actually can shoot someone, and fix the jerky animations and lag so that whopever you shoot at, is not ghosting and jerking around like someone having a seaizure. i wouldnt even call this and alpha build and this game has been out for years -- no excuses at this point. i want my money back, this game is garbage.",1
"great game....buuuuttt...almost mad i got it tho due to the servers all sucking and not nearly enough enemys in servers.... i need some tactical players to play with before i just uninstall this and go back to arma 2",1
"this game is a sandbox, and what you get out of it is what your imagination or the community behind you puts into it.",2
"eet ees good. i haz much fun. -10/-10 would bark again.",3
"its a nice game it is worth the money into my opinion.",1
"the best shooter ive ever played. the realism is immence, campaign is long and has a great storyline to follow it, multiplayer is difficult but spend a few days on it and youll get the hang of it",1
"pros: this game is just beautiful. very photorealistic! when i first looked around in the game it was like whoa!. i can max it on my gtx 980 in 2k at around 40-50 fps, multiplayer allows a large amount of people to play on massive maps. the controls are great, you can have total control over you player. weapon accuracy is realistic, you cant hit anything without being tactical. it has a great training section that i advise you play before jumping into a server. cons: the muliplayer... i just dont understand. i admit i havent done any research on how to play, i didnt know i had to. i have not met a friendly entity in any game yet. as of now every encounter with another play has resulted in them shooting me, tazering me or hancuffing me to sell to another more advanced player... there is nothing you can do about it, both the faction and the police have simmilar procedures. there are, it seems, 1k commands. it will take a while of remapping for comfort and accessability, let alone learning the bulk of them. conclusion: it looks great and is the most immersive fps i have ever played. so get it! very taxing game on the graphics card. screen shots look amazing, but the 45fps is not enough to be competative, so i will have to turn down settings =( or buy another 980 =)",1
"it is a very thrilling game with much action involed",1
"graphics 8/10 opitimized 4/10 gameplay 6/10 multiplayer campaign 7/10 mods 10/10 overall 6.5/10 now down to the deatils. the games graphics amazing looking. the opitmization. yeah thats not existing. its like dayz standalone in its early beta. so yeah... mods for it great. altis life, takistan life, city life, surfing, arma 3 life mod. really great game. plus overpoch. freaking amazing. now to the campaign... again... almost not existing. the campaign is about as boring as a math class would be on a friday afternoon. so would i recoomend tehe game? well if you only want to play the mulitiplayer and the mods then i definitly would recoomend it. plus if you rae into roleplaying games the mods for this game will be perfect for you. there very well designed and have great guis unlike somethign like gmod darkrp. now if you want a war simulator... no not the game for you... go back to arma",3
"arma 3 is an awesome, intense and realistic shooter ( besides the fact that you run for 10 seconds and then your character starts to waddle around) 8/10",1
"no matter what i try i cant get multiplayer to work. waste of money",1
"the only thing you need to know about playing arma 3 is that no matter what you do the game plays like . all arma games play like , it is a physics law. whether you have a i7 with sli 780s or a 8350 with xfired 7970s, this games your fps will change more than peoples opinions on ben affleck being batman. pros: workshop +++ replayability open map (a little empty though) engaging campaign (so far) intelligent difficulty (unlike arma 2) cons: the game engine need for tweaking for a remotely solid 60fps stupid animations the inventory system the designers made stupid choices on vegetation popping again rather then building a sound game. final comments: i love arma 3.... but i believe if someone made a bot filled giant cti mod for just cause 2. then i have no need to play arma at all.",1
"i rilly likke the game i want to buy it its so cool thif all off the severs",1
"i wish they done the sale up to 20th so i cold get it :(",1
"its pretty damn awsome, from gameplay to graphics this game is the bawlz.",1
"singleplayer is an exercise in pain on high difficulty. game overwrites autosaves and limits you to 1 save. prepare your body for an autosave with grenade launcher rounds inbound forcing you to restart. great roguelikelike.",1
"arma 3 compared to arma 2 is a big improvement for sure, but it stills has a few issues and features that where in arma 2 that i would have liked to see in arma 3. overall its pretty good now since there are some great mods that have come out.",3
"highly recomend this game to anyone who wants to buy it as there is no game crashing bugs, lots of fun in battle royal and for people who like a mixture of guns and drugs scareface style should really play altis life rpg.",1
"i fell off a building and my character was still standing so i thought he was okay but then he ragdolled into the ground. 10/10 2 hardcore for me",1
"really good game, with a large number of mods! buy it and play it!",1
"great game. i use the editor for dayz cinematics. actually i dont really know how the game is. if i ever play it, i play altis life. but i know a  load about the editor. 9/10",1
"love playing this game, 10/10...good fun with mates.",3
"$16.00 us for 2 bad helicopters, or to even be able to sit in the back seat of one no content no shotguns buggy like every other arma game realistic military/war simulation, helicopters and planes explode when they touch water. impossible to try and survive a crash landing even if you are hovering and descending 2 mph most  admins on any server its fun i guess.",2
"game is ok and all but if you expect it to be realistic then you are wrong have fun emptying more than half of your mag into a guy 50m away and he lives",1
"this is a awesome game! its a army simulation based game with no white dot on the screen to help you hip fire, you wont be seeing much of that. the vehicles are smooth with a steady internet connection. i would recommend that you practice your flying skills on single player to get the hang of it so when your in battle with 8 guys in the back you know what your doing.",2
"this game is amazing. no other game can compete. the amount of things you can do is outstanding from playing on a tatical server to just having fun with frends on a closed server. looks amazing, plays well and they keep on adding stuff! 10/10.",1
"arma 3 is as real as it gets in military simulation. i would rank the 3 main military simulator games like this; cod < battlefield < arma. i have played the arma series since arma 2 and i can say that this game requires more use of strategy and skill rather than the other two games listed above. it is not about shoot em up, get points, and level up. it is more like use your advantages and strategy against the enemy to push back or eliminate them. its about teamwork and large amounts of skill to win the mission. there are 2 huge islands in the game with tons of bases and towns on each. there are lots of mods and the multiplayer is fun when you find a good lobby. (i mostly play battle royale and annex). the single player is fun and long and the graphics are amazing if you have a good pc to run them. there are not as many vehicles in this than arma 2, but there are still a lot. the workshop makes getting add-ons a breeze. if i were to give a rating for this game i would give it a 9/10, with the -1 being around half the multiplayer lobbies having near empty or no people in them most of the time. other than that this game is a great buy for people looking for hardcore military simulators.",1
"i finally have a computer that will run this game. it is so fun! from battle royale to fighting against ai on 7th cav server you wont be dissapointed.",2
"this is a pretty cool games to play with friends and do some roleplay and coop",2
"cant tell you if you should buy it or not, but i can tell you this. you will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isnt there and lack of content if youre not satisfied with what you have. but when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, its something magical you just cant find in any other game. arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. you buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. arma is a game which you can never called finished. there will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. hope i expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :) if you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem! ill give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, ive used hundreds of hours on arma 3 that i would never take back. read: i will not accept random friend requests! if you have a question, please post it in the comments.",5
"spend 3 days hiding in a bush, get shot by someone you cant see. 10/10",3
"this is one the best combat simulators ive ever played. the sand box on here is a blast and the steam work shop is awesome for user created content. the only down fall for me is that i dont have anyone to play this with.",2
"called a military simulator but you can also do races, rob the federal reserve, transport illegal drugs and of course do military simulator stuff if that involves you defending a base against multiple tank battalions spawned by your friend who is the god zeus.",2

"pretty basic until you get mods for it. find a good community of gamers who game regularly and with good mods and this becomes one of the best games youll ever buy. im going to fail my degree because of this game. 10/10",4
"i downloaded the arma 3 demo (free weekend) to try and then removed it after the free period. now it doesnt show up in my steam library but it left behind 11gb of files which i have no idea if its safe to delete. theres certainly no option to delete them through steam as its not in my list of games. so i went to the arma 3 forum on steam to ask for advice and only people who own the game are allowed to post. seems like a very buggy game.",1
"my friend got downed and i carried him only to get shot in left nut 10/10",1
"arma 3 core is already pretty good , but with mods its epic.",1
"better than arma 2? yes. better controls, more controls, smooth gameplay and framerate, little bit futuristic, better community. top game!",3
"brill game but you do need a decent machine to wack up the settings. really good modding comunuity too.",2
"this is a very good game that is worth what i paid for it.",1
"best first person on the market. with gret graphics and game play highly recomended",2
"1. run cocaine wit ur bois 2. love your mother 3. make money 4. f**k bi**hes 5. ?????? 6. profit",1

"an awesome and probably the best military simulation. thanks to the very easy to use mission editor, a huge community and the integrated steam workshop, there is a multitude of extra scenarios and mods available. arma3 has plenty in store for you and will be around for another couple of years, as was arma2.",1
"sucks s**t if you dont have more than 5 frineds to play with",1
"do not buy this game if you are globally banned in dayz standalone. the battleye bans your entire steam account. so you are also banned from arma iii eventhough you have never played it.",1
"amazing is what the first a in arma stands for! if you liked arma 2, you simply must purchase this game! i bought it because it was on sale for $35 and i couldnt resist! this game has by far the best graphics i have ever seen! and if there was one big thing to complain about in arma 2, it was the campaign, which is now fixed and much to the liking of cod or medal of honor. buy this game and support bethesda for being awesome!",1
"best game ive probably ever played? i would really reconmend this game if you got a mate its brillant, its great crack, lots of laughs not buggy and fun to play even if your serious about it",3
"very fun i have had it for like 4 months and i never played it but once i did i was hooked",1
"wonderful game, but you can have a much better time with mods and a good group of friends!!! 10 out of 10",2
"if you like arma 2, you will probably like arma 3 too. graphics are great (if you have pc good enough). gameplay is as it should be for arma - tactical. i think this is the one of the most realistic war games out there. there is also a preety nice community - you can play community created king of the hill, wasteland, other missions. dont forget to grab a microphone because working with team is so much fun and is actually what this game is about - tactical teamplay. in short: if you like war simulators with great graphics, teamplay and nice community i would recommend you this game.",1
"a very hard but rewarding game. not like cod where you run and gun,you must play the game carefully and strategically. also this game is very realistic. this includes: bullet drop,fatigue,heavy weapon sway,penetration,and so much more. this game is truly the king of war simulators.",3
"this game is worth every cent. it is extremely realistic and has provided hours of fun for me and my friends.",1
"maybe someone can help me. ive been running arma for a few months and after about a month of playing my computer atomatically shuts the program down kicking me from the game completely. then it will let me back on the game for about 10 mins and do the same damn thing. why is this happening plz someone tell me whats going on.",1
"bestest, but hosting multiplayer servers should be done by nasa:",2
"we seriouslly dont need any explanation for this series. simply amazing and with the help of the community this get better every day, steam workshop is a dream come true for the arma series as it just make the game everlasting. from casual to hadrcore sim style gameplay, it is all here. why have you not bought this already :)",3
"an amazing games that will entertain you for a while, and the mods make the content on this game endless.",1
"while i love the arma series, this game was not was i was expecting. when you make a game, you have a couple things that need to be set up to make it a game. 1. a setting - they created the island, and it was good, very large and open with a diverse landscape 2. the engine - everything works well, even the physics, which arma 2 completely failed at. movements are fluid, you got way better animations, so there arent any complaints....until 3. weapons and vehicles - this is one of the most crucial points to add variety to a game, and i am sad to say that bi failed miserably. they created virtually nothing for the games release, for what reason i dont know, but it aggravates me to no end. you have all the things in place, the tools for people to make their own missions, but there is no variety, same guns, same ammo, and a couple of vehicles. look at arma 2, even without the dlc, there was tons of content to work with, and the dlc just added onto that. my advice? keep up to date on the status of the game, and once the first dlc comes out, then buy it",1
"this is a really fun game with infinite possibilities. but it is buggy as hell sometimes when i enter a vehicle i die instantly",1
"i hate the dlc system. you buy a game and can only enjoy a part of the content. i pay money for a complete game not for parts of a game. almost wish that pirating will be popular again, so game developers need to deliver great stuff to get the buyers back. with that said, its still a good game, but it could have been great!",2
"so within 5 minutes of playing the game i was approached by a player named megatron who offered me and my friend cocaine and $1,000. while high on cocaine a masked man came up and killed my friend. then some awesome medic in a helicopter revived him. shortly after someone kidnapped my friend and killed him while prenting to masterbate. im hooked.",1
"great game! but the problem is that it is too expensive. make it cost less and peoples will have more fun playing it with there friends, because right now arma 3 is forgotten cuz of day z. this game is without doubt the greatest war-sim ever, but yet it is way too expensive.",1
"good game more of a simulator though overall worth buying for 20",1
"it actually has a story. its not like anything else either. and it actually pulls you in, so its fun, because you know what youre doing, who youre fighting for, but very little about the enemy.",1
"alpha version of the military simulater arma iii. worth you time, if you enjoy tactical immersion!",1
"best shooter i have ever played, its not like other fps games, less arcade style and leans more towards realism but aside from that, the world of arma is just simple amazing and beautiful, very well made terrain and cities/towns, you can lose your self just wandering around.",1
"campaign is cool until you have to control your ai team... then it becomes kind of boring since the ai doesnt do quite what you asks of them and they end up dying pretty easily.. mods seems to be ok although if you are an arma 3 rookie its a little hard to play at first. cool game but wouldnt recommend it if its not on sale though.",1
"this game is a very good game with lots of expansions graphics are great",1
"realistic warfare to a whole different scale is armas specialty, giving players the unique experience to play simulated firefights between either pvp, or pve. for the most part, arma 3 has a good community. most people communicate with their teams to lead them into cities, complete objectives, or simply talking to a pilot to let them know where to drop you off. i do not recommend trying to play as a cod player in this, trying to use a sniper in a city, or trying to quickscope. youd probably die really fast. anyway, there were only some problems with arma 3, such as minor bugs (that are not that noticible; rare), or major bugs that havent been fixed yet. also, some players seem to take this game a little too seriously. ive seen many players who havent played the arma series and wanting to try to use vehicles for the first time. some players dont allow them as (obviously, being a beginner) theyre not good, or wasting precious vehicles that could have been useful. overall, its a great game, but dont take it too seriously and just remember its a game, not real life. graphics: 9.8/10 sound: 8.5/10 gameplay: 9.7/10 community: 7.5/10 overall: 8.9/10",1
"probably the best game for serious players who can work together to accomplish the mission.",1
"it is most best fun fur whole family. i love da bugs da loot and dag00t",1
"this game sucks... straight up....worst $60 game i have ever bought in my life... its boring...and the controls are stupid as ****",1
"if you think cod is the best game ever, then you have not played a real game. this is the most immersive and realistic military simulators (i cant even call it an fps, its so realistic) i have ever played. this will get you rblood pumping and adrenaline coursing, but only if you apreciate realism. cod sucks. bf is fun, but not anywhere even close to arma. i mean, come on. cod has zombies and now aliens, and people say thats realistic? this game is not a game where you are a total badass and can run in ad just kill everything. you have to run for cover, work with your squad, and be smart about taking down the enemy. love it.",1
"like 2, except with equipment that would be too expensive to outfit all of todays modern infantry with. oh, and the swimming and underwater stuff is nice. it still suffers from frame rate issues, unfortunately.",1
"not only is arma 3 a great military simulator without mods,with mods you will find yourself lost in the fun of all the mods have to offer.the mods include jumping out of planes to fight against other people,surviving in a world where you have to scavenge for equipment and weapons,and trying to escape an island while the island sinks and meteors crash all around you.all in all this game is a great game that you can enjoy alone or with friends. 11/10 would snipe again!",1
"great game. much better when you have a lot of friends you can play it with. solo isnt anywhere near as good",2
"best military simulator without any doubt! and also a big modding community! 10/10",1
"it is an amazing but i would say you need a strong computer to run it",1
"a lllllllot better than arma and arma 2 the game play and performance has improved, but still kind of a rage game especially when ai on normal can headshot you from 500 meters away with an assult rifle with red dot sights(ultra realism huh?) also you still die in like 3 shots",1
"after the 523 hr i have played arma 3 i have meet new friends i have joined and made groups and had some epic battles, its an amazing game, every thing is at it best in arma 3, the pyhisics, combat movments, wepons and many more! 10/10",3
"i would recommend it to someone who is new to the series...however..if you are a hardcore arma ii player like myself then do not buy this...unless you want to play altis life or some other crap.. this game was one of the biggest let downs",1
"great simulator! no wonder it won the award. its just at the right pace, not too fast, not too slow. theres no health regeneration, so if you get shot, youre either going to have to patch yourself up or just tread with a wounded arm or leg. best of all, no one fusses about it! theres no call of duty vs. battlefield wars, no ubisoft bandwagon hate. its just arma iii.",1
"i like shooter games, and i always saw my brother playing them and they looked very fun. when i was old enough, i got call of duty and had a blast. i kind of expected that kind of fun from this game, but i was dissapointed. even on beginner difficulty the soldiers take 30 minutes to kill, and you take 2 shots to the foot and you are dead whereas you can shoot them in the chest five times and they ill crouch and order their whole squad to fire on you with their unrealistically impeckable accuracy. if you like pulling out your hair and the feeling of overwhelming rage, this is the game for you. if not, you are wasting your money.",1
"well, personally i dont usually like fps because they are too un-realistic, this game changes everything. it is the most realistic possible fps ever made, i would say is more like a war-tactical simulator game than an fps. i liked this game a lot, even if it still has some bugs that must be fixed, but we have a very good developer community that makes the game more fun and with a lot of content. i highly recommend this game.!!!!!",3
"ive had this game since it was in alpha, and even though many updates have been released, i feel as if it has never left alpha. unfinished and plagued with bugs, it isnt worth 60 usd. pick it up on sale if you have a lot of money, but i cant reccommend it at its full asking price.",2
"blew up a helicopter with a flashbang conan/10 will die unexpectedly again",1
"this games brings really fun and is addictive :> great workshop and mods makes this game even better. really worth to buy if you are looking for something to play longer than 1 hour.",2
"love this game i would recommend it play it now now now!!!!!!",1
"arma 3 fixes almost everything that arma 2 had (gun handling, animations, physics, graphics, nighttime,flying,nvgs, etc) the best part of this game is the editor and mods because that is where the magic happens",1
"good game. can be a little hard for new players but worth the buy",1
"i just bought this game last night off steam and my arma 3 wont even connect to the servers or anything. the news feed on the main menu is supposed to say the latest news and . it always says news offline. when i go into multiplayer no servers pop up. i dont have any mods on it. this game is a waste of money. reset router uninstall and reinstalled and even verivyed files and still nothing.",1
"pros: -game play is extremely realistic -best shooter -massive multi player options -great for teamwork with friends cons: -only 24 hours in a day to play it :(",1
"one of the best games i have ever played, it supports mods (jsrs 2.1 and blastcorea3 are absolute must haves), always fun to play, huge maps (largest one has a terrain of 270*270 km without the water because its endless as far as i know), fluid animations, realistic ai (you cant just go on a stroll through an enemy bas (*ahem* call off duty)), and so on. i recommand it to anyone who wants to try something else, is a fan of realism or just wants to mess around and explode everything with the mission editor.",2
"well arma overall is one of the greatest games ever made the one and only problem pretty much is the fact it has horrible optimization and requires a nasa computer to run but other than that its a 10/10 game for me",1
"best game in the world armaa iii is one of the best games ive ever played in my life... cause its not just a war simulator... all the people would like this game cause : 1- if youre a kind of man who likes rpg games then you can just go and play arma iii altis life or the life mod... 2-if youre a kind of man who likes survival games then you can just install epoch or breaking bad mod and enjoy it 3-if you like pvp games you can just play arma iii wasteland or king of the hill or coop mod... so as you can see arma iii is just full of different mods and stuff... but people dont have same feelings...i like this game i my self but a guy with different feelings and needs would not . so youre the guy who chooses what to play i hope this review be helpful... and sorry for bad english :)",1
"best game ever 10/10 ing sooooo goood the game is jsut just so awsome and so much fun!",1
"this game has an better gamplay then arma 2 and its better, beautifull and big!",1
"great game. just passed through the 4th part of the bootcamp, and i am loving the game. when you get into firefight it is very tense and all you hear is gunshots and bullets flying past you, the vehicles are great to drive and to be driven in and the same goes for the helicopters that i have flown in up to now.",1
"a very good game for those who likes action & shooting. 12/10 would play. i really recommend this game.",2
"this game is the best war simulator you can get on steam, it cost alot, but its worth it. spend 100 hours in this game, enjoyed every single minute. recommended mods for this amazing game: breaking point(kinda fun) battle royale(most intensive  ever) epoch(same as breaking point, but with building, so its abit better.) arma3life(best roleplay, alot of new cars, guns. well it was fun atleast, when it was closed beta now its kinda shity.)",2
"arma 2 is an amazing game. however, i didnt really like the community, and the controls were very strict and complex. arma 3 doesnt change anything that makes arma arma. it still has very intricate controls, and even with the series hitting more mainstream notes because of day z and wasteland modes, arma 3 has just as many annoying guys yelling about chain of command and oh, you cant fly that helicopter into that mountain with our entire squad onboard in regular servers. if you want a fast paced arcade style miltary shooter, go somewhere else. if you want a military simulator which requires tactics and being super cautious, this is the most popular one out there.",1
"best opensand box,shooter,reallife game for pc out there!",3
"disappointing on several levels. essentially youre paying $60+ for an engine that mods run off. the mods that currently exist are pretty underwhelming, and arent made by the studio. they have universally low production value, and there are only a couple that are played. the insulting part is the engine isnt even good. its pretty slow no matter what settings its on, and this is with pretty decent hardware. maybe if you can get this game on super sale it would be worth it, but the amount of content in this game in no way justifies the price",1
"great game. shame bohemia has decided to go dlc on us.",1
"if you like being a terrorist (which i do) this game is perfect for you just simply set up car bomb and blow up infidel no problem!",1
"great game. go either in third person or first person and you can still have a lot of fun! role-playing in the game mode altis life has been awesome and hilarious so far as well as playing the game modes deathmatch and king of the hill! although bohemia interactive never optimize their game... 8/10. outstanding gameplay but lack of optimization.",2
"absolutely the best game i own. worth all 60$ of it. already have 100+ hours and have barely even dug into altis life alone. there is so much you can do in this game, and its all beautiful, because the graphics in this game are amazing. 11/10 would recommend to anyone.",2
"very interesting choice, i love it, this is my favorite multiplayer game. i play in a milsim unit and have led them before too. it is best with a group of people; seeing as it is a military simulator this would make sense. i enjoy it very much and my favorite role is to be a pilot. if you are a casual then you can play on vannilla and there are plenty of those. if you are into a little more of a challenge than you may want to go in to tactical realism or milsim. it is very fun but can be demanding on your computer, also it has a few glitches and may seem expensive. the choice is up to you. odds are that you probably would have already gotten the idea of what the game is like from the preview. this is one of those games where if you are interested you will probably like it, but dont pass it down if you are curious. -message me if you wanting to join a milsim unit. have fun! worth the price!",4
"guys this game is awsome!. this game is not like call of duty were you just spray and pray for kills or battle field were its a bit the same as cod ,its a game were you have your own inventery which holds ,range finders,your gun, back pack,t -shirt and all these other things.the graphics are quite good and really love the online servers but ther is not much campaign cuz its quite a new game :(. as youve seen the trailer you now that there ar lots ov cars and tanks and other things. i hope this has helped you pick if you want the game or not . see you folks bye",2
"best game i own. 300+ hours. strongly recommend it",2
"omega squad members run me over with vehicle. 10/10 would play again.",2
"if your computer can play it on at least normal settings with 30+ fps, must buy! 11/10.",5
"so much fun playing the game along with friends. the single player has alot of fun working with players to take down your enemy.",2
"buy if you like hacking and greiving! highly recommended if you are a cheater! enjoy",1
"i was never a big fan of simulators let alone military simulators, but the first time i played arma 2 i fell in love. although, i never bought arma 2 i did buy arma 3 and holy crap was it amazing. amazing graphics, an amazing aresnal, and an amazing game. there is many glitches and long waits to do a mission, but you can see through that and notice the beauty arma 3 gives. there is many fun game modes and even mods to spruce up the adventure. so, pick up a gun a helmet and get out there solider.",1
"any arma 2 player will enjoy the engine updates but as of now it is lacking content compared to arma 2 but it is slowly getting there. great mods and great updates.",3
"good game yes it is headed in the wrong direction however because it is going down the same track as most mmogs they are asking to much money for the simple things in the game that should be part of the game for free not to long a go it cost $90 or so for any game and you had funn for a long time now the greedy bean counters want it all killing the gaming industry and making it for the rich in most cases not all cases the not so well to do games do not cost much the top end stuff costs to much.",2
"great graphics and gameplay for just the alpha version! i recommend buy the alpha because you also get beta, and the full version when released.",1
"great game, by far the most realistic looking army game out there !!",1
"if you are looking for another fps to play like cod, this is not for you. this game brings a much larger meaning to combat oriented games. the situations that you have to adapt to, the fact that the map is about 19 sq. km, and how fluid everything is compared to arma ii, thesse are all factors of the this game that stand out to me the most. this game is not for any cod player (or battlefield at that) that just wants to shoot people for fun. once you get used to everything and how the game is played, it really latches on to you. especially when you have some buddies to bring with you.",1
"simply the best militry simulator on the market, even if you dont like that aspect you can play the famous mods like wasteland and altis life. you dont even need a mod manager for that (arma 2). its defently an improvemend to amra 2.",1
"so many game modes and mods, why wouldnt you want th is game?",1
"very fun to play, my favorite game modes are altis life, king of the hill, and wasteland. overall great game.",3
"good game but not worth 40.00, id say wait for sale before buying, need good pc to run at decent fps and keep the game looking not",1
"i love this game! when it works... lately ive been unable to play multiplayer (any type of singleplayer mode works fine) as it just causes my computer to freeze when i join a lobby. it forces me to quit the game through the task manager (doesnt always work) and even then causes things to not work at all forcing to do a restart. its a shame as the game itself is amazing... sadly there doesnt seem to be any clues as to why this is happening or of a fix, even though there are several reported instances of this happening from many other people. hopefully someone figures out the cause of this and it gets fixed.",1
"i highly recommend this game. very realistic, very hard. what i like most about this game is the combat is not over in 5 seconds like most action game eg call of duty. also with all the wide range of guns and very unique future vehicle makes this game incredibly fun.",4
"do not compare this game to battlefield or call of duty. its a slow paced, tactical shooter that requires teamwork. not for the impatient or lone wolf. excellent community and nowhere else have i been able to work with 40+ people efficiently and effectively on an objective in a video game. lots of fun.",1
"this game definitly made my top list of greatest games. yes it may have some bugs, but the possibilities for the types of scenarios that you run into is just amazing. this game is not like any other ordinary fps. its classified as a combat simulation game, and it does not let down. so if youre tired of casual shooters and want to try something more in depth, then i reccomend this game.",3
"breathtaking graphics, fantastic gameplay, and a superior feeling to the controls since arma ii. the mod community are already blowing up on this. for those who enjoyed arma ii this is a must buy. for those new to the arma series, jump straight in on this, get moding, get building scenarios and i guarrantee youll never play cod or battlefield again.",1
"yeah i highly recommend this game to all people who like realistic type shooters and if you have played arma 2 im sure you would also like the massive improvemnts and features added. and this game has many fan made mods like altis life, wasteland and king of the hill to get stuck into. the delevlopers have made it very easy to mod in new models, weapons etc. this is a great game and im looking forward to future dlc and features. :)",1
"reminds me a lot of dayz. it doesnt have any zombies, and it isnt as pick up and play as day z either. 10/10-ign",1
"love this game. so modded, there are endless ways you can enjoy. fly a chopper, drive a tank, do a mission, play koth, endless game play with this engine. pm me if you want details and the latest mods to try out. always down to form up and show a noob the ropes.",5
"arma 3 takes it a step further with then its predecessor with enhanced ai, gripping storyline and immersive campaign. the campaign is split into 3 parts, each released seperately. this keeps you on hold slightly but its worth the wait. also the multiplayer with the use of mcc sandbox is great fun.",3
"the game is awesome, it has some very good servers like wasteland and altis life. also breaking point mod is very good, but you need to download it separately. weapons and vehicles are very nice to play with. however you need very.. very awesome gaming pc to run it on highest settings and if you can play 100 player altis life server on ultra settings with 60+ fps, thats quite an achievement, i mean damn. warning, dont buy this game if you plan to play it on a laptop or a computer that can barely run other big games. +very playable and good looking even with lowest settings +awesome servers and mods +sea, air, and land modern combat -sometimes it runs like a potato if you dont have expensive computer",3
"yeah i reccomend it as i crash all the time but im hoping to fix that soon and the times ive been able to play it was a fun time killing ai",1
"best game ive ever purchased in my lifetime. the modding community is off the charts along with the game itself. if you have the money. i reccomend purchasing it with no regrets. best on steam in my opinion.",2
"first thing im getting once its 75% off (bless the family sharing and thank you tora). pure gem for military sim, with next-gen icing on top.",1
"excellent simulator for those who prefer their gaming sessions to be immersive and deliberate. it doesnt run very well and is far from perfect, but theres no one else on the market who does what arma does, simply because its very hard to.",5
"arma 3 is almost like arma 2, besides alot of gameplay has changed! the guns now have attachments you can take on and off, clotching that you swip out with a dragn drop on. body armor actually works in this game, and mostly everything else does aswell great game overall, i would highly recommend it if you have a beast computer as the maps are huge and eats up your framerate! :)",3
"not recommended just buy a bf3 or bf4 you will enjoy for long long looong time.",1
"arma 3 is a great advancement from arma 2, it still holds the fun aspects of gameplay but comes with bigger, better more modern equipment and rifles. also it comes with a wide range of aircraft including remote control drones, i would recommend this game to anyone wanting to have fun for a good price as there is many different types of severs.",2
"clunky as hell, glitchy, poorly optimized, server browser never shows any servers, and the ai is the most potato thing ive ever laid eyes on. and yet... its still really fun.",2
"very good game. the mods you can get make it even better.",1
"extremely tactical, incredibly fun to play with friends. for people looking for a real military spec ops feel this is the game to get. the giant maps and the ability to edit and create your own missions allows for infinite possibilities of gameplay.",1
"dont get it for full price, it isnt worth it. not at all.",5
"cooperative gameplay across a massive battlefield. complete freedom to execute missions as you see fit. indescribable customization of every aspect of the game, from the clouds to the mission you play. it is all able to be catered to your liking. if you can think it, you can play it.",5
"great game, can have all out wars or simply moddify it to be a roleplaying game. but non to less its a great game with lot to do. zeus is a blast with friends making missons on the go.",2
"not for the faint of heart, this is not call of duty, or battlefield, i say again this is not call of duty, or battlefield. if you want a realistic fps where the enemy is truly unforgiving and every second and choice can lead to life or death, this game is for you this is the closest you will get to combat without actually being there in a game.",1
"if you are creative and enjoying creating your own missions and playing with your friends you will like this game. the community has made some great mods for this game also.",5
"brilliant game, can use some help though some bugs are annoying..",1
"a well made military simulator with a great community. the game puts you right in the action during those tense moments when the bullets flying around you could kill you in one or two hits, making every battle decision worth thinking over. missions with a team could never be more realistic then when you are just a band of gamers who have never met before, hunched over your computers and just barely making a dent in the opfor forces. even when you are on the move to the action, the game still keeps your attention. the moments when you are completely oblivious, then suddenly ragdoll to the ground with the respawn screen popping up really teach you to be aware. overall, arma iii is an amazing game that made a lasting impression on me, considering im new to the series. originally buying it to play altis life, i soon found the rich treasure trove of content this game holds.",1
"great game i just dont like the fact that bans carry over from game to game.",1
"you can play this title as a cod/bf shooter, a rts, a milsim etc. and its perfect in every of this senses! the game got made so that you can play it on every pc/laptop you could imagine. it runs everywhere but of course the graphics arent as good as on a gaming pc. the game fearures (the in my opinion) biggest and greatest community ever. there are hundrets of great addons, and they are all free! in conclusion: this game has everything for everyone. deticated server for lan-parties, very variable difficulty, great graphics, a giant open world, a free in-game editor and much more. simply a must-have!",3
"several steps in the right direction over arma 2. the new bullet projectile mechanics are top-notch.",2
"ok this game require to train to fully appreciate it value. the game is not hard but its unforgiving. you will die a tons! it make dark souls look like candy crush. but take the time to learn how to pilot, how to command and install some recommanded ai mod like ffis and i promise you a superb gaming experience. arma3 is unique! but you will never forget your first success. this is no wonder why the community is so productive with this game. you really can simulate anything! just take the time to learn it! its a sure buy ! the only con against this game ? it require a monstrous pc to be played correctly i run a i7 4930k/32gig@2400mhz/2x ati 7970 on an 2560x1440 screen and this is not very fluid i often run between 40-60 fps but nothing more. because the pace is rather slow the fps slowdown is not really a big issue. just be aware of its hardware requirement",1
"i got dayz sa... wasted over 500 hours! got arma3... drank tea with god for 50 hours!",1
"this game can be a lot of fun when played with friends. however, the computer ai is sometimes horrendously unpredictable and the game has a few minor bugs. other than those flaws the game looks amazing running on ultra. if you like to explore sandbox type games, this comes highly recommended from me.",2
"arma 3 in short! the good: - nice graphics - good sound (guns etc.- but some problems with 5.1 ss) - large map - lots of gear - mp - coop the bad: - the ai (it sucks aaaasssss, like no other i have ever seen - really, both your team mates and the enemy) - animations and the movements of soldiers are robotic* (with ai) - (mp) server lags with large no. of players",1
"i like this game mostly for breaking point but i will still play the game",1
"really, really, reaaally heavy, overrall great, except for graphics on anything less than an r9 290.",1
"i was playing an rp mode called altis life. me and a friend decided to do some heroin runs to make some easy money. we spent all of our money on trucks and supplies needed to collect heroin we went to the field, picked as much heroin as we could hold and went back to process it. on the way home we saw an unoccupied offroad on the side of the road. my friend drove past it and it blew us up randomly. 10/10 would do it again",2
"i dont see any point to having paid what i did for this. what i got, was a beta with a map. i expected to see huge improvements in this game and i havent seen any. would rather get a refund than have a license for this.",1
"i think the game is alot of fun couse of there being so many mods and that makes it a large amount of different styles of the game and that makes the game worth buying in my opinion. there just comes out more and more type of mods for the game, some of them are good and some of them are not as good. the mods i like the most is the rp/life mods. the game looks good in my opnion and its worth buying if u like a game were there is alot of different things to do in it.",1
"so realistic its like a way better open world battlefield",1
"very fun game with a lot of mods and a lot more always coming into the game definetly worth buying if you can run it.",4
"have you ever seen a platoon of soilders advancing towards the enemy by shuffling on thier butts, legs stretched fowards? no? well now you can! experience the ultimate leaning and awkuard stance simulator, arma iii promises to deliver the biggest  raping any game has ever given to you. and i promise you that when you see the enemy you will  all kinds of runny solids, because these arent just regular guys, these are regular guys dressed up in futuristic bug suits, they have party ballon animals, they have goats and they have weird helmets. buy now or forever be dissapointed that you didnt get to experence dragging your  all over the 19km island of stahpthis.",1
"arma 3 is a really good game. if you feel like a real army game, go and play arma, good tactics etc makes your team win. for the roleplayers out here, they are also at the right addres, arma has an rp mod called altis life this is fantastic for people who love rp with good graphics. i really recommend this game for actually every player who loves an army game and for people who seek real roleplay",2
"this is a military sandbox game ive never seen before..with mcc 4 mod i can make my own custom mission easily. but i dont know how to make a character modelling as a new unit. im not a 3dsmax / blender expert so can anyone show me the way to do so..actually now i want the indonesian armed forces pack so bad..",1
"it is a lot of fun if you have friends to play with.",2
"a3 is the definition of a military simulator. ive played many other first and third person shooters but none have quite caught the real perspective of what its like on the battlefield. in fact my first mission on a3 was horrifying, i died three times during the mission and saw my own allies turn on my men in an instant. for all cod fans forget quickscopes, and 360 no scopes because arma 3 brings you the best battle simulation you will ever play. real men play arma 3",1
"when you play multi-player most people do no get over 60 frames per second 20-40 fps is average i would suggest googling average fps arma 3 etc. my pc easily meets the recommended game settings but after doing alot of research it seems like the game is not optimized and people are happy playing a game with low fps. i play alot of first person shooter and fps makes a big difference so be carefull buying this game as i regret it.",1
"its fairly rare for me to write recommendations in general, and its even rarer for me to find a game that ill keep coming back to after the 100 hour mark. arma 3 is definitely one of those games. im in no way saying its finished mind you. there are some occasional bugs, and sometimes the ai is really  or has laser rifles that pistol kill you from 1000m away (not so frequent anymore) but for what it offers, and what can be added via mods, this is one of my all time favorite games. if you have even one friend playing with you, youll have hours of fun. its really unbelievable how much you can do, and how much you keep coming back for even after frustrating encounters or missions. theres something for everybody in arma 3 (theres even a fishing mod for all you nonviolent pansies.) and it really provides a framework for you to do what you want with it. in all honesty, i am hard pressed to name a game that allows you the ease of introduction and ramps up to advanced techniques so smoothly. the more you play, the better you get (obviously) and ultimately, you decide how and what you want to play. the game goes on sale occasionally, so id wait til then, although i bought it full price and never looked back. its one of the very few unfinished games that i dont regret buying.",2
"not perfect, but in its core mechanics the best arma available. with weekly updates in devbranch, thousands of missions in the workshop and with mod integration into the workshop coming soon it will last a long time.",2
"very fun game when you can run it. this game in its original state is bad but the mods make it fun note: this game is badly optimised and very demanding",1
">went on altis life >started smuggling drugs >sold drugs >bought a gun >mugged people >gets caught >kills police >is #1 most wanted criminal >goes to a peach field to get food >gets shot on sight 10/10 would be a criminal again.",1
"great shooter simulator! singleplayer might be boring for some people, but the online experience with a great community will give you a great time.",3
"if you never played operation flashpoint, arma 1 , arma 2 , day z mod , day z standalone, or any other military shooter this game is not for you and if you have, this is the best military simulator ever made.",2
"this game is awesome. one of the best military simulators out there. tired of dayz but not the franchise? arma 3. have fun.",1
"if your stuck with csc and battle field then your missing out on great millitary games go right across you deadly cross hairs because arma is a more realistic simulater of battle so if you here a single pop or crackle you may experince the real army feeling of fear. arma 3 contans great single player and multiplayer action with multible modes to choose from my personal favoret altis life which is and rpg mode. arma 3 also has realistic shooting (as in not so easy to hit someone) with out being careful. i suggest arma 3 to any 1.",2
"lots of buttons to learn, other than that its a awesome game and has tons of replayability 8/10 for me!! worth it too..",1
"this game is like being underwater. but the water has been replaced by feelings of isolation, claustrophobia and bullets. bullets hatefully fired at your face by nameless and unseen minions. and these bullets dont stop. until you stop...moving.",1
"with graphics made of clay and a price tag that is as bad as a call of duty game, this is truly the best shooter experience of the decade. this review is powered by nvidia phyx",1
"i played arma before dayz came out. now its so ing mainstream. im tired of this .. . dont even buy this crap. its terrible and everyone who plays is either a giant  or a  12 year old .",1
"if theres ever been a game for everyone its arma 3. the graphics are spactacular and the engine never stops amazing me. there are many multiplayer modes that inculde everyone from king of the hill to altis life the glories are endless! 10/10",1
"as an arma veteran, i personally recommend this game to anyone who likes the arma series.",2
"a superb military simulator(and shooter?), imo its better the call of duty and battlefield games. a great leap forward from arma 2, everything is better! the graphics, animations, controls, sounds, performance, etc. it runs very smooth on my pc, and i almost forgot, its still in beta",1
"just... get it... just get it.... you need this.... 10/10 no doubt",2
"absolute crap in recent updates have always been a loyal arma player but optimization in the last few updates have made the game unplayable on mid-high range systems you need a beast of a rig to run this game now i stronlgy reccommend for the averge player dont waste your money on this anymore",1
"you enter combat with your team/squad, hop in a chopper, fly to destination, parachute in, forget to pull chord, fall to death. would jump again 10/10. in all honesty, i would say get this game. its hard to learn, but it gets so good once you learn how, and you get into a combat zone, and bullets are wizzing by, jets flying overhead, and then you hear an explosion, and the house on the next block is destroyed.",1
"youre sitting here reading this when you could be playing it. what are you doing. hit that buy button bro. do it. why are you still reading cmon man buy the game. i dont got all day if you really scrolled down wtf. nope. such comments much caps very arma wow buy it.",1
"this game should be free i think people who made this game wants money so much that he made this game cost",1
"really good game and there is always something new to do if you get bored of one game mode. you have complete control on editor and there are many other online game modes to choose from. if you were thinking about getting it , i really recommend you do.",5
"a worthy set in the arma trilogy, it takes place in the future which allows for more unique weapons/vehicles, though this some times can feel like a discomfort. vehicles, weapons, and movements at disposal are all vasely improved and refined as well. with such an active modding community and develepors that are constantly improving the game, this is an expierence you cant disregard. and for the graphics the lighting effects are the best ive ever seen in a video game (ever).",4
"glitchy, unfinished, overhyped, overpriced game finishing dlc, carried on the back of dayz and semi popular arma 2 mods, constantly broken controls, horribly unoptimized, and the most unrealisitic realistic shooter out there. garbage at its best.",2
"arma 3 is a real game with all the workshop items and dlcs and game modes that expands the game i rate this a 10/10",1
"its a pritty decent game but t its current stages its not well optimized and quite a challange to run.",1
"great game for hardcore gamers cant wait for what more is to come in this game",1
"this game is over a ing year old and still $60?!?!? ing jews",2
"one of the best simulators ive ever played! a player has it all in this military sim! a first, or third person shooter(not like call of duty.)with a more expansive 360 degree of freedom! flight simulator with helicopters galore ,as well as aircraft! a knockout physics engine and easy to learn moding interface with true sandbox feel!!! use the editor to build yourself a custom mission and if you wish share it with the steam community via workshop. hear the crake of shots wiz by your head! you also get the best multiplayer experience i have ever had. with coop missions or, player vs player everyone out for themselves!! however remember that at anytime a well placed sniper round to just an ai soldier you didnt see can end it all at anytime!!! this is not just another game, its a chance to try to fill a real soldiers boots!!! arma iii, a great imersive experience!",1
"watch the showcases, (theyre old but you should be able to find them) theyre about 14 minutes long and show off lots of cool features, including disguises and much more. this game is not finished and needs to be updated still.",2
"not only a military game, a roleplay game, a sandbox, any game you want it to become. just apply some mods and *bam* its a whole new game!",1
"campaign is hard, even on easy difficulty. but it is possible. what i most prefer about this game is the multiplayer, open world, loot and a good community. theres tons of different servers with custom gamemodes, some of them are pretty awesome. but, i flow a helicopter into a tree. 10/10",1
"like spending 20 minutes driving only to get enemy casd from so far away you cant even hear it yet? 9/10 will continue to be casd again.",1
"this game is amazing to play, the modding scene is unreal and the game play is as realistic to war as i have found. however there are some downsides for example when online the game is useless without a mic and gets boaring without a friend, also you do need a beastly pc to run at high graphics settings, and still you will find lag spikes when in a city or when there is alot going on, but overall i would recomend this game for hours of fun and to those who like a challange.",1
"longtime fan of the operation flashpoint/arma games. arma 2 is my personal favorite, but this one is more polished.",1
"this game is really good. (a must buy for open world gamers)!!!",1
"now arma 3 is a awesome game but were here to talk about more than the fact its awesome, graphics are amazing well the way i can run it, arma 3 can bring someones fps to -100 depending on your comp. so if it is lagging i highly suggest you lower the settings down alot. what can you do on arma 3: you can do atlis life (alot of role play, it has a bank and cops so there you go), battle royale (hunger games but in arma 3), dayz brecking point (arma 3 dayz mod) now about brecking point its a pain just to login to it so i suggest you play atlis life and battle royale, and it is a 1rst/3rd person shooter i rather allways be in 3rd person for certin reasons that im not gonna disscuss. there is alot more gamemodes but those are my things. is it worth the money, depending on your comp. yes as allways my rateing for this game is 10/10 remember this is all my opion so do not think its all here. thanks for your time",1
"great game. would be great with more weapons and a useable bipod. controller support is great; just a few button maps dont seem to work. awesome game overall. 9/10 would eat.",2
"one of the best games i have played. 10/10! it has great graphics, gameplay and an all variaty of guns, vehicles and has a ton of servers.",1
"a great game, and great break away from the aa mainstream games like cod and battlefield",1
"buy it, learn it, enjoy it! be sure to play with others as this game is not meant to be played solo. although arma3s single player campaign (the first two chapters) is amazing, thrilling and just plain crazy the game itself is meant to be played with others!",5
"waste of money even the real weapon doesnt move alot when you aim. graphics was good but when you aim its moves around alot dont know what they are trying to prove. even when i fire my m249 machine gune i can zero like in cicle but the weapon inthis game sucks.",1
"absolutely love this game. best simulation game i have played in a long time. so happy i found it!",3
"arma 3 as lots of other people have stated. isnt your average shooter. youll probably need a decent rig to run it for starters and after that you will need to scrap everything you ever thought you knew about shooters. the campaign is fun and gives new players a way of grasping the basics of what combat is like in the arma world. for extreamly rookie players there are some good tutorial scenarios in game already loaded. a good addition to the series which will help anyone unsure of how to play. as for multiplayer and user made missions. your experience in those is entirely up to the mission creator and wether or not you choose to play with friends or a dedicated arma group. my reccomendation is join a group or find a server with a game mode you love. replayability is huge and basically infinite i would highly reccomend the purchase of this game.",2
"if i got stuck with one game only in my library it is this. the possibilities it offers and the community that support it make it a winner. that said it has its issues. needs a strong cpu and decent to perform very well, going against the rule of thumb in modern pc gaming. additonally there are lots of bugs and issues that still need address. unfortunately a lot of them have existed in previous titles too. there is positive development progress all the time though. arma 3 aims for and achieves something which no other game does.",3
"very fun game, and gets better with higher graphics. if your computer can run games with really high graphics, and you enjoy playing games like arma, then definately go for this game. my pc has decent specs with minor touch-ups here and there, and it ran fine for me during the one weekend it was free to play.",1
"ai is useless. i get injured and walk back to 10-15 friendlies, start calling out injured because i dont have a med kit. nobody responds. try again, one ai says hes coming. stands there not doing anything. took me 5 minutes to get my crew into a jeep, and 30 to get them out. this game uses every button on your keyboard, but none of them are labelled. this game tries to be realistic by making you walk an hour to get somewhere, but then once you try to actually do anything its a clunky mess.",1
"good game, good graphics, flying cars, broken physics 11/10 would fly again",3
"i love this game so much. the only downside that i have about it is when i join up on an altis life server, a lot of the police will just shoot you on site without you doing anything illegal. there are other servers though that the police are actually amazing and will role play well with you as long as you are not rude to them. overall its an amazing game and i love it so much.",1
"if you think cod or cs or bf is very easy for you, or you are a hardcore gamer that likes fps games, then this game is for you. it has scuba diving, grenade machine guns, artillery that you can control, even more realism, drones, ghille suits, immersive character customization, great modding community, no need to unlock weapons (you have to find them in the field first.) and even more! i highly recommend this for those of you who were in the military, those of you who have airsoft as a hobby or if you just like fps games in general. 10/10 however there is consequences. when i started playing the game (after the zeus free dlc was released.) i had a hard time getting past the first mission. but thats ok. edit: if arma 4 ever comes out, i hope it continues from the end of arma 3s campaign. it should continue from what bohemia interactive thinks is the proper ending.",2
"very good wish i had it played it for free and it is amazing",1
"this game is a must to have is alot just only a game specially multiplayer online!! if u got the money buy it if not save some and get it :p :d for me this game is a must for a warfanatic",4
"great mods for this game... the game style and feel makes it seem realistic.",1
"i tried to love arma 2, but i rarely ever felt like i was having fun. everything just seemed like such hard work. on this basis i didnt buy arma 3. a mate got it for me as a gift about a month ago. i have been playing it almost non-stop ever since. the graphics are better, the game play is better. its still far from the perfect game, but everything that was in the arma 2 package is here but better. for me this game is about the total being greater than the sum of its parts. this game is still hard, with sometimes sluggish controls, and basic graphics, but when viewed in context of the true scale and depth of what they have acheived is it quite amazing. it still feels like there is more for the series to acheive, but based on this improvement curve arma 5 will come with a free box of kleenex. the gameplay is certainly not for everyone. dont think war game, think sandbox battle simulator. if you are unsure about making the committment i would suggest buying arma 2 for a song and giving it a try. although not as good, the gameplay still gives a taste of what you can expect from the all round better arma 3.",2
"this game is a branch in a dynasty of games, that have been plagued by bugs, glitches and errors alike. some are really funny, some are plain frustrating. all together, the game can let itself be hated, yet, the player will likely clock many, many hours none the less. why? because in what other game, you get to play in a variety of gigantic maps, to play epic missions, made by good mates? in what game, will you play in tense, long-duration military environments with complete strangers? this game will let you experience open-world combat simulation at its finest. along with bugs. and glitches. and desyncs. but considering the overall awesomeness of the game, those eventually become quite funny, or at least acceptable. reccomended for: the patient, mature teamplayer the military addict not reccomended for: the immediate-satisfaction gamer",5
"too many bugs. cant finish the first campaign due to a bug. multiplayer is boring, very slow paced.",1
"cant say enough good about this game, so much more fun than the run and gun games. i enjoy making missions and playing them with my friends, the mod community has to be one of the best ever... other than some bugs here and there which i know the game is constantly being improved upon makes it one of my favorites, if you are tired of the generic run and gun shooters and want a game that actually makes you have to think , ammo count, health, team members, this is the one. i got tired of the others. (wont mention their names ) they kept tweeking them and wrecked the games for me. so you could say i got tweeked right out of them. i am a little over a half century old and have been gaming for many many years. the operation flash point days were a blast, and to see this evolve into what it is today is just great. if i could add anything to this game, it would be the ability to jump, and maybe a flame thrower tank. and the ability to put c4 on a small drone :) i recommend this game for fun",2
"great gameplay, from karts to killing ai baddies. recommend over and over. another beneful part about arma is all the free add ons such as battle royal.",1
"i got shot and waited for a medic, in that time i took a crap and got a drink. still waiting. 10/10 would crap again",1
"so much lag, even wtih the resolution turned down. i want my money back.",1
"arma 3 is a good game and all that stuff but it the most glitchy and laggy gameplay in any game. one of the glitches is not getting into a vehicle but nonstop searching it for weapons so i had to give up a helicopter for that glitch. unless if you want to be realy mad at how you die in about 2 shots and have to giveup vehicles do to glitches thats fine but im sure nobody wants to die in 2 shots and loose about a hour of work getting guns then dieing from thirst or teamkillers / hackers.",1
"i have the best graphics card and the best processors... game still lags to shitville.",2
"if you like dayz kinda action, and you are willing to rpg. altis life mod for arma 3 is verry cool, look up a good community and get your life going. get a job: pick apples, peaches, mine for iron, copper, salt and even diamonds. become a criminal, and pick, process weed, cocain or heroin. become a cop, arrest ppl. search vehicles, and hunt people that have a price on their head. you can even become a rebel. before you get a life on a server, read the rules of a server, the rules may vary on each server, if you want to become a cop, most of the time they want you white-listed. the server i play on the most: serverfilter: trinity join me.",2
"after almost 500 hours of playing arma 3, i still love it. yes, it does have points, where you most likely will say something along the line oh arma, why did you do this? but on a global perspective, the game is amazing and with its mods, maps, etc. it will give you a lot of opporturnities to play with.",4

"4th milsim game from bohemia. this is by far the best one. the campaign isntt currently released, but you can still get many hours of fun in the mission editor :)",2
"this is a realistic shooter, with teamwork and everything. at some points you can be so immersed into this game that you think you are a real soldier that is fighting in a war. i also think this is a game that people would say buy this game for me to their friends or family for the holidays.",1
"good game but hard to use the control on key pad as im stuck on a mission.",1
"tons of fun in this amazing game! and if you find a cool group of friends to play with even better, but this is your cod of bf game, you need to take it slow.",1
"this is a really fun game, if you liked arma 2 you will enjoy thing game a lot =p",1
"helicopter shot down by an ai jet. i manage to escape with a parachute. land on a land mine. 10/10",1
"mechanics are improved though still has some bugs but what is arma series without those wtf moments",1
"cant say enough good things about this game, especially in co-op mode. makes the call of duty series, and even the battlefield series, feel like arcade games. the realism it achieves elevates it above all others as a true combat simulator.",2
"arma 3 is incredible. if you are looking for a game that gets as real as possible this is it, its not even a game its a war simulator. missions are satisfying and even when they go bad its an unforgetable time.",1
"with all my due respects. but go frag yourselves. srsly? 50% on arma and literally nothing for those, who already bought the game? also: your interface still sucks (like in all armas i have played). downrated. for a reason.",2
"put this game on sale again do it now please now do it ple",1
"this game has a massive emphasis on realism. that means the graphics are realistic. and everyone knows realistic graphics need a good graphics card for a computer. and everyone knows they need a good computer to have a good graphics card.",1
"arma is such a strange game in some ways. theres always two sides, and not in the enemy and ally way ;) on one side it offers an almost unique experince (certainly in the previous series) of playing a game seriously, with as close to real as can be, perhaps too much so. but it does highten tension when youre all fighting together and if you make a mistake youre out. on the other hand the game itself sometimes feels clunky and the controls seem like they have purposly been made difficult. not that this is differnt from previous arma, it just continues to annoy me. any game that does not have e as use might as well not use wsad as directional keys. every action seems like hard work, almost like a battle, and while ive had fun with arma 3, it sometimes leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth, of time wasted. even with this, i struggle not to recommend it, its a good game, theres loads of game modes and if you can handle the control setup then youll certainly have some fun! plus its a step away from cod/battlefield, which sometimes can be a welcome change on its own.",1
"quite an amazing game. definitely one of the most realistic milsims out there that isnt marketed towards people that are actually in the military. (vbs2/3). definitely not everyones cup of tea, and community is pretty harsh on former cod fans, but once they realize that you hate cod youre welcomed. still, many tactical units out there, and some amazing community members that do amazing work.",2
"with all the different multiplayer modes and missions, plus custom made scenario missions from the workshop, this game never gets old. it is a great game for hardcore players. the game is gorgeous. especially at night. i paid full price for this game and never regretted it. if you see it on sale, it is a must have for military fps fans.",1
"not a fan of this game. i try to like it as much as i can, but the graphics and the sound are so off-putting that i usually just give up on it. maybe this time around with some friends i will finally be able to get into the game and enjoy it.",1
"arma 3 is a very fun game to play if you have some friends that will join your adventures. the campaign is awesome. the mods are awesome. but i mostly recommend playing epoch/overpoch mod",2
"such a good game. dont get it if you have a bad pc!",4
"now i can feel like im in the military doing military things or mine for coal in arma life",1
"ive played this game for hundreds of hours. its an amazing game. i have hopped onto this uk altis life server, where if you were to get ran over you would not die. so i ran up the street into kavala and noticed a truck was heading out of kavala. i ran into the street and screamed at the truck, the truck then lost control and flipped over and then blew up. i rate this 8/8 m8 would play again. ign 9000/5 stars.",5
"just... amazing. i see a lot of fun ahead. still a noob and it is just great. amazing community. found a great guy on a server and he spent over an hour just showing me how to play. why are you even reading this, just buy it.",1
"i very much enjoyed the game. with 50 mods installed the game alone is boring and empty",2
"pros: solid game lots of mods has the most playback value of almost any game. cons: lag and de-sync on multiplayer missions",4
"this game is amazing. i tell all my friends about and they ask what kind of game it is and i tell them, a combat simulator. you dont go in to this game with a mini gun and kill everyone with one shot. the damage is realistic. if you shoot someone with a pistol to the head they will die. i was playing on a role playing server trying to cause a ruckas and i shot someone to the upper chest area with an assault rifle and they died. this is the game to play! massive maps. role playing, team death match modes, capture the hill modes, coop missions, seperate zombie mods (breaking point). this game should be a pc gamers bible. always on their side and preach it to others.",1
"i dont even have the game yet....no clue why it gave me a reason to review it. anyway, the game looks ing awesome! cant wait to buy it...eventually.",1
"ground zero for the big boys here... where to start with arma 3 coming from the first installment of the franchise back in the late 90s operation flashpoint i remember playing through the demo over and over again with it being different every time i was blown away by the size and scope of the war simulator and coulnt wait to get my hands on it. playing arma, arma 2 and all dlc that followed and now to arma 3 in 2013. if you are a fan of simulators and anything that has to do with war arma 3 is for you. arma 3 is your playground to create any scenario you could dream of playing out any scene from a war movie you like you can do that in arma 3 and then some. arma 3 is a sandbox experience on a scale nothing else has come close too i really appreciate the introduction to underwater operations with diving etc. i have put in 73 hours into the alpha build playing coop missions with my crew and have had amazing runs from infiltrating a enemy camp to assassinate a officer with out being detected to running intense cqb ops with your buddys or doing helo runs on an enemy convoy arma 3 is a one stop shop for all your war sim needs.",3
"really really really complicated for beginner who never played a arma before.... lol just imagine that all your buttom on your keyboard have an action. the frendly ia is so stupid so when you are the commander its really hard",1
"the closest thing to a military simulator that i have found... and ive been in an actual government military simulator vr training ground before. also has one of the coolest communities ive ever met with lots of modding support. def. worth getting now at full price even if you missed out on early access and alpha.",1
"arma 3 in my opinion is the best one in the series, fun multiplayer, campaign, and all the mods. i certainly recommend this game to anyone",1
"a very fun modern war game! i also really like the mods for the gam.",1
"this game is amazing. no other game can compete. the amount of things you can do is outstanding from playing on a tatical server to just having fun with frends on a closed server. looks amazing, plays well and they keep on adding stuff! 10/10.",1
"desync is real, get swallowed by metal fences and brick walls and rocks resulting in death .......",5
"great game! can not begin to tell you how many fun times i have had. you should get it for sure. you will get many fun memories for the price you pay.",1
"a real step up from the previous game. a must have for combat simulation fanatics",1
"this game is much better than the trailer and pictures describe it to be. get it, its not just your average shooter, you can do so much more.",1
"solid game with plenty of mods and missions to complete! tries a little to hard to do everything",5
"this game, and all the previous ones, redefine shooter games. arma 3 creates the most realistic atmosphere i have ever seen in a game. the community makes it all the better as they play to be emersed in the gameplay, which in turn, emerses you into a world where the possibilities are utterly endless. at one point you can be headed to a drop zone in an orca (or whatever else you use) and the next be pinned down requesting support from the tank unit 2 km from your position.",2
"deffinetely the best game ive ever played. great to play with friends on wasteland mode. so much you can do",1
"it is a great game well the editor is anyway but the fact they didnt have missions from day one was annoying but still its great to see the missions now! but overall i think this is a great and fun game!! :)",1
"played around 50 hours of this game so far and its really fun. the main thing that got me hooked was altis life, still every other gamemode is just as engaging. highley recommended game if you have the required specs :)",1
"awesome game. you need a great system to run it, but the experience is a+. the fun is endless with the mods in the game.",2
"arma3 is not a simulator but close to a simulator.",5
"i think it is a bit over priced but it still is very fun. my favorate thing is the editor because you can spawn in anything you like and mess around with everything! altis life is a really cool mod for arma 3 aswell so you should try that out if you get arma 3.",1
"hello, very good game if into simulation and also it relates very well to real life, this game is very mod flexible and there have been alot of mod releases latley e.g. arma 3life milsin units and all of that sort of stuff that takes the modding cabablilties very far with this game",4
"iam starting to like this game,i will review this game again in a few weeks",1
"brilliant, fantastic gameplay, content and mod packs....a `must` buy.",2
"i love this game!!! its a very tactical, strategic and realistic shooter with tons of replay value.",1
"it is a cool game but i would play arma 2 oa instead.",1
"started playing altis life... > join a random server > get a quad > on the way to the peachfield > hear sirens from 2 police vehicles (5 heavy armed officers) > wtf.jpg > getting handcuffed > 15k ticket for speeding > unable to pay > spend 25 min. in jail 10/10",2
"i just got this game yesterday and have played 6 hours of it. this is so much fun",1
"great game! i always loved the arma series it begon with ofp first arma and the graphics of this game are stunning! but i dont like the future vehicles ect but its awsome with mods :d",2
"good game, little buggy at times, but overall good, has a good community that hosts servers alot of which are fun and full of gameplay, decent amount of vehicles.",2
"glorious arma master race game now looking even better. no way to explain it other than by saying it is the greatest game to yet release this year. oh wait wrong game. its not that good.",1
"so, this is my review on arma 3, now if your looking for a game with a weak canpaign involving real military tactics but slow gameplay, this is what you get, but, this game is all about the multiplayer and the mods, the mods are out of this world, the only real gamemode i play is battle royal, you bassically get chucked out of a heli onto an island you then have to find a a gun and other things to keep yourself alive, danger every where, random carpet bombings, carepackages, and the other playes, it is a free for all, theres only one surviver, the game does not end till there is only one person alive. overall this game is one of my all time favourite games and i 100% recommened picking this up specially as its on sale, 9/10.",1
"the experiences in this game, are unforgetable and only happen in this game. it can feel like a movie, except youre in it, and youre the main character. this game is a must buy, and i mean that when i say it. beware though, once you get it, theres no going back.",1
"a nice simulator. unlike other games that try to give a warfare experience but instead give you a stupid cqc stage, in this game, it is do or die, you must team up, but you can give it a try to being solo, of course, it will not be like call of duty or medal of honor, it will be... an unique close-to-real warfare experience. the game has few guns, but they are unique and can make a difference. the variants are extended, making it a huge library of choices you can have. the bullets have an unique rendering, and you can have tracers (red, green.), which can be seen and can help to tell a nearby teammate where the enemy is. the vehicles are decent, most are sluggish and it does not really give you a civillian feeling, but it gives out most of the military feeling. many servers to play in, with different modes: altis life, co-op, zeus and so on. you can find a game mode you want, and with the huge quantity of modifications existing around steam and the internet, you will certainly never stop playing, unless tactics or marksmanship isnt your thing. 9.5/10",1
"by far one of the best military games on the market. this has many improvements over a2, most importantly, many bugs were fixed and the game runs much better than a2 ever would have. something else id also like to point out is that the campaign in a3 is by far better than a2s and there is just so much to do. only thing id like to come down on a3 is the lack of vehicles, but im sure bohemia will come out with an a2: oa esque expansion soon enough and i am definetely looking forward to it.",3
"this game is one of the best games i played. was a huge fan of the battlefield series but after the battlefield 4 fail i bought arma 3. there has not been a single moment i regred it. there are enough servers/ gamemodes and there are so many ways you can play the game. there is no end at it you can make you own server and play some missions whit some friends. the players can be  some times and there are still alot of bugs in the game. but overall its a great game",5
"so many different games to play.. buy for a great time and endless nights of fun",1
"this is probably the first game that ive played that actually had people working together. joined a 40 player co-op server where everyone communicated with eachother and coordinated movements between squads. 10/10 would buy again",1
"i really like this game it is so fun the editor mode is really fun to play around with making your own scenerios or just having a massive war for the hell of it so to the creators i say arigato!",1
"my tank hit a bunny and exploded. anti tank bunnies- great game fully recommended. 1500/10",1
"commander mow head of lawn warfare: this is my lawn there are many others like it but this one is mine",1
"wow. just wow. best millitary simulator youve ever played. so realistic, teamwork, i dont know how to explain. buy the game, get in server, get in squad, and start killing. lets go! 111100000/10",1
"arma 3 is perplexing, actually. on the surface, i find i tend to sit around and do a whole lot of nothing when playing. standing around and driving from point a to point b is the norm. however, there is a certain quality that makes it terrifically addictive. i dont know what it is, but i enjoy the game thoroughly. there are plenty of exciting moments and when youre done with a match (that often takes hours to play) youre filled with a sense of accomplishment. i dont even need to mention the community around doing mods and such. it adds to the game immensely. 10/10 would play again.",3
"ever wondered how it feels to be a muscular, hard- operator? well too bad, youre a scrawny ing toy soldier with futuristic gadgets which does all the fighting for you so all you get to do is walk around in your undies while in base. i want a refund, this isnt what i payed for, even for an alpha. however, bis sure nailed that underwear buldge just right. 9/10 average rail-shooter.",2
"this game is awesome. ive clocked almost 30 hours and have not even made it through half of the things i want to do with this game. the possibilities are endless, and there is so much to do. the campaign is lengthy, it has an in built editor for creating you own missions, various weapons, vehicles, players, multiplayer, what else could you want. arma 3 has it all.",1
"this is a great game it combines a bit of the ace mod dayz loadout vibe and great graphics!",5
"if you love hardcore military simulations that require you to have octopus hands to play them, go ahead and buy this. no really, its great.",1
"it is usually fun but sometimes people are like way to srs on it and pretend it is irl amd that can be annoying.",1
"in altis life cops arest you for no reason 10/10 buy this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"its a great game, but its not for anyone. if you are not an enthusiast of this type of games, you might just leave the game and never play it. but if you like it, you will find great fun playing, expecially with friends.",4
"i didnt know what to write about in my review, so heres a recipe for pancakes instead: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon white sugar 1 1/4 cups milk 1 egg 3 tablespoons butter, melted 1. in a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth. 2. heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. brown on both sides and serve hot.",1
"great game i was at this one spot and someone shot me and then they revived me, i got a headshot and dey be ded",1
"while this game had some major bugs at the begining, it has started to smooth out to be one of the best simulators of all time. lets start out with the actual simulation. well you are defaulted to be in first person everytime you spawn but you can go to third person if you have the keys binded. there is bullet drop, weather, vehicles, weapons(not real time weapons), and lots of customization options for your soldier. there is tons of fatigues and weapons to choose from if youre playing vanilla. now if youre playing with mods in your game, you are going to have a even better time playing. mods can help with ai and add new clothes for your soldier, i.g helmets, vests, facial protection, and fatiuges. just a really big tip is if you dont have anyone to play with on this game, find a milsim unit and i guarentee you wont be bored. 10/10 would join milsim unit again thx bohemia interactive",2
"not only did i play single player modes and scenarios for countless hours, while only getting more excited about this game literly plays how you want it. if you want it to be the single handed most realistic military sim it will be that for you. if you wanna get creative and have a hellish zombie horde goin down it will achieve your satisfaction... and then you finaly play online and meet some cool dudes who wanna role play this mil sim, and you play your first scenario lets say a sniper recon mission for 5 hours callin out cordinates and speaking mil chatter through your mic you will find out that playing games for hundreds of hours does in fact not get old but yet more tastful.",2
"there is alot of talk about how the souls games are some of the hardest games one can currently play. that is glossing over arma, these games are hard. overcoming thet challenges in any arma game are the most rewarding expeience i have had in gaming. this game is not for everybody but if you want to see a large battle unfold around you, or create that battle in the mission editoy arma 3 is a great platform for that. oh and on a quick aside this game has a incredible lighting engine, the dark of night time without night vision is amazing.",1
"great game, this is the real war simulator, very very hard game but is really awesome!! if youre ready to spend hours to finish a mission and study a tactical way to do it, this is your game. with friends is really a great fun!!",2
"if you loved socom, soccom ii, and even socom ii, but still wanted it to be more hardcore, then this is the game for you. ai is still a little clunky as of feb 2014, but we are still in beta. the game is huge! just like its predecessors this game is larger than most training areas in the continental us. and it is also huge in the number of weapons and vehicles that are playable. not necessarily for the battlefield/cod crowd. although you can change/edit settings to make the game that way, in general it is much more methodical. my major complaint is that when i put 2 infantry squads under the control of a lieutenant, the formations became very funky. instead of 1 squad on each side, the two squad leader fireteams were on one side, and the two team leader fireteams were on the other. but again, game is still in beta. there is probalb pluses = immersion, graphics, realism, scope, community minuses = squad control ui, issues with platoon-size units under 1 group leader time to get started on that foxhunt mission....",3
"best military simulation know for the consumer market to date 9/10.",2
"one of the best games ive ever played 10/8 gg ez game",2
"so much fun. the multiplayer is so submersive, and the campaign is realistic as heck and not short either. if you love realism in shooters, then this game is for you",1
"i love this game, mods make it way more fun but with out mods its still a very good game",1
"a good addition to this game would be terrain destruction. imagine shooting down a jet, and watching it plow through the ground, leaving a giant mark on the terrain. also being able to shoot down walls, destroy doors, or use thermo-barrac explosives to burn a house with hostiles inside. seems like a worth-while addition.",1
"and downloading missions. arma 3 is overpriced though...",2
"mixed emotions about this one... bought it when it was 40 bucks, kinda wish i didnt. only real good parts about this are customizing levels of your own. custom koth servers are good too. other than that, i didnt really enjoy this. i was hoping a lot more from arma 3. arma 2 still has unlimited gameplay in it. rp servers, and normal servers. if you want a good war sim, this is pretty good. if you want a semigood war sim with basically unlimited gameplay, arma 2. i dont exactly recommend this game, but its pretty okay. 6.4/10",1
"watched some streams and videos about altis life so even with the high price decided it looked fun. umm, yeah, the arma ui is all kinds of wonky. switched to single player campaign to learn it a bit better and it was pretty meh out the gate. lot of money for something that is everywhere for cheaper. probablly be alot more fun for me if i had a group or some like minded people to play with. /edit i still stand by the wonky controls but i have grown fond of some of the mods. king of the hill and some others are quite fun. i cant say i am that good at them but i have gotten better the more i play. for the money it still seems overpriced, but some good gameplay is to be had at times.",2
"was tasked with roadblock duty, then within the span of five minutes it esclated from mundane tasks of the average grunt to joseph mangela levels of war atrocities. i rate it 44/44 slaughtered civilians. some major bravo sierra.",1
"arma 3 is a really good game. if you love arma 2 strategic and realistic fpses, this is the game for you. but if you dont like strategic , and you rather play cod than arma 2, etc. you rather not buy this game. you like it, or not. arma 3 is really fun if you play multiplayer with your friends, or make a tunngle lan match and play co-op missions or sandbox. some buildings will break if you explode them with an rpg, like the tower in the stratis air base, try it for yourself if you have it!",2
"compared to arma 2 this game is no where near as good as arma 2 was. pros: goodish graphics better voice acting more enterable buildings slightly more realistic sounds cons: terrible fps on a good pc hardly any weapons hardly any air vehicles altislife is crap so save your money",1
"best military sandbox, most fustrating fps i ever played.",1
"my mic does not work in arma 3. i have tried everything out of everything with no results at all, plz help. my mic works in skype, voice recs, and other games like gmod. but it dosent work in arma 3. there is nothing wrong with my mic. there is only something wrong with arma 3 that dosent transmit my voice at all. plz add me on steam and help me im very desperete. and frustrated. and by the way sry for my bad english",2
"there are many custom game modes such as: atlas life, wasteland, breaking point, and many more. i have had a great time while i played it on the free weekend, and will be buying it before the final sale ends. 1337/10 would weed again.",1
"dont buy it its broken and unfinished you will not be able to play anything but the first episode up until the tipping point mission where you will not be able to board the boat and complete the mission this is a fraudulantly represented game bi refuses to answer to this since 2013 do not buy",2
"this game makes u feel like its the real deal this is a great game",3
"amazingly fun, endless possibilities in this game.",1
"played game for 150 hours. stopped playing for 2 weeks. relaunched game, joined server, walked 2 meters and global ban. 1/10 would not walk again.",1
"if you like arma 2 you need to see the improvements they did on 3",3
"bought it, played it, ran it at 10 fps, still loved it.",1
"good game, still a little lacking with features, (like jets and a medical/wounding system like in arma 2, ) but overall a good game, the editor is awesome for making your own battles/missions, multiplayer is fun too.",1
"got shot. dead. load save. got shot. dead. load save. rinse and repease. 11/10 would recommend",1
"best military simulation game ever made, since ghost recon",2
"epic game such good fun especially if you have played previous arma games",1
"driving the helicopters is like getting molested by old men. its rough, it hurts and its moist.",1
"one of the best games i have ever p[ayed i love this game",1
"probably one of the best military sims out there right now, amazing graphics, great engine, smooth gameplay, and tons of mods.",1
"this game is great i love it. its cool how you can port jsut about everything form arma 2 to arma 3 and how bis put were you could change your outfit. a must have!!!!!!!! and the modding coummity is over the top with mods",3
"it is a improvement on arma 2 ... mods are cool too!",1
"this game is fantastic if you enjoy games that require you to work as a team to complete objectives. grab some friends jump on a server and let the team building begin. prefer to go solo? well the campaign is absolutley spectacular. still not interested? you can always play with the mods that are always coming out and being updated. in short there is something for everyone.",1
"best game ive ever played , good graphics , no bugs , reallife simulator #bestgame2014",3
"this was my first military simulator and i loved it. pros -graphics -quality of the simulation -variety of game modes cons -takes long to get used to it -a bit too addictive :d i would reccomend arma 3 to anyone but if you are feeling not so sure about getting this game get it in the steam sales like i did for 17 pounds :)",3
"if like simulation military ganes this one is for you you can fly a jet thru a wall and not die you can also get shot by a rocket dierectly in the chest and not die best sim game ever",2
"verdict: good reasons: on its own the game is a small disapointment from what we would come to expect from bohemia. stating this i would like to mention that the game is not even close to being a bad game the standards where just set very high. the game allows tons of mods about all kinds of things. this game is nothing near cod so you cod fanboys that do nothing else than cod please dont ruin this game for others. overall the anti hack system is prety good. this game requires a lot of team work so dont even think about being a stingy player it wouldnt benifit you. im not the best in reviews but i hope this helped someone",4
"fantastic game!!! it really does need some patches, more weapons and animation fixes (especially with reloading). but other than that, if you love extremely hardcore games (and only hardcore games, this game will be bad if your going to play it like cod or bf), then this is the game for you. considering the state that its in, id give it an 8.5/10 . but when the devs fix the glitches and animations, this game will easily score at least a 9.5/10 for a military simulation. it has a very steep learning curve, but in 5 hours or so you should get the hang of it :d",1
"waay better than call of duty its awsome. if you love open world milatary games that are realistic buy this game now",3
"played the first two missions; super real and crazy fun, it definitely caught me off guard. gameplay time: 2 hrs. played altis life online; got hacked and nuked, wonder if i still have the 24m he gave me. gameplay time: 42 mins.",1
"recommended but sometimes friendly ai are stupid and enemy ai utilize core i5 very well to take me down ============================================================================= ok that one doesnt have a good impression of the game so heres a new one, based on actual gameplay --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i heard an explosion. it was apers (anti-personnel) mine. teammate stepped on it? no one died. then? timed explosion? no. remote detonation? no. enemy stepped on it? theyre not that dumb. on a closer inspection, it was a chicken. a chicken bravely stepped on a mine to help our cause. 10/10 for unrelated npcs to take part in the war. at its own will.",1
"arma 3 is a great roleplaying game with amazing game mechanics and strategetic systems. there are many servers to choose from, but sometimes the community is not so friendly which creates the need for survival. the game is unique and is definately worth its price!",1
"awesome sandbox military simulator, with mods like breaking point and wasteland, this game will bring heaps of fun in a openworld island scenario, highly recommended.",1
"really realistic, if youre looking for an indepth immursive military simulator, or you just want army vehicles to blow up, this is your game.",2
"from what ive played, this game is not work the $40 on the sale, let alone ing $60. you need a maxed out pc to play this game at 55-60 fps constantly. i have a gtx 670 (2gb vram), 16gb of installed ram, and 3.40 ghz quad core i5, and i have to run this game on low-normal settings just to get 30 fps on modes such as king of the hill (where more players are present, but i still get low fps on the wasteland mod). youre better off buying the arma 2 bundel with operation arrowhead and finding a steam group that has events for this sort of stuff, or a wasteland arma 2 server all together. arma 3 does not live up to my low-set expectations.",1
"lag in server & play alone in mission is no lag no delay.",1
"only to angry people that are pashent not x call of duty players because that s^*(ts fake arma 3 is the defnation simulator game!",2
"best military simulation on the market, not perfect, but very good.",3
"there is nothing that i dont like about this game.",2
"i have just bought the game installed it opened the game and was global banned for no reason terribal game",1
"buggy as hell, dlc is basically updates that should have been included in the game for free ? what the hell bohemia, i was excited for arma 3 to be released as i thoroughly enjoyed arma 2 oa when arma 3 was relelase i was very disapointed i dont think ill be buying another bohemia game due to the amount you ed your customers around.",4
"arma 3 is a great military simulator, you wont get the fast paced shooter feel that you get with bf4 or cod but instead get a slower paced but more rewarding (imo) experience. the non-combat roles such as logistics and support add an entirely different angle to what you get in other shooters. however it is a game you need to either play with a large group of like minded people or find something on the workshop that you like. i found the campaign had a decent storyline but wasnt particularily fun to play. however, some of the games ive had online have been simply amazing and to me thats what you should buy the game for. pros- highly realistic amazing visuals friendly community excellent mods available cons- not a great singleplayer game some missions take a while to get to any reasonable gameplay 7/10",2
"pros: -lots of vehicles -very very realistic -downloadable senarios -lots of controls (theres one to even salute and sit down) -a variety of weapons, it just so happens that 95% of the time i have a scar of some sort cons: -ai is terrible and dumb and slow! -shooting someone makes them to some kind of limbo back bending motion, looks really weird (whats up with that) -takes forever to get in the action on multiplayer co-op modes and i mean forever (really frustrating when you finially get on the ground then die or have a dumb pilot that crashes) -cant walk and switch weapons, like really? overall 50/50 but im going to recommend it beacuse a lot of people like it a lot more than i do so maybe youre one of those people",1
"many fun and amazing mods. i especially love battle royale, which is essentially an intense gaming version of the hunger games. 10/10.",1
"gameplay is perfect, the idea is perfect. but expect low fps ( even on high end pcs ) some times my gpu load drops below 20% this happens on low to ultra settings. my friends have the same problem. it happens in the city;s. not in the open. looks like this game cant be fixed cause the problem ik the engine were the game is build on. the only fix is a entire new engine. like they are going to do with dayz standalone. i get 75 fps average but drops which are like in the 20s if you can live with fps drops to 25 buy it. the gameplay is the best part of arma 3. the sound is below average. not the quality but direction of the sound is coming from",1
"holy, what can i say? bohemia you did it again, there is never a dull moment with this game, one moment i was walking through a forest with my men, being stealthy (i took my pants off to be super sneaky) and one guy set off a mine, killed 2 of my men, we had to fight a whole squad of the enemys my heart was racing. think you have had enough of this game? your wrong, there is tons of modders out there creating mods for our entertainment, from zombie killing to diving contests, there is a mod for you. dont feel like playing a mod? go to the steam workshop and find a mission that others made, for you to play!!! all in all 12/10",1
"outstanding game, with open environment and wide option of completing the mission.",1
"buy it if you know you have a good pc. if you dont have a good pc buy csgo skins or dota2 items.",1
"ing rip off its says you need 4gb ram and i have that and when i play this game online i get ing worst fps ever dont buy",1
"comparable to minecraft in its diversity and modability while maintaining a smooth and beautiful mechanic and graphic theme. endless options for modding but also includes a campaign and scenarios for people uninterested in mods. once youve played arma 3, all first person shooters seem to be lacking depth. i highly recommend this game.",4
"a lot less clunky than arma 2, infact arma 3s stance adjust control system should become standard. ive so far found the single player campaign a bit lacklustre, feels overly linear for such a non linear open world map. that said, playing the mod pilgrimage is much much more addictive and shows what this game is capable of. cant comment on multiplayer yet as i wanted to learn the control system (and finish pilgrimage) first but its safe to say thats where the real meat of this game is.",1
"i have to say, this game is dam realistic :), and perfect! even without that mod called dayz",3
"amazing game, amazing graphics, amazing price i am totaly recommending this game!",1
"i mostly play wasteland and king of the hill, but with its mod support and range of in-game fidelity, im surely to play this game for a very long time.",2
"i have the game downloaded, everything is updated, steam is being run as admin, directx up to date, c++ up to date but when i open the game in steam and press play it loads for a half second then does nothing.... this is getting slightly irritating because i have my arma 3 life application filled out but i cant get my arma 3 uid off of the game cause i cant run it. even when i run the desktop shortcut nothing happens. the launcher opens but other than that its not working for me. please help anyone. im getting upset.",3
"while the ai can be a flaw, there are mods that fix that, and i greatly enjoy this game overall, its one of the best games ive ever played. 15/10 :3",1
"great game when it will actually be ready for release.",1
"i have brought every single arma game and never actually played the games themselves. but the mods are worth the buy alone so 10/10",1
"game is awesome! takes a while to get used to, but definitly worth it!!",1
"looted the corpse of my fallen comrade and took his sunglasses. 10/10 respec for your fallen bredas.",1
"the best thing about the game is the ai, its absolutely magnificent, ive never seen so many guys have an orgy on one wall 10/10",1
"slow,laggy,choppy not such a good game. you gotta have a good computer",1
"i do recommend. what is needed for the game is fair enough of a free time. especially have on mind, that setting up a good multiplayer experience is a matter of many hours. animation were greatly improved and ai as well. only negativum for me is not using all the game very promising mechanic in the sp part of the game and very weird ending (all options) which was done under a rush i believe. if youve grown up on flashpoint, this is a must have",1
"best game ive ever played , good graphics , no bugs , reallife simulator #bestgame2014",3
"i love this game so much. but you really need to enjoy these types of games in order to keep playing this title from behemia interactive. this game has its ups and downs, first ill start with the cons .... you need a beefy computer to run it. this game is really taxing for your pc even though on max settings it doesnt look that amazing. its only because of its huge map and sandbox gametype. this game also has a few bugs that you can ignore because it doesnt affect your gameplay. but this game is fun as hell. delviering realistic gameplay like you are truely in the army fighting, i suggest putting on headphones and maxing out the effects sound option so those gunshots are loud! this game gets really intense, because you know even one bullet could end you... overall i suggest you buy this game but maybe when its on sale. if this game sounds amazing to you, then buy it now. 8.5/10",1
"very much worth the money, however you need a power computer to run it acceptably.",1
"a really great and realistic game but do not buy this game if you are not patient because you will have to wait alot of time for a enemy to shoot or to get a chopper, car etc. sometimes.",2
"not as good as arma ii, but it has a lot of improvements (more graphics options! better inventory system! improved voice acting!) but also a lot of issues (drop down menu is more confusing! mouse issues! worse optimization!) however, anybody whos put in a good amount of time into the previous games will probably like this one. i just wouldnt recommend it to newcomers.",1
"this game and its community are possibly the biggest cancer in the gaming universe. what is seen on one screen isnt the same as what is on another. you are staning inside and your derp is outside to the other players. bi has a very long way to go with this and their other cancerous titles. if you want to frustrate yourself to no end, pull out most if not all of your hair and feel like stabbing a group of babies multiple times after every play, please feel free to pick this game up. oh and the people you play with are a team killing batch of trolls who couldnt finght their way out of a wet paper bag if they tried.",3
"there aint any horses in this motha a.  you and this game",1
"arma iii has outstanding visuals and a intense set of game play mechanics. this game is not for the average fps player, its for players who want more from the average fps shooter. all in all it takes awhile to get into but once you find a good community to play with you have a  ton of fun!",1
"great military simulator and an amazing followup to arma 2 8/10",1
"arma 3 is a huge step-up from arma 2. it features vastly improved graphics. new futuristic weaponry, vehicles and more. i would reccomend this game for everyone!",3
"amazing game from bohemia, not suprised in the slightest in how detailed and immersive this game is",1
"great game i cant wait to bay it i playd it only when it wos free for a weekend and i had so mush fun. i recommend this game to everbody!",1
"great game definatley the best game of the year for pc its a must buy",2
"where are the crosshairs on this game? if there are any i must be getting unlucky and picking all the servers without them. i mean yeah ok graphics, but bad animation details, doesnt really feel like a shooter when you cant aim down the barrel of your gun, or even see your gun sometimes. the controls for this game are ridiculous, theres no need for all those controls, games not hard they just spent alot of their time putting useless stuff in it.",1
"campaign/gameplay is insanely realistic and can lead to utter addiction. i only recommend you buy this if you got nothing but hours and hours to spend in the online communities and mods playing until you can not see any more.",3
"overall, this game is not an enjoyable experience due to several key factors: the foremost being the enemy ai which are unbearably difficult to fight. a lot of the time it seems the game will put nerfed teammates with you againsed enemy ai that are impossible to fight againsed with the weapons and equipment provided. the game will often put you in positions where you are on your own againsed impossible odds -- not in the fun, challenging way either. more in the way that youre laying in a field by yourself, being bombed, while having to take down several enemies at long range with unsilenced weapons with no cover (keep in mind that these ai spot you the second you fire a weapon and will 1-shot you instantly.). the only reason you should purchase this game is for the mods and multiplayer. this games optimization is absolutely terrible, so unless you have a really bulked up gaming pc, do not buy this",1
"for just $15.99, you can now get the helicopters dlc, which includes, for that one low price, just two helicopters ! ! in addition to this awesome deal, you get to shoot from vehicles, which should have been in the game in the first place ! order now and well double your offer. **just pay separately for core game mechanics.",3
"this game has a distracting dialouge, and with your guns it is impossible to aim and there are so many game-breaking glitches. in the first five minutes i walked infront of one of the npcs on the road and then he got stuck and i had to restart the entire game. i was playing it when it was free for a week but i highly do not reccomend that you buy this game at sixty dollars. there are many better things that you could spend that on. overall you should not buy this game.",1
"this game is the most amazing, frustrating, and addicting game that i think ive ever played. im really not even crazy about fps. the thing is, this can hardly even be called a fps. i am new to the arma series, and havent owned arma 3 for more than 2 weeks at the time of this review. what made me want to even write a review is the fact that this game is so damn hard, and realism is such a priority, that when you succeed the feeling of accomplishment is completely real. when you get in a serious fire fight you will feel hints of addrenaline. if youre not afraid of hardcore, unforgiving, ultra realistic combat, then do not pass this up!!!",1
"while some may disagree, this game i find it a whole lot better, the physics of the bodys and the whole interface is quite realistic as to were in arma 2 they all had the all hail death animation, and while being a little glitchy. the game is super optimized, so if you run arma 2 on medium or high, expect to run this on ultra with very similar preformance (disable some of the anti-filtering). this i would give a 9/10 its a great game and will be sure to waste some hours of my life in this game, all in all buy...it...just look at the graphics and tell me this game dosent look sexxayyy!",3
"this game is amazing. the graphics are stunning and the gameplay is just great. finally i get to play a massive war game. 10/10 1 word: amazing",1
"i only really play over/e poch, and from my experience its a great game. you have moments when helis blow up for no reason, or you die to stairs but when you look past that, the skys the limit, to building bases, collecting weapons, starting firefights with your neighbours, or making peace treatys. this game is great.",1
"being a big fan of operation flashpoint from way back when, this game is a great replacement for it. if you are tired for the arcade style, casual, fast paced and no skill requirment of modern games. (ie: cod and bf) and want something that requires, skill, timing, know how and realism. then this is the game for you. must like op:flashpoint, it isnt for the faint of heart at start. lots of keys, lots of actions you need to know. but with like anything else, put the time into it and you can do it. huge steam workshop community, lots of add ons which means more free content. dont like something? make it yourself. this game is great fun, though it may not be for all, its great for most. think of it as the eve online for shooters. nothing beats playing mp and being a good transport pilot to get your troops to and from battle or respawns. you can actually make a difference.",1
"arma 3 is a good composed game. i couldnt stop playing since it merges you into a intense war atmosphere. it was cool getting into a car with a bunch of people and riding to kill an enemy group on altis life rpg (one of the many cool gamemodes). some things that you will need to get used to is walking and not seeing action for a while (which make those fights 10 times better). but if you want a zombie survival type of gamemode do epoch (which is pretty fun). also another gamemode is sandbox, which you go into a world with a bunch of people and test and monkeying around with the vechiles and guns (helps you get used to the gun physics). arma 3 is a good for 59.99$ when it includes 4 different gamemodes. also would like to state this game wont be like any other shooter you will ever play hope you think my review was helpful. (warning the game will crash your pc if you dont have the requirements)",1
"i started the game up and when i got onto the main menu, i crashed. 10/10 goty",1
"by far my favorite game!! very cpu intensive though.",2
"game had great introduction and i had fun. i dont know what it says about a war game when the most enjoyable part was the driving bits though... there was also quite lot of lag and frame rate kept jumping. i also had problems with achievements so that they did not come up when i got them, they came hours late or not at all. game had problems but i still recommend it because it was fun.",1
"arma 3 is an amazing game if you play solo, but it truly comes to life when you play it with your friends. definitely reccomended.",1
"great game, great graphical infrastructure and great team play. this game has it all. with modding available in the workshop, you can create your own war. if your a fps fanattic, this is the war game for you! online is just as fun :)",1
"pros: -sick graphics -sick physics -sick control capabilities -awesome dialogue between npcs and player -alot of realism in the camp setups and mission stories -multiplayer is alot of fun if you have 20+ friends cons: -enemies that can magically see you in full camo while u prone behind bushes at 3-400 meters distance with no zoomed sights or binoculars -appearance of a difficult campaign based on designed circumstances requiring you to corpse run your way through it or be chuck norris and one man army groups of 30 enemies at a time at 300 meters with nothing but an unsighted crap rifle and no ammo -fatigue system that forces you to walk slowly and stop to rest while your npc partners can sprint 1000 meters in front of you and get killed, leaving you to once again chuck norris your way through missions. -over 100 silly keybinds that are not even good as far as default keybinds go and will require at least an hour configuring them so you can use about 20 of them. (changing from a laptop to a desktop requires you to reconfigure all of them again) -multiplayer requires 20+ friends i recommend this game if you want to hate a game while spending hours afk in a bush because despite what the story requires your character is not chuck norris and you cant do anything.",1
"this game is awesome from the start , whos not to love a game where any mod works with it? from straight up war down to roleplaying 10/10",2
"great game found it hard to get into at first found it a bit of a tricky learning curve. since the bootcamp missions was added found it alot more easy to get into the game and im currently enjoying it.",1
"kill . get moaned at. get banned. cri evritim. play again. repeat. 10/10",1
"since modern warfare 2 this is the best game i have played. although i liked the call of duty francise, it has lost its way and has become a game of mindless running around chasing xp points. arma is huge, fun and needs more care to complete your objectives. although it lacks instant multiplayer gaming, there are only a few games to play, you can create your own or download one from steam, all free of charge. it took a lot of getting used to but i love it.",4
"ive had this game for some time now and i have to say...its amazing...there are tons of little things you could complain about but the over all picture is perfect....ive mostly been playing wasteland so i dont have much to say about the singleplayer and what not...",1
"ultra realistic combat sim. new update really improves performance",1
"i tried to love arma 2, but i rarely ever felt like i was having fun. everything just seemed like such hard work. on this basis i didnt buy arma 3. a mate got it for me as a gift about a month ago. i have been playing it almost non-stop ever since. the graphics are better, the game play is better. its still far from the perfect game, but everything that was in the arma 2 package is here but better. for me this game is about the total being greater than the sum of its parts. this game is still hard, with sometimes sluggish controls, and basic graphics, but when viewed in context of the true scale and depth of what they have acheived is it quite amazing. it still feels like there is more for the series to acheive, but based on this improvement curve arma 5 will come with a free box of kleenex. the gameplay is certainly not for everyone. dont think war game, think sandbox battle simulator. if you are unsure about making the committment i would suggest buying arma 2 for a song and giving it a try. although not as good, the gameplay still gives a taste of what you can expect from the all round better arma 3.",2
"-logged in -went into an arma 3 altis wasteland server -spawned in as blufor -realized that i was in the middle of nowhere, with no cars, or helicopters, and the nearest town or mission was about 50 km away -began running towards the mission -when i arrived there, the mission was over -no one was there -began running to the town -when i arrived to the edge of the town, i got sniped from 2 km away 10/10 would play walking simulator again.",1
"awesome game! improved graphic from arma ii. i like this game so much!",1
"just like any other new release, it has some bugs, but they are being worked out. its a great game as far as im concerned. and as time goes on and devs tweak it as needed, along with the cool mods, this is my primary game to play of all time.",3
"it is fun with altis life and wasteland but mods are too complicated to install in arma file please make custom game mods like overpoch epoch,battle royale into a simple mod menu not having to install alot of files",1
"this is a great game and well worth the money spent. however, since ive been playing from the begining of the alpha, its not quite as fresh as id like. good on its own, but far better with friends, a dedicated server, and some decent co-op missions. the dlc is not worth mentioning, unfortunately.",4
"awesome sandbox military sim. veterans will appreciate the realism.",1
"ultamate badasery if you know your millitary tactics and love simulation at the most harcore it can get on a expansive open world island this is the game for you",1
"i know i love this game but the engine it runs on is great it was voted the best milatary simulater game and the moded couminty is also great",4
"none of your friends have played this game recently. tell them why they should. they shouldnt.",2
"a truly visionary game. i would love to see other people put this much effort into a game.",1
"ill change this review if they ever fix the game breaking issues they have right now. if you just want to play single player then you should be fine. if you want to play with friends and actually experience arma with friends then you might as well just walk away now. you have a 50/50 shot at mp actually working for you without the client crashing. no work around, no support. just wait and see if they ever actually finish the damn game.",1
"i want to recommend, and enjoy, this game, but i dont. because it is very buggy and feels poorly scripted. sometimes something as fundamental as interacting with the world, car doors, ammo crates etc. can be really awkward. this can abruptly lead to your untimely, poorly justified, demise. or if youre really unlucky youll lay around unconcious for 5 minutes prior to dying! :) i cant forgive the devs or the bugs in this game like a lot of people can. it has been this way since arma 1 - which i never played but understood it was unplayable. arma 2 which i did play and found unplayable. after two games, i find arma 3 to be barely playable. i figure by now they ought to know what they are doing and how to achieve a desired result. niche game. im sure theres a reason so many people love it. i honestly feel as though im not patient enough to both play a simulator game, and babysit the flaws of said game in order to get something out of it. i havent exactly got a hardon for military games like others do either so bare in mind that your phallus may differ. i would definitely change my review to recommend and play this game if it were just.. less buggy, more playable.. it really doesnt matter if you add gokarts or dragons at this point, just improve the game.",1
"i do really recomend the game but the game is meant to be $50. i was looking at the arma website and converted it to usd and it said it was around $50. so would i say its a ripoff... no but i do think that steam should lower the amount. this game is worth it but steam just needs to look at that because i was playing the free weekend and it should have been like $25 dollars. i at that time had $20 so maybe we should ask steam to make a free full edition weekend where you could download it and keep it after the weekend finished...",1
"this is a great game hours of fun i played the altis life mod great will recommended to anyone",2
"cant go invert on xbox controller fix it please i cant play otherwise",1
"whilst still not as refined as its predecessor arma 3 offers a host of improvements in its engine and graphics. the community is growing and you can expect to find a vast array of experiences from the many game-modes on offer: cti (capture the island) koth (king of the hill) life roleplaying battle royale team deathmatch zeus coop patrol ops coop invade and annex coop to really appreciate this game find a good group of people to play with and itll probably become the best gaming investment you ever made!",3
"badly optimized game. its insane that you cant get 60fps on even the lowest settings during multiplayer. it will make you motion sick.",1
"if you like milsim games then this is the game for you.",2
"its fun but there is a problem with bad fps unless you have a super computer",1
"the new update ruined helicopters. total . not sure what kind of  would think the new controls are better.",3
"after the first update of 2015 my arma 3 had to be reinstalled and when i reinstall it it uninstalls itself and i have to install it again.",2
"i recommend this game to all modern day shooters and arma lovers.",1
"the problem with this game is that its not in your library yet",3
"i can write a reveiw after playing this game for 5 minutes when it was free? awesome 10/free",1
"great game. it starts of boring at first (well for me as i havent played arma 1 or 2) but then you get used to it and you start meeting people and coming up with tactical plans to take out an enemy base. you begin to build your own squad with your friends. there are differet game modes such as altis life where you can choose to be a cop, rebel or a civillian. you can then start a gang with your friends and start making drugs (create your own empire like heisenburg). you can basically do anything. arma 3 is such an amazing game and you will have problems with it at first but you will grasp it. you will always find something new to do with your friends. all in all i would give this game 10/10. great tactical play with realism and really throws you into the action. this is nothing like the  call of duty franchise or any other shooter this is unique.",1
"very fun to play, but can be very annoying as well. however, i would still recomend this game if it went on sale.",1
"arma never fails to impress, and arma 3 is no exception. the game looks beautiful and i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy and team work with their shooters.",1
"great game for someone who likes realistic strategy fps games.",1
"the most realistic army simulator/game of all time screw cod",1
"cant say enough good things about this game, especially in co-op mode. makes the call of duty series, and even the battlefield series, feel like arcade games. the realism it achieves elevates it above all others as a true combat simulator.",2
"if you liked arma 2 you will like this game. if you havnt played an arma game, i would definatly recomend watching a few videos to see what its like. personally i would give it a 9/10.",1
"no more falling and breaking legs? 11/10 game of the year",2
"what to say about this? erhmahgerd its finally here!!!!!!1!!! ive been waiting for this a while; it was worth said wait. the game is majestically optimised, gameplay is very fluid - more so than arma 2 - and you can get some brilliant moments in this. and this is a ing alpha. nice job, bi, cant wait for beta/official release.",1
"had very fun moments in rpg servers, especially altis life",1
"altis life, wasteland, king of the hill, co op missions and much more for arma 3. best game played so far.",2

"this game is nice, i like vac, i like vac bans. i  yo sister in bed, she number 1 prostitue in kazakhstan!",1
"amazing and very realistic game, with plenty of mods and a very active online community",2
"what has made this series so popular is the ability to mod it. the game by itself (talking about arma 2 and arma oa) are terrible games, but i have 100s of hours playing the modded versions of them, particularly the ace mod. since ace is not out for arma 3, and no sign of when it may come out, i cannot in good conscious recommend this game to anyone. the arsenal available in vanilla arma 3 is miniscule, and they have recycled a lot of graphical stuff from arma 2, making this worthy of the $20 shelf, not the current $60 price point. in summary, with ace out i would pay $60 for arma 3 today. without ace, only 2 maps, 2/3 of a campaign out, and no real game improvements coming from bohemian i would wait until this game gets to $19.99. update 22 july 2014. i can finally recommend this game again, since there are enough mods out there to once again make this game great. bi makes a poor game, the modding community makes it into a great game. while ace is still not out, there are other mods coming forward such as agm that make this game great. the weapon sway is completely broken without mods. as of this writing it is still $60, which is more than i would pay. pick this up on a steam sale for $30 or less.",2
"splendid idealogy but could use some, how can i say, advancement, the combat doesnt feel so perfect as in cs:go but it does compete with insurgency. eh id rate is 8/10 recommended if you got friends to play with, 6.5/10 without friends.",1
"10/10 stars if you can look around the small issues they are still having with the servers this game is on the top of my list to play, with or with out friends. if you like intence cqb style combat this games for you, if you like slow pase combat, if you like flying jets or helicopters, or if taking controil of a tank plt/convo this game is for you. the story is full of life and altho its a steep learning to this game its worth every hour you put in to it trainning with your friends, on even alone take it from me. by: travis borges > i approve this message",3

"all i have to say is....keep optimizing best game ever",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. if you looking for something more than some bf4 this is the game. i highly recommend this to anyone.",1
"would be nice if there wans a free weekend every 2 weeks otherewise it would be cool",1
"ya its a great game if you enjoy using the editor. new features with the ability to change stances is very cool. graphics are much improved from arma ii, but this game is not playable on multiplayer. some might say you must have a high spec processor and graphics card, but then why can i play single player with 60 fps on ultra.(i have fx-4170 4.2ghz cpu, r9-270 gpu) multiplayer matches have only the ability to deliver 20 fps which is just unplayable. then people say you must find a good server, but nearly every server is this way, unless i play a small 4 man coop mission which isnt even the selling point of this game. i thought this game was meant to be played on huge multiplayer missions on huge maps but it hasnt gone that way and hasnt been that way since the alpha.",1
"one of the best walking simulators on the market. challenges even day z",1

"i got arma 3 digital deluxe edition and i dont know how to add the dlc. also for my review its a great game will play no-stop if my mom doesnt tell me to stop playing",1
"huge maps, great gunplay (unlike armas of old) and a great modding community. this game started out fantastic and will only get better with more mods and game modes. if it pops up in a steam sale do not hesitate. buy it.",1
"amazing military simulation, this game is in my top 5. if you are looking for a game that has alot of replayability and a ton of game modes, you are looking at it. this game also has alot of different mods ranging from search and rescue to life mods.",1
"arma is a great game. there is so many game modes it is like 20 games in one. king of the hill sort reminds me of battlefiled and altis life is obviously gta. it also has a great well made missions. i got this game from watching videos on wasteland and already played wasteland in arma 2 i thought i must have this game. you love the way you look... i guarantee it",2
"i crashed a helicopter and made a grown man cry because we all died and lost the mission. 20/10",1
"the downside to this game, only one, you gotta play a lot, to get very good at it. is that a downside?",2

"incredible game made by currently unpresidented developers, supporting probably the best online community ever. there isnt enough superlatives to describe the astoshining feat made by releasing this sandbox, at least not without sounding like a rant. frankly, take any favorite fps or military game. then add sandbox, quality, free dlcs and continuos improvements, scripting possibilties, all vehicles and weapons and maps readily avaiable from the first try, no need to rank up and no need to pay to win. i could go on much further, but the best source for factual information is of course [dslyecxi] his youtube channel:",1
"for noobs (like me) really hard to play if you are just starting hard to find good servers with not whitelist. a new player will have trouble figuring out the controles. not sure if i wanna buy it or not yet.",1
"very complex but once you past that great slowed down fps",1
"soo... i buy the beta at 59.99 but the game is now 35.99... i dont get this...",2
"children play call of duty boys play battlefield men play arma",1
"this games is hours of fun. you can do simple missions all the way to complex missions or create your own. the game has a steam workshop to create and share missions with other people.",1
"if you played arma 2 and loved it there is a solid chance you will love arma 3. they are two games that have so much in common but arma 3 offers new and unique features all at the same time.",1
"be advised: +extreme realism +complex squad play +awesome engine +mods (altis life, epoch etc.) -extreme realism -ai squad leaders are  -little content inside. requires third-party content to remain interesting. -does anyone actually play the game itself? you will never get closer to an actual war/10",1
"this game is great for people wanting to fun a unit about military. you haft to use tactics lots of fun. but one thing about it is that haft to have a good pc to run the game.",5
"this game takes you closer to reality than any other combat game i have ever played. a must-have if you are a fan of combat simulators that allows you to fight on land, sea and in the air. i do recommend playing it with a few friends, as it can be hard to get good teamwork going with a bunch of random people.",2
"i only play the multiplayer. addictive and time consuming, but worth it. so many map and server style choices to choose from, its hard to stick to just one.",1
"first arma game love it really easy to get into worth the money",1
"tried to get on a ferris wheel on a server and it insta killed me. 0/10 would not play again.",1
"this games engine is so inefficient, one might wonder what the developers have been doing for the last several years. i would recommend it for the hardcore military-sim lovers, but for anyone else who plays video games for entertainment - i would not. i have a gtx 780, the game is installed on a 500/500 ssd, and i have a formidable 3770k intel processor. the game gets around 15fps on average, occasionally hitting 30 when i look at the ground. its unacceptable for a game that is no longer in beta.",1
"i would play this allday if i could its a really fun game, but you better have a beast gaming computer to get atleast 20 frames.",2
"the best simulator and its called arma! literally the best game ive ever played",1
"one of the best games i have ever played defently worth buying :d",4
"very good so many things to do i would deffently recommend this game!!",1
"i really do love this game. its great when you have a group of people to play with, but not so much for solo play. it lacks a wide range of weaponry, but the mods help fill in the gaps left by bi. recomended if you have friends toplay with.",1
"a black guy shoots you in altis life and then gets beheaded by a chopper 10/10",1
"very good game, would recommend it to anyone who wants to feel like they are playing a realistic shooter not your silly game style that comes with call of duty!",1
"doesnt get better than this game where you can go whereever on massive maps and use helicopters airplanes, boats, submarines, tanks, and jeeps in one battle. 12/10",1
"it is a improvement on arma 2 ... mods are cool too!",1
"1. fix the ai intelligence 2. fix the neck rubberbanding 3. fix the fatigue 4. fix bugs such as not being able to heal and forced walking",1
"this game is just as incredible as arma 2. the only thing i do not like about it is its extremely infantry based, with little combined operations.",2
"this is the best version of arma series. many new modules are very useful for mission editing",1
"this game is a very good. the graphics are amazing and the game play is just what you would expect out of an arma game. and i love what they did as far as the epoch mod goes. they still have some bugs to work out but nothing you cant work with.",1
"dont get this game if you dont plan on playing it with mods. seriously. dont do it. vanilla a .",2
"well bohemia did it again what can i say its the best war simulation out there get this now !!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"yes i would recommend i watch videos of arma 3 and there cool",1
"[10/10] fantastic game! altis life! hours of fun! a great sequel to arma ii!",2
"arma 3 is an improvement over the previous ones, but the game still suffers from clunky interface and lackluster ai. for an arma fan like myself, though, it is the best arma so far.",1
"from the outside looking in arma iii imitates the best and worst aspects of postmodern war. the vast majority of your time in this game will be frustration from shear amount of bordom, that is until a firefight breaks out & its the most intense game youve ever played. the juxtaposition between these two emotions is not unlike every headcam video of a soldier at war that are all over the internet, so if that at all interests you, id say buy arma iii.",1
"i recommend this game to anyone who likes a more realistic type of shooter. this game also has a big modding community so there are tons of different ways to play the game. controls are most fluid then arma 2 and it feels more natural and less mechanical. it does still have a slight mechanical feel but that just goes with the genre. every act requires you to take a second to complete that task just like rl. i didnt log many hours when i first got it but iv recently found servers that run the sc (sector control) game mode and its fantastic. you gain levels by being in the target sector and money to buy new gear. il keep this brief but its a great game and keeps getting better with every update.",1
"this game is really worth the $ i reccomend you get it because its really fun and exciting it feels like im in the war!",1
"easily the best, most polished installment of bis arma series. ive been playing bi games since 2001s operation: flashpoint. its amazing to see how the same engine (real virtuality) has evolved over the years, errrr decades actually, wow its been a while - now i feel old. so, in summary, arma 3 is a complex and realistic simulator that allows players to realize the rapidly impending date of their last breath, to know that every second that ticks by their billions of cells die just a little bit more, their neurons demyelinating, and their arteries incrementally hardening. its a firm unyielding grip that death has upon us, he authoritatively clutches the keys to the universe in one bony claw and simultaneously our hearts and souls in the cold phalanges of the other. thank you arma 3 for revealing the terrifying reality of my mortal existence. in death we are infinitely alone, no one to hear our trembling wimpers as we rock back and forth in the dark corner of an unending void of pure, sterile, black nothingness that warps us further into catatonia. score: 10/10",2
"very good. all that running in this game is good for your thighs and heart. and lungs. 100000000000000/10",1
"what? why are you reading the reviews? why havent you already purchased this yet? arma 3 is the epitome of virtual tactical military-based operations and simulation. in my eyes, this game is not just a simulation of military firefighting and combat; i find this game is a great practice for team-based cooperation and initiative. you need to work together to complete your goal, follow your team leader to succeed. there are many game modes that simplify the standard operations so new players will be able to experience the game in a friendly and forgiving environment that allows you to improve your abilities. arma 3 is a grand game and i definitely recommend it.",2
"i have always been a fan of the arma series because its really different than the other shooters. there are so many different ways to play this game, i spend hours scripting and fooling around in the editor for my own enjoyment. i dont play multiplayer that much but its still a great experience when i get to it. this game is very heavily gpu and cpu dependant so i wouldnt reccomend this to people who have a low-mid range gaming pc. mid ranges might still be able to run it but you will get lots of fps drops below 30 fps. this game is really fun and easy to get into. i am proud of the work that bohemia interactive is doing and continue to be a fan of their titles. i rate this game a 9.5/10.",1
"i cant say much about the games single player experience, since i havent really done a whole lot with that. what i can say is that in large scale co-op missions, you really see this game at its full potential. this is easily one of the best co-op experiences ive ever had, and ive been gaming since i was 3 years old.",2
"this game is fun, looks great, and is just straigh up awesome. pros: graphics new vehicles new weapons sounds gameplay large maps ability to customize your weapons attachments ways to store more gear other than a backpack. ability to move fast while prone/ do other things while prone (inventory, heal yourself etc.) cons: it may seems like it is laking content, but there are a lot of things to do not as big of a population in players that there was in arma 2 the npcs dont seem to notice you as often so you can really just shoot them a lot w/out being shot at unless youre really close. this game still has more to come and i would recommend it.",1
"this game is great! even though it currently has some interface issues, the gameplay is awesome, the mods and different gamemods keep you playing for hours on end, and the graphics look almost real as you see each individual piece of grass sway in the wind... if you like war simulation games then im sure you will probably get your moneys worth out of this game.",1
"it is so nuch fun and flying in a heli is awesome the plans are even better the guns are awesome all i have to do is hold down the trigger",1
"i played the alpha lite, and was not too impressed by arma 3, i saw it on sale and bought it. i can say i do not regret my choice. im having a blast with it thus far. if you played arma series before, you know what you are in for. content wise its lacking compared to 2, but that has been out longer. i have faith in the community to make some intresting mods for this game.",1
"simulator that only one in the earth that satisfied graphics, reality",5
