"arma 3 is an improvement over the previous ones, but the game still suffers from clunky interface and lackluster ai. for an arma fan like myself, though, it is the best arma so far.",1
"bought it in alpha for wasteland after enjoying it so much in arma 2. not too much was added when it went through beta and final release. now with zeus, battle royale and a lot of other addons and mods coming it, there is too many reasons to list to buy and play this game. ive easily sunken another good day off from work just playing zeus with my clan.",4
"im not into the futuristic crap they brought into this franchise. luckily the arma community have some awesome mods - check out armaholic",5
"arma 3 is a big fail.not in alpha state but definitely not completed. game changes from update to update,also addons stop working with new version.you might say its normal because new version has fixed the bugs.wrong again.new version go on conflict with addons that worked very well from day 1,as for bugs...stil not solved,very often fps drops and connection issues between client and server. gameplay...lame...for 2015 arma 2 was a big hit. arma 3 is another version on arma 2 with new tweaks. annoying dlc screen while flying in vehicles from dlc.",9
"kerry: lieutenant, do you read me over? james: go ahead corporal kerry: i could really use, some help i got nothing here james: thought you yanks coulndt get enough freedom? kerry: we respect lieutenant, f*ck you! 69/10",1
"what more to say? coming back to this from a few years away and its great to see how its developed. being a fan from arma, arma 2 and even vbs 2, you cant go wrong with checking this out. but there are conditions: you have to love the milsim side of life, you can do anything. you have to persevere also. you will die. again and again... this game will suck you in. big time....",3
"ok first off holy crap this game is sweet. if you cant pay the normal 60 bucks wait till it goes for les( i got mine for 30 i think) i would call it a military simulation with a shooter twist. a great game thats lots of fun. you can be seriouse and treat it like its real life or just  around like i do most of the time and blow stuff up. if you liked dayz in arma 2 there is breaking point wich i play and that is pretty good but can get a little frustrating. but over all 10/10 would buy again. seriously if your pc can handle it get it.",4
"watch the showcases, (theyre old but you should be able to find them) theyre about 14 minutes long and show off lots of cool features, including disguises and much more. this game is not finished and needs to be updated still.",4
"kind of glitchy but a load of fun and an insane amount of depth. if you are a fan of games with a good amount of tacticality, this is a must buy even at its pricepoint.",1
"joined a match, jumped out of an airplane to darude - sandstorm. 10/10",1
"the teamwork is great if you get the right people. a little sad how it performs with the amd cpus. +",2
"this game is one of the best simulators i have ever played. it contains many improvements to the engine, graphics, and controls since arma 2. this game has been made better by the steam workshop to host a ton of downloadable senarios. i would recommend you play this game with friends, or some sort of community. some negatives of this game, is its performance, i requires a powerful computer to play, even then there is some sort of performace drop. also there was a lack of single player content, but there is now some being released. im looking forward to the future of this game as it gains popularity, and plus with all the cool expansions arma 2 had, there will probably be new content in the future. one more thing is that there is a huge difficulty spike because its a simulator. this is no call of duty or battle field, and requires alot of time to get used to. if you never had any experience with arma games and you are not shure if you should get arma 3, buy arma 2 + oa, it has been on sale recently for really cheap.",1
"i have always been a fan of the arma series because its really different than the other shooters. there are so many different ways to play this game, i spend hours scripting and fooling around in the editor for my own enjoyment. i dont play multiplayer that much but its still a great experience when i get to it. this game is very heavily gpu and cpu dependant so i wouldnt reccomend this to people who have a low-mid range gaming pc. mid ranges might still be able to run it but you will get lots of fps drops below 30 fps. this game is really fun and easy to get into. i am proud of the work that bohemia interactive is doing and continue to be a fan of their titles. i rate this game a 9.5/10.",2
"its not a good game for newbies. no, its not... i use to sit at a place and watch the sunset. i have no idea how to actually shoot, drive and complete missions. its like my personal sunset simulator. and its damn beautiful. 10/10",10
"arma 3 is a really good game. if you feel like a real army game, go and play arma, good tactics etc makes your team win. for the roleplayers out here, they are also at the right addres, arma has an rp mod called altis life this is fantastic for people who love rp with good graphics. i really recommend this game for actually every player who loves an army game and for people who seek real roleplay",4
"arma 3 is an amzing game. if you owned arma 2 and experienced terrible fps, then this is the game for you. they amazingly increased the fps in the game, and it has amazing graphics.",1
"sorry to say that but the game is running on a low frames and i just cant play the game normally ,its lagging and i cant kill anyone . ill not recommend this game from a minimum specs pc cause it will lag as ...",1
"absolute crap in recent updates have always been a loyal arma player but optimization in the last few updates have made the game unplayable on mid-high range systems you need a beast of a rig to run this game now i stronlgy reccommend for the averge player dont waste your money on this anymore",2
"awesome game!!! i play this after a hard day at work. recommended",2
"worst game ive ever played. bare bones in terms of content. the campaign is utterly stupid. super marksman enemy ai from the first arma game is back. perfoms like crap. campaign missions are awful. worst game in the entire series not worth the price of 59.99 not even worth the price of the early alpha that i paid for if i could get a refund for this garbage i would. this is the last arma game and the last game from bis i will ever purchase.",1
"i bouth this game in alpha for 20 euro, now its for 45 euro. enjoy",1
"this game is great but i expect more thoe, but anyways its a great game. i havent tried the other mods yet and this game is still great. so this game has a lot of content. also its sad that it the dlcs are a bit overpriced for the content it offers. also one of the things i dont like about arma 3 is that they didnt use real names of weapons and vehicles. even has fake guys like the mx rifles. considering this to be a military sim, i expect real weapons and vehicles.",4
"its an ok game best part of the game is obviously its multiplayer but with the constant connection problems it can be a drag and its not realy worth a buy considering other games do mp better!",1
"great game id pay $100 for this! its a must buy if you like real life type shooters.",5
"great game! i always loved the arma series it begon with ofp first arma and the graphics of this game are stunning! but i dont like the future vehicles ect but its awsome with mods :d",4
"sandbox multiplayer is awesome. dont even bother going to in-game gun stores. grab whatever rifle and equipment you can and make use. i found a submachine pistol and a silencer, a smoke grenade and some glow sticks. left my car running on a busy road at night with the lights on and watched it. surrounded it with glow sticks. killed three people and came away with a decent back pack, rifle and grenade launcher and a ghillie suit. with space to pack my handy little pdw. dont get angry when you get shot after hunting down the perfect kit and have to hike for miles and miles again. downside @ 29/11/14 is there are a lot of hackers at present and its ruining the fun. this game still gets 5 out of 5 stars",2
"if you like long awkward clunky yet somehow amazingly fun combat and keybinding that makes you want to shove a potato in your grandmas windpipe then yes this is a good game...... i guess 10/10 would play again",1
"this game can appeal to every type of player due to its verstility and ability to be changed. if someone wants action they can make a map restricting players ar a.i. to that town for close quarter engagements. if someone wants to play a realsim server and wait for hq to get a mission, and assign it to squads after the recon team has gone to a nearby hill and marked enemy locations, you can. arma 3 is the most versatile game where anyone can find what they want to play. armas engine can handle a lot of people per server and still runs the game really well despite there being 40+ people shooting at each other.",1
"got it just for altis life and found there was much more to it!",3
"i do reccomend this game, as far as military sims go there is none finer. the mod support is wonderfull essentially turning one game into several possabilities.( altis life, breaking point, epoch, and the regular wasteland) not to mention the hundreds upon hundreds of single player mods. the graphics are stunning when compared to arma 2 as the improvemts to the ui and over all controll of character and game elements make it much smoother than its predicessor. on the negative side are bohemias ugly dlc content. the karts are cool and for the now price of 1.99$ sure why not. however the newest installment of arma3 choppers is a cash grab ripoff, allow me to explain. this dlc offers 2 choppers that were already in game, that just couldnt be piloted. essentially they added a little scripting tweak to allow players to use them some other supportive bells and whistles to go along with them and stuck it with a 16$ price tag....i cringe to see what the upcoming marksman dlc offers compared to the price. buy the game, well worth the money...however i would hold off on purchasing dlc untill the price drops, which it will inevitably do.",3
"absalutly brilliant il give it ***** stars hope i get the full game soon i would sugest more classes it is fun with them but mabe something like a spy with a knife amd suppresd pistol (any just if it can have a suppresor ) and maby a juggernaught with duble health and a lmg brilliant if u can get this on the fulll game",1
"why play these games when you could be playing custers revenge",2
"10/10 stars if you can look around the small issues they are still having with the servers this game is on the top of my list to play, with or with out friends. if you like intence cqb style combat this games for you, if you like slow pase combat, if you like flying jets or helicopters, or if taking controil of a tank plt/convo this game is for you. the story is full of life and altho its a steep learning to this game its worth every hour you put in to it trainning with your friends, on even alone take it from me. by: travis borges > i approve this message",5
"arma, a game that smokes weed what you are suppose to do in arma: -spot enemies -tacticailly ambush enemies and outsmart the ai what players really do... -grow weed -try to kill each other with go karts -hunt turtles underwater 10/10 wrong game simulator",1
"realism: this is the key of this game but it is realistic for real ? if youre a gamer you could probably say yeah becouse there are some elements that makes everything feel a real war... ...but (!!!) in my opinion this realism is not so realistic. war feeling is awesome but the bad things on this game are the details ( weapons reload, medkit others, repairing vehicles, your blood that desappears when you put adrenaline (???) in yourself...) this game is worth buying for people who likes the genre, but i expect more couring of details in next patches .",1
"tang harlem whiskey yankee mike they even have my tactical vest in this game  the government dorner 4 lyfe lol :d 10/10?",1
"is arma 3 for everyone? no arma 3 is a military simulator with more emphasis on realism than action or fun. those who enjoy the experience will find it incredible, but i would recommend doing some research beforehand to make sure the game is right for you. the good: - incredibly detailed open world-style maps - wide range of weapons, vehicles, and equipment - incredibly powerful editor and high mod compatibility with a large community always creating new content. - top notch graphics that will strech even the most hardcore gaming pc the bad: - very high system requirements, dont expect to get a good frame rate without a decent system - network issues can be an issue from time to time - though much improved over arma 2, the character movement and vehicle handling can be clunky and a bit glitchy at times. overall i would say arma 3 is a very good game that will continue to only get better over time as the community and the developers create more and more content. however, if youre on the fence about it, make sure you do some reasearch before jumping into this title.",4
"the one thing redeeming about this game was king of the hill. they just broke it witrh the newest patch. donty waste your money till they fix it because its unplayable.",3
"i have no idea why, but this game is kind of boring. i want to like it, but i cant...",1
"one of the better fps games on the market.a must have game.better than call of s and battlefield. 10/10",1
"this game can provide endless amounts of fun and entertainment. it is great for being serious and tactical or goofing off.",4
"this software is beautiful, absolutely. but the game play is slow and frustrating, making it a negative experience. the ai is absurdly accurate too; you can hide back as far as you want and it doesnt help.... you could have run so far that those enemies are tiny dots even through your scope, hidden under a few bushes and trees a long ways away, and they will still repeatedly headshot you. then you can spend another eternity getting back to where you were in that mission. a few minor bugs aside, i found a couple bugs with the checkpoint system; one example is in an early mission where you are swimming from a boat to attack a small village with a few scuba buddies... but on several occassions that i restarted that mission the npcs would go completely brain-dead and do exactly nothing. it is a gorgeous product, i just wish there was a high quality game with it.",1
"best military simulation right now. not the best game engine (needs good cpu), but very rewarding and much more in dept and challenging than cod or bf. i really like this games and all the mods it has to offer from the great community. most fun for me is being gunner in a big tank, flying a jet or cleaning towns on foot with teammates. recommend for everyone that likes playing in a team and has some friends to play with.",4
"this is the best version of arma series. many new modules are very useful for mission editing",1
"fantastic game. the endless possibilities of game modes like altis life and wasteland have dominated my gaming time. its hard to switch to anything else once you get used to the intense controls. campaign is solid till it feels slightly repetative and alienating. once you go co-op, you open yourself to a world of new possibilities.",1
"great game, mechanics are great, co-op campaign is good, what bothers me is the price, i can understand it, but its quite the number",1
"it was feckin amazing. i recommend it to everyone but the only downside is you need a good ammount of cpus otherwise you will struggle to get even 10 fps",1
"cant go invert on xbox controller fix it please i cant play otherwise",2
"if youre looking for a military simulator then arma 3 is your best bet. realistic gameplay. great graphics and sound effects. lots of gameplay modes available.",3
"please rudse the price of arma 3 to 24 again so i can buy it for all my mates arma 3 is so fun to play when you have got some friends on the game to its just greate i think everyone should buy it when it goes down price of coruse :d",2
"this game is just bout the most amazing thing ive ever played, and the zeus dlc adds on tens of thousands of hours of gameplay onto the already huge playability factor... some glitches, lots are pretty funny to witness in a subtle way... and the modding community is crazily active. i would buy this again if i had to, steep price, but it is entirely worth what you pay. this game coming from people who have had contracts with different governments to make accurate virtual battle enviroments for training. ---get it---",7
"ran towards a tank butt naked firing a pistol. got blown to hell.10/10.",2
"this game is pretty fun. the game types you will have the most fun with is probably any type of life server. epoch is also fun, but what out for the exploding zombies. and finally king of the hill, this game type is the kind that most people play because its the most competitive. nevertheless, you should get this game. have fun with it.",1
"this is one of those games that is very hard. (thats what she said). but anywho this game is worth it. no only is it every going to cease to be fun, but it has infinte replayabliaty. only 1 con is that the weapon sway is hard to get use to. 9/10",2
"i love arma 3 still doing the campaign though but the desynch on multiplayer is horriable everything except for that 10/10 so right now i would give it 8/10",3
"went to a weed field to gather some cannabis and got arrested by undercover cops. 10/10 would sell weed again.",2
"still runs like a big pile of poopydoodoo. single player campaign is not finished. feels like a beta but it is the official release.",1
"hands down a game changer as far as tactical gameplay goes.",3
"graphics are bad. they shouldnt build a game trailer based on their low graphic cinematics, that wont help them sell the game.",1
"shooty shooty good, driving okay, flying hard. 10/10 bullets either tickle or are fired near you and you die.",2
"meh...dont get exited for this game its kinda bad!",1
"the most realistic shooter i have ever played. it is not optimized very well especially if you are running older hardware but if you have a decent enough computer you will never forget the experiences this game will bring you. my first day a3 i was on wasteland gametype just running around with my pistol. out of nowhere a helicopter loaded with enemies was flying directly towards me and i decided it would be a good idea to shoot at drawing attention to myself. turns out this was a good idea as the helicopter heads directly for me as if it was about to land ontop of my head, instead it takes a nosedive into the ground killing everyone inside. 10/10 would shoot down choppers again(with a pistol)",1
"great game for hardcore gamers cant wait for what more is to come in this game",1
"this game is very good if you enjoy hardcore action. no other shooter will get your heart racing like this game! you feel like you are in the battle, because it is so real! this game is not friendly to newbs or people who arnt used to pc games. it is also not friendly to people who dont have patience. the action in this game is fantastic, yet hard to play. it is still in alpha, but it has alot of potential. it is a simulator, so dont go jumping in thinking its your adverage shooter. this is my favorite shooter of all time right next to bioshock infinite. if you are looking for hardcore, real world wars alongside your friends, than this is perfect for you! <3",2
"i got global banned from both arma 3 and dayz sa because i piked up hacked money in an altis life server. complete",1
"this is one the best combat simulators ive ever played. the sand box on here is a blast and the steam work shop is awesome for user created content. the only down fall for me is that i dont have anyone to play this with.",4
"excellant combat simulator. this is not a cod/bf type game, it is a simulator of real life combat operations, you can die from one round etc. if you want as close to a real war experience as possible without real bullets flying at you this is your game. perform as infantry, helo pilots, fixed wing pilots, tank crewmembers etc and work with your squad to achieve victory. very well done game, lots of mods and community content, definitely worth the money.",1
"i very much enjoyed the game. with 50 mods installed the game alone is boring and empty",3
"ive had this game for 3 days... i already have 34 hours on it",2
"although the reliability of certain game mechanics and functionality is far from optimal, youre forced to cater to the games faults, making it that much more gratifying to master. modded servers are unreliable, at best, when servers are filled to the brim. accidentally falling from a 2 1/2 step will kill you. sometimes you get stuck in objects like walls and floors. sometimes, items disappear from your inventory and occasionally your inventory just isnt there, its gone. sometimes, sometimes a bunch of assclowns ddos the modded servers to frustrate the people playing. sometimes.....sometimes arma sucks hard, really hard. its bad enough to where, at times, it turns you off to gaming in general and makes you rethink your hobbies. sometimes it makes you regret building a computer just to handle its heavy processing load and having your heart torn out when it takes 48mins to join your favorite server, for it to never happen. but then, i remember, arma is intensely intricate. things can be done and scenarios can be played out, only on arma. this is a big boys game, taking patience and intelligence. you buy this, i guarantee that you will hate life 40% of the time you play it. you dont buy this, youll regret it for the rest of your life. 10/10 *ps: dat altis life doe",7
"i would reccomend it its a brilliant game, not alot of bugs that i could see and the mods and dlcs that come with it are boss",1
"if you love milsim this is the alpha male of that category!!! enjoy and check out my youtube",2
"its a great game. to bad i cant afford to put even 5 dollars towards it.",5
"good game. game good. price-not good. dont buy it yet.",1
"seem to bight and blochie. the physics engin seem broken. seems less gun to me. need dlc for certain things. avatar seems always hurt even at full health. the scnery was nice. modding guns was ok. keybored actions had me tripped up a bit. i give this game 3/5",1
"liek 10/10 - ign m8 you will not even know what is happening but den you step on a explosive and die. 10/10",3
"great game fantastic if you want a military sim somewhere in the near future",1
"really fun and realistic game, i just wish setting up servers that work were a little easier...",1
"saw a war movie went to play arma,saw anything related to combat or warfare went to play arma ;) one of the most addicting games and military simulation i ever played! endless mods packs,maps,mission and game modes! you can just can do there almost anything that refers to war and military simulation and even more than that,starting from making missions in the editor and playing with friend,playing on public server or even joining a clan that suits you,joining a pvp server as king of the hill,free for all or just any other pvp modes also if you feel for some role play there is also some from that as well!! as i said game of endless contact that keeps expanding and getting new thing while thats being created only by the community there are also the devs that are keep updating and making the game better. as you can see i realy recommend buying this game,worth it! :)",4
"great game, tons of mods to choose from so ur sure to find something u like, wether its big battlefield style combat, or trying to run guns and drugs across the border, and of course zombies. great graphics, runs very well, nice and smooth, and brings a level of realism to shooters that is not seen elsewhere.",7
"love the game, but the community is obcessed with some kinda second life type rpg. the community use to be cool but now its just a bunch of stuck up euro trash and dewbs.",2
"you battleye, i got global banned for no ing reason? well  me. i cant ing play anything that uses battleye thanks to the head that set up the ban system, you think you have all the kinks worked out of the battleye thing, well you ing dont.  this , im out.",1
"i played during a free weekend on steam. things i liked: realistic gunplay and movement. graphics look pretty good. online multiplayer in modes such as wasteland are very fun. basically dayz w/o zombies (although there is a mod like dayz for arma 3). what i did not like: while the game played smoothly for single player the multiplayer played not nearly as well. i would get around 15 fps even though i am above the minimum requirements. this may be able to be resolved with more tweaking or patches in the future. i have found a set of servers that seem to run pretty good however so i usually stick to those. from the time i spent with it during the free weekend (10 hours) i was convinced to buy it for the 50% off price of $30.",1
"great gramphics great grameplay. not nescassarely a good thing.",1
"if your an arma fan this game wont dissapoint. its not fps in the sense that you dont have a health bar ect, one shot can kill you if placed right. this makes for using tactics all the more important. you dont just charge into a fight guns blazing, instead you tend to plan your approach and put alot more effort into each scenario. this is a true combat simulator and the best ive played of the arma series so far.",1
"very good game bt there is so much glitches that need to be fixed but great game. recommend this game to people who are patient it is alot of traveling. i have enjoyed it since having it.",3
"this game is amazing. its all you want from a game. want to kill people? done. want to fly? done. want to fly a goat? done",1
"if you can get past the bugs and community, this title will surely leave you satisfied without costing an... arm and a leg. ...when do i get paid?",2
"fantastic mil-sim with a huge modding community and a wide variety of gamemodes. if you want to bomb a plane into a prison on a life mod, go ahead! if you want to lead you team of tanks the the forest moving everything down, you can do that too! this game is brilliant and i would highly recommend that you pick it up if you dont have it. try out some gamemodes and experiment with some mods and find out what suits you best. 12/8 m8",5
"i was somehow allowed to review this game, despite not owning it. 10/10",1
"come join my new server! help me expand my player base and help the server become popular arma 3 epoch with all-terrainpack enabled. - 88.150.150.250:2382 temaspeak 3 - 85.236.100.27:19147",3
"the best war sim ive played so far hell yeah! 10/10",2
"excellent , hard but excellent , the best money ive spent on a game since carrier command ( by the same people )",2
"bought some lsd in altis life, ran from the cops when they noticed purple smoke coming from my truck. and hired a getaway helicopter only to find out i didnt have the helicopter dlc. i got arrested and went to jail for 1:10:00 minutes. the guy in the helicopter tried to break me out of jail. i only then realized that u cant get in copilot if u dont have dlc. i am not a wanted fugitive and have 3 bounties of 10million on me. 100/10",2
"how can i review this and i dont have the game.. lol #toobroke",1
"best military simulator out there for the civilian market. game is extremely moddable, and options and different styles of gameplay are plentiful. great online experience for players who prefer to work tactically and cooperatively with other players. as close as youll ever get to combat.",8
"probably one of the most complex games i have ever played but i always want to keep playing it.",1
"best military simulator out there. multiplayer is fun and more polished than arma ii. loving the new features, too. if you liked arma ii, youll like this one, too. oh, and i forgot to mention you can mod it, just like arma ii. cant wait for ace.",2
"my dang multiplayer servers aint popping up in the server section why it do dis its a good games but that glitch sux",2
"this game... is 10/10, its super fun and their is so much to do, epoch, breaking point, arma 3 life, altis life, anything you want. and then not to mention but all the workshop stuff you can do. it is without a doubt worth $60",6
"if youre looking for a game thats both realistic and fun at the same time then this is the game for you.",4
"so many different games to play.. buy for a great time and endless nights of fun",2
"cant say enough good things about this game, especially in co-op mode. makes the call of duty series, and even the battlefield series, feel like arcade games. the realism it achieves elevates it above all others as a true combat simulator.",4
"one of the best military sims out there. if you like immersion/sandbox, then you will love this.",5
"t-bagged someone with only a combat helmet and night-vision goggles. 12/10",3
"the game is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)",1
"thanks arma 3 for teaching me about the metric system.",3
"best military sim and most interesting mods for one there is. recommend!",1
"while playing i take off my clothes and carry bloody men around while they float like ghosts behind me like ghosts",4
"missleading requirements.... the minumun cpu is i5.. this game is garbage for amd cpus as well.. this game would had been amazing but the programmers of this game, game engine are noobs in their proffession.. its a stoneage technology.. seriously they should fire every programmers they have and recriut newly graduate... their employees need to go back to school.. you cannot call them professional anymore.. people with high end pc should boycot this so that we will be forcing them to freaking create app that can use of multicore cpus....",2
"this is a bad game because of people have that white-list and you can not be a police man on atlis life, medic this is also pots me and my friends off this game and it is also not a fun game with other people and friend because of the spown sports.",1
"its a really nice game if you are into realistic shooters, but somethings i personally dont like is the maps are horrible if you can compare it to chernorous or takistan, and the map is one of the most important things in this game(mp). the last thing thats negative is when you play on 60+ servers, it tends to have an awefoul dsync problem and kills all the fun you could have in the game. otherwise this game is exstreamly good and the stuff i mention is going to fade away over time. sorry about my english typoes.",1
"this game is actually pretty good i like the fact thats its an open world fps, maximum graphics are nice the game isnt laggy or freezes or anything sounds are nice, physics are nice, vehicles and weapons are nice its an in the middel game its average. i like it",1
"amazing game, honestly. its a very fun game to play with friends or alone, i prefer it with friends though :3 10/10",4
"so far only played the epoch mod. tried the campaign and as soon as im done with the tutorial, i recieve an error message. tried reinstalling the game and deleting the mod files. still doesnt work. but the mods make up for that so id still recommend this game but wait till its on sale, steam always has sales.",1
"its a military sandbox with semi-realistic elements but poorly optimised.",2
"i really like this game i like the gamemodes for multiplayer. i liked the singleplayer it was still fun, there are a few glitches in the game but i dont care that much because it is an amazing game and i will never regret buying this game i would recommend this game4 to everyone.",3
"this is the best millitary simulator since operation flashpoin. game play takes in account many aspect of real world millitary scenario. complex operations or just a simple single missions with tons of inventory and vehicles.",2
"greedy dlc, the game is still in beta. the funnest thing to do by far is koth online but good luck getting in a server, randomly the server broswer will flip out and report 0 servers. at which time the only solution is to completely restart the game. every time hearing that stupid theme when it starts up, duh duh dunnn duh! server broswer reports 0 servers, restart.... duh duh dunnn duh! 15 bucks for a couple of rifles and diffrent color guillie suits <.<, helicopter pack 15 bucks, still in beta my . money grab, poorly optimized 6/10 duh duh dunnn duh! ....... 5/10",3
"this game made me an operator,its so tactial 30 minds ride to fire one bullet and die,also made me pop boners on tacticool gear,all in all i give if 9 out of 10 dynamic stories,if only the fps was operational level i would operate with other operators,",1
"yeah i reccomend it as i crash all the time but im hoping to fix that soon and the times ive been able to play it was a fun time killing ai",1
"really fun game, i found myself building my own missions based on my experiences in afghanistan. i like the level of interaction in the editor.",3
"i can really recommend this game, its just awesome for so many reasons !! :d",1
"if you have a high end gaming pc and you are interested in heavy military simulators definitly get this game. its the few of its kind with that much detail and that level of simulation. its a really fun game.",2
"greatest army simulator ever, hard to get into, slow paced at times, but greatest at what it is, do reccomend.",1
"when i played arma 3 during the free weekend a few weeks ago, i enjoyed it a lot and i also like the graphics and the interface. it really fits in with the players. altis life rpg - definitely recommend it, go play it...",1
"i enjoy this for playing with my friends or just dicking around! picked it up when it was on sale for $36 and i would recommend that if you were to buy it you shold do the same.",1
"do not buy it! the cpu and gpu issues are so bad you will get 17fps slideshow in multiplayer on low/med/norm/high/vhigh/ultra settings, its a shame this game had a lot of potential, singleplayer is great but donr expect anything more then that. it will never be optimized for high end gaming rigs. bohemia are uselss and dont even care about the issues!",7
"if youre looking for a good time go into a game, of people trying to talk like real life military radio operators. its hilarious. 11/10",2
"this game can provide endless amounts of fun and entertainment. it is great for being serious and tactical or goofing off.",4
"definitely takes some getting used to with the new movements and all. but after going through a few times with the turtorial everyone should be well on their way to playing this amazing military simulator.",1
"10/10 best open world, war/simulator/first person/3rd person havent played a good open world army simulation sense joint operations!",1
"really fun game if youre into tactical and realistic shooters.",2
"best shooter game i have ever played! hands down the best graphics too. when playing, you actually feel like you are there. you also have the millitary tactics that your squad does. most of the people that play this were in the millitary! i give this game a 9.5/10.",3
"absolutely amazing game, never had as much adrenaline in my life! when you are in combat, it feels like you are in deep  in real life... dont masturbate after infantry combat, your hands shake and it is not physically possible, but hey...give it a try",3
"great simulation game! like arma 2 but better! fun with friends or strangers! buy it now!",1
"arma 3 is so good i dont have time to fully review it i just want to get back to playing.",2
"this game has a distracting dialouge, and with your guns it is impossible to aim and there are so many game-breaking glitches. in the first five minutes i walked infront of one of the npcs on the road and then he got stuck and i had to restart the entire game. i was playing it when it was free for a week but i highly do not reccomend that you buy this game at sixty dollars. there are many better things that you could spend that on. overall you should not buy this game.",1
"i think this game is a great military sim.it combines teamwork with tactics and mixes it up with mods and good bots that will give you a run for your money.now ive only played this for the free weekend so i cant give you a super good reveiw but i will say that from what me and my brother played that this game is vary fun and challenging game and we will definetly buy it in the upcomeing days",2
"arma 3 fixes almost everything that arma 2 had (gun handling, animations, physics, graphics, nighttime,flying,nvgs, etc) the best part of this game is the editor and mods because that is where the magic happens",1
"this game is the best military simulator ive ever played",4
"a great game for anyone who likes simulators. there are many different mods and gamemodes for anyone. from rpg to zeus, this game has everything.",6
"best game in the world armaa iii is one of the best games ive ever played in my life... cause its not just a war simulator... all the people would like this game cause : 1- if youre a kind of man who likes rpg games then you can just go and play arma iii altis life or the life mod... 2-if youre a kind of man who likes survival games then you can just install epoch or breaking bad mod and enjoy it 3-if you like pvp games you can just play arma iii wasteland or king of the hill or coop mod... so as you can see arma iii is just full of different mods and stuff... but people dont have same feelings...i like this game i my self but a guy with different feelings and needs would not . so youre the guy who chooses what to play i hope this review be helpful... and sorry for bad english :)",1
"this is an awesome game, totally reccomend it for everyone. so many mods, so much to do.",2
"full of vast scenery and realistic vehicles and weapons, arma 3 is a great open world tactical shooter. it is graphics hungry and even my 7970 struggles to run it well (although i havent taken to fine tuning the settings yet). the campaign was added after the release (which is weird) but its good and it helps the player in remembering the locations on the gigantic maps (like seriously stratis and altis are huge). combat is realistic (as far as i can tell), rp servers exist, coop is fluid, all in all a great game.",2
"this is what battlefield 3 should have been before ea got thier nasty little hands on it. this game is as close to the military as your gonna get without giving up your life for 4 or so years (at least from a civilians point of view). enough content to cover land, sea, and air. and gives you way to many options to play the way you want to play (for example. i play intel style). worth buying.",1
"really fun, both single and mutliplayer. just dont expect it to be like cod... its more realistic, and not so much arcade action all the time. still in beta, but is already a kick  game. *but be aware* - this game makes alot of people act like butt*holes in multiplayer. find the right server and all is good! :)",2
"arma 3 is a highly adictive game. there are tons of thing to do.i have only played 144 hours and still havent seen the whole experiance. multiplayer, amazing. singleplayer, amazing. you would have to do somehing quite spectacular to ruin your experiance with this game.",2
"if i could give this game 5 stars... i wouldnt... but 4.5 without question, this game is a tonne of fun if your looking for something way more realistic than battlefeild! best served with a squad and a large helping of patience... also expect many random deaths due to walls and stuff",4
"the best game i have ever played... unbeliavably realistic and just simply amazing, only took 1 hr to get that impression, get whilst u still can on 40% off, otherwise it is very expensive, but well worth it. the only problem is the fact u need a very good computer to run it on very high settings, which would make gameplay even better, however, my 2 year old laptop runs it well on high/standard settings mix. anyway, could rant on and on about how great this is, but basically... its mint",6
"the developers have an iq 100, but it takes 2 not to make such an amazing game! guards, play this game immediately or feel my wrath! if grodd played this, you always will! guards, i do not require your immediate assisstance with this game!",2
"got it in the alpha stage and have been playing it from time to time since. great game, one of the best in the series",1
"arma is a great game. there is so many game modes it is like 20 games in one. king of the hill sort reminds me of battlefiled and altis life is obviously gta. it also has a great well made missions. i got this game from watching videos on wasteland and already played wasteland in arma 2 i thought i must have this game. you love the way you look... i guarantee it",3
"there shouldnt be any in game purchases. this is how companies loose trust in their customers cause you turn around and screw us by trying to make a cheap buck. go f**k yourself bohemia!! you cheap  m*therf**kers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"ive got to say, this game is truly great in most ways.ive played for how long i do not know but i did play a lot, the problem is you play for hours and hours with doing almost nothing to just get killed by someone who has all the stuff...",1
"i shot a 120mm round at a guys knee... i never saw him again 10/10 would recommend",2
"after the recent update most of the desync was gone, marvelous work. 10/10 would crash the vehicles again.",7
"i truely love this game, i have a clan in it that we all play and do missions and a lot of other things on the side. this game has its issues such as animation and its ai can be stupid. but it can be a challage and i find challages very fun. this game does need more weapons and vehicles in my opinion but all around its a great game to play with your buddies.",7
"quite fun! graphics are great and runs very well. weapons and vehicles are amazing! 9/10",1
"great game, but the thing i really dont like is that you need a good graphic card to play it! but overall great game",1
"ive only played a little, i like it alright i guess.",7
"my favourite game, the arma series is great. there is so much to do now that the campain is complete, zeus has been released, there is the editor and workshop to create your own content or play other poeples. hopefully there is more to come",6
"arma 3 is an interesting game with all the god awful driving physics for the trucks... but hey! lets get past that one con. arma 3 in general is a frun game, but when you have friends that play it, when i first bought arma 3 i played scenarios and got bored as hell in ten seconds flat, but when you really get into it and start playing altis life and make a gang with your friends and do all that kind of stuf like my friends and i do all the drug dealing, it really hits how the fun this game is, and how pretty it is depsite the driving physics.... 8/10 realy fun game pros: gameplay altis life online multiplayer cons: physics single player",1
"alright game. its poorly optimized so you need a monster to run this well. i run on low settings with a gaming laptop, my specs are 8 gb ram, 740m video card, and i get 15-20 fps which is super . comparatively, i play bf3 on high settings with 30-40 fps easily. overall, if it were optimized properly and the community worked together more, it would make the game a 10/10. however, lacking these aspects i have to give it a 6.",1
"does cod allow you to be pinned down for 6 straight hours in a house while you cry hearing screaming and dieing?",1
"its must have for all arma series fans. it would be appreciated by all military based people, gamer or not. in other words: the only, true military simulator, pushing you to the limits of your imagination; im sure - there are many of those, who learned something from this game. beacause in the world of arma 3 - possibilities are endless...",1
"really good game! military simulator with lots of gamemodes and great vehicles. its worth your money.",7
"some of the engagements you will get into on this game, other games like battlefield attempt to pull off but do not come close to feel at all realistic as it does in this game, would definitely reccomend",6
"the graphics are beautiful, gameplay feels realistic and its mindblowing even while its still in alpha stage development. although the system requirements are quite high, i completely recommend this game! buy it now.",3
"arma 3 is my most favorite game ever because of its great possibilitys. ofcourse it wont even come close to a real life experience but thats impossible. but in my opinion the devs really screwed it right now cause i need to re-add al my mods/addons to the game one by one and thats a little to much since i use over 200 different mods they shouldnt have changed the way to add en use new addons via the addon maps in the game directory cause the launcher is bad. im dutch sorry for my grammer i dont give a damn because i think everyone will understand im no grammer-nazi i recommand this game to everyone that likes a difficult realistic army simulator. lextig.",10
"the military sim with many many possibilitys, mods like dayz, mmo like survival games wastelands and many many more. the only drawback is the specs you need to get everything out of this game, with decent specs you get your moneys worth but if you have a very very nice pc you get amazing sights a couple of miles/km out.",1
"arma 3...... well not much to say really it is a very good game. definetly worth buying. only if you have a beefy pc though!!!!",1
"arma 3 is a game changer. going from call of duty, to battlefield, to this and its on another level. started it up, joined a server and met up with my squad. we rushed and invaded a small town where we were ambushed by tanks and snipers. one of my teammates was screaming through his mic as if this game was real life. after 20 minutes of trying to figure a way around the ambush we all got killed by a helicopter and respawned. two thumbs up.",1
"would not rocomend buggy and just awfull to play just get arma 2",1
"kinda cool game so far takes some getting used to but i cant wait until arma 4 comes out",2
"i like shooter games, and i always saw my brother playing them and they looked very fun. when i was old enough, i got call of duty and had a blast. i kind of expected that kind of fun from this game, but i was dissapointed. even on beginner difficulty the soldiers take 30 minutes to kill, and you take 2 shots to the foot and you are dead whereas you can shoot them in the chest five times and they ill crouch and order their whole squad to fire on you with their unrealistically impeckable accuracy. if you like pulling out your hair and the feeling of overwhelming rage, this is the game for you. if not, you are wasting your money.",1
"i was drving then my wheels blew out and i was kidnapped",1
"i really enjoy this game. this game is different to other wargames. you can make your own missions, the graphics are epic and the maps are 200km big! you can play alone or with friends. either way you will enjoy this game. i suggest this game to anyone who is wanting good gameplay and epic battles.",7
"play on a life server and get yelled at by a 10 year old admin",3
"played it for 2 hours during the free weekend! it was amazing! i was speechless at the graphics of the terrain, they were simply unbelievable! i was playing it on my new laptop and i was running easily above 40fps!!! i wish i could buy it but sadly i got no money left from my laptop :( the people playing it we great and supportive. it was slightly harder to handle driving at first but after 20 minutes it was easy! if you are thinking about buying this game and have the money, dont think!!!!!! just buy it :d !!!",6
"arma 3 is a good game. that if you havent played arma 2. this game doesnt have the same feel or the same look as arma 2. arma 2 is a better game in almost every way. this game feel likes it was cut short. it doesnt feel done. anyway, if you want a good arma game, go ahead and get arma 2 and operations arrow head. not a bad game, but arma 2 is much better. oh, and my i add this game is an fps hell. it doesnt play well at all, and its looks awful doing so",1
"the best game of the 2010s, i have to admit, it is even better than skyrim. the level of simulation and reality in this game, coupled with the combination of fun and play is amazing. i never thought that a simulation could be this realistic and fun at the same time! must buy, 17/10, absolutley amazing!!! you are an idiot if you dont buy this!",4
"very good made looks very nice with ultra settings, got so many gamodes aswell!",3
"this game rocks, if u have not got it yet,your a fool",4
"seriously a great game. amazing for modding. its definitely worth the $60.",1
"i love arma 3 ....and the game is amazing... but isnt it time for the bugs to get fixed ? i am tired of dying when going down the stairs...getting stuck next to rocks, getting stuck inside of rocks.... not being able to sit/lay down on a big *** flat hills/boulders .... release date: 12 sep, 2013 .... its almost 2015 ...",4
"this is, hands down, the best military simulator available. there is a steep learning curve and its not very plug and play, but a3 can deliver an incredibly rewarding experience if authenticity and realism are up your alley. the arma series has proven to be both a fun combined arms shooter as well as an invaluable training tool.",2
"i personaly think this is a great game becuse it has a nice engien a lot of gamemodes and mods and an active dev team. but its not perfect becuse it has some glitches and bugs here and there but otherwise good game 9/10",2
"if you like battlefield 3 or 4 for the graphics it has, youll appreciate this game. its a really different game though, if you have ever played arma 2 youll find yourself loving this game. when this was in beta i really hated it, regretted paying money for it at all, but then i realized it was a work in progress. the game has really been patched up a ton, the game is located in greece, on an island which actually exists in real life, look that up if you like, its awesome. anyway, when you are alone, not in combat and just walking into a little town and just listen to the ambient sound, youll fase off into another reality. i am not kidding, this doesnt feel like a game at times, playing on role-play servers really adds to that. tldr; great graphics. controls are wonky but thats the engine to blame, its the same engine as arma 2 if i am not mistaken, but once you get used to it its great. mod support is great as well, a lot of fun to be had. multiplayer is fully working, it has its flaws but nothing gamebreaking. hackers ive yet to be annoyed by, nothing too dramatic. price is a tad high, but knowing that black-ops is still rather pricey after a few years of being on the shelves, i think its a fair price since this game is better to begin with. definitely worth buying.",1
"this game is totaly waste of money for amd owners. getting too low fps with poor cpu - gpu usage. fps around 15-30 with high settings and its dramaticly same with low settings too. not optimized for amd cpu - apu. totaly unplayable for amd owners. i opened a ticket on steam cs for refund my money.",1
"amazing game, really good graphics and there is lots to do online.",1
"game = mods great game! constant hours played on altis life and a3l. the fact is this game is pretty boring without the mods added into it, most will agree with me! i think the highlight of what made arma 3 a popular game was the altis life mod which made a fun environment where communities could form and do rp within the game, that mod is recommened. however despite having nearly 150hours just on altis life, a new mod a3l i has sparked up and taken over in opinion. the mod is a other rp mod like altis life however more shops, a new map [lakeside] and is taken more serious but is more fun to be fair. from robbing banks to being in a high speed chase as a cop, you can do it all for yourself here. arma 3 is the game for you to get into the modded games community for sure, you may even make your own community out of it [own a server]. note this game also has improved graphics from arma 2 and really is smooth when playing [no more desync]. ratings below: arma 3 [no mods]: 5/10 arma 3 [mods]: 10/10 thanks",6
"i cant say enough good things about this game. mil-sim with pretty engine. and finally a good campaign...",7
"i love this game 10/10 i love the guns and items and the user interface thats a big plus way better than arma2 why are u reading this go buy it now im going to buy thats for shore 10/10. :)",1
"awesome game! screw bf and cod this is where the fun is at!",1
"completely worthless game. textures dont load more that 100 feet infromt of you. controls are so unresponsive it is not worth playing. not even worth playing for free. this game missed its mark. all the nice landscapes and footage you saw in the video was cutscenes. total marketing lie",1
"this game is so beautiful it puts a video game to real life. if youre looking for a military simulator this is the one beautifully done, great structurely built multiplayer and singleplayer.",10
"solid game with plenty of mods and missions to complete! tries a little to hard to do everything",9
"arma 3 compared to arma 2 is a big improvement for sure, but it stills has a few issues and features that where in arma 2 that i would have liked to see in arma 3. overall its pretty good now since there are some great mods that have come out.",5
"i have very low fps on low graphic settings in arma 3 while my pc is able to run bf 3 on ultra without any glitches having much better picture. it is impossible to play this game. very bad.",1
"best consumer grade military simulation money can buy.",2
"a very good game althogh its difficult for the new players but its still intreseting and worth playing",1
"please be aware, this game does not work for many people. if you dont believe me please read teh forums about this ame. many people have this issue and no one has an answer/or is willing to help. i cant even get my $49.99 back.",1
"soo... i buy the beta at 59.99 but the game is now 35.99... i dont get this...",3
"i liked very much arma / arma 2 and now i am getting this one !",1
"10/10 real life simulator in a third world country.",1
"this game is really cool it is about military simulation if you get shot you got shot not like cod there is a gamemdoe where you can be a cop or a robber or a terrost or a civilian and you can do whatever you want its very fun you got tazers and realistic graphics",7
"well, every single fps is  compared to arma iii. just. this.",1
"this game is amazing. the graphics are stunning and the gameplay is just great. finally i get to play a massive war game. 10/10 1 word: amazing",1
"a more realistic battlefield/cod when you play modes like wasteland or king of the hill; can also be fun if you play the dayz mod for free; battle royal, do i need to say more? get dropped on an island with 30 other people, find a weapon and survival of the fittest!; if youre the roleplaying person, who likes to deal drugs, have s (women, who sell their bodies to greasy guys) or just be a corrupt cop, then altis life is just the right thing for you! so in general, this game offers are great variety of mods, its very own realism and its not full of garbage kiddies, who flame and pretend to have made love with your mother (like the cod-fanboys, lel) 10/10 would buy again",4
"somebody ran me over with a quad and broke my leg and i had to crawl 2km to a town..",1
"the realism aspect of this game sets it as the defenition of a military simulation. simulation is defined in this game by both the visuals and gameplay. 10/10 for anyone looking to be fully emerged into a great military simulator.",3
"contols take ages to get used to and its very complicated to operate. wouldnt recommend getting it, waste of money and time getting use to the game. graphics are good though",1
"it has a good fill, sound, you can make youer own battles play with friends good multiplayer and mack friends. you just have to get the game and see for youer self",5
"hosnetly not that fun. the controls are very clunky and the interface is unintuitive.",1
"a really interesting sandbox. basically build a story on your own, or play other player-made maps... includes normal deathmatch, coop story games and anything that can be made with your imaginations(requires some level of programming though) only for those who are willing to learn how to play and not just point and kill, like counter-strike. recommend to play as a group.",2
"the base game is pretty darn good but it gets way better with mods!",2
"great sandbox shooter with vehicles and mod support. you can swim and dive. you can play it as a shooter or a tactical game. and you can play a lightning shooting god with mind control. whats not to like?",1
"single player is good and runs pretty well, but the multiplayer is the most laggy thing in the world. i dont know why, i pass the recommended requirements. so this is why i would not recommend it.",1
"arma 3 is an excellent game for 2 reasons. number one, its engaging and immersive and fun, and number two is the fact that bohemia interactive cares about its modding community (hence the competition make arma, not war). but arma 3 comes with a few flaws. chief among these, in my opinion, is optimization as i own a very good mid-level pc and i seem to be getting around 16 to 20fps. also is the lack of vehicles and weaponry, although i know that is set to change, i would have liked the game to be complete and not an about to finish up beta. but if you have some friends that are interested, then why dont you visit the islands of altis and stratis. live a new life in altis or stratis life, fight for survival in wasteland, or work together to defeat opfor ai in invade and annex. just bare in mind that this is a military simulator, so no run and gun or rendezooks here, just good ol fashioned tactical warfare.",5
"what do i think of arma 3, well i have mixed emotions. i belive its a good game, but there are alot of reasons i dont play it as often. first for it being the game coming out after the previous arma 2 i was expecting certian things to be added, like better ai, a physics engine, and a much better map. i think i expected a little to much. some ups about the game is its fun! yeah get it like srlsy",2
"simulator that only one in the earth that satisfied graphics, reality",10
"not only is it one of the most beautiful settings in all of video games, it is the most accurate military simulator avalible, always great fun with large parties of friends, but you also meet great people by playing in game, recommend you get teamspeak for this game, and research some great mods, becuase it is a large community modded game which makes it even more fun. also watch some how tos before you play so youre not totally blind sided, also know this is not call of duty, the game involves tactics and survival instinct to play, you will get destroyed if you one man army in this game. only down side is you do need something relitivly powerful to run the game so look at your specs. otherwise great game.",1
"this is a great war simulator which suports realisim with real time 1st or 3rd person stratagy. go it alone our with a squad of ais or players and i general great game",8
"best military sandbox experience.. free community driven content.",3
"with this you can have fun !!!! ( altis life rpg ) if you want to be serious then you can have even more fun :) altis life rpg to be honest it took me a little while to adjust from playing arma 2 to arma 3 but once you have found your footing youll be a right happy chappy :) at this time the game is on a free weekend so i recommend that you try it .",2
"altis life, breaking point maaahhhh 10/10 coop 10/10",1
"the mods for this game are awesome. altis life and battle royal are great fun.",1
"buy it buy it buy it. i  you not, this is one freaking awesome game!",3
"this game is a must for anyone who likes military-simulation.",8
"got banned for calling someone, who had no life and were just chilling at the noobtown, son of a  on an altis life server. no admins are able to understand fun. 10/10 would definitly recommend",1
"a great game and ever evolving sandbox! i highly recommend this game.",2
"campaign is stupid hard. no coop. zeus is fun but only one person at a time. workshop content ranges from wtf ew no to that was really fun with a tendency towards the latter. dont get the game for a fun fps. get it as a military simulater: you take a bullet, youre dead.",1
"brilliant, it is not without bugs, but it is a brilliant military simulator!",6
"arma has long been one of my favorite modern military games. arma 3 started off rough but it is a very fun game for those who like that type. it is very satifying to play and the commuity of mods and addons is fantastic. the fact the game company allows so much modding is what makes this series great.",2
"its a lot like minecraft with all the mods and stuff... except without the blocks, and swords, and with more guns and explosions. but really though good game with free content",2
"beautiful game nice game if you have 60usd buy this game im trust",1
"full of glitches and the multiplayer is super laggy if you run on the same settings as you play on single player. it has super clunky controlls and weird animations which makes it feel unrealistic. i do not recommend this game to others",1
"this is a great game and well worth the money spent. however, since ive been playing from the begining of the alpha, its not quite as fresh as id like. good on its own, but far better with friends, a dedicated server, and some decent co-op missions. the dlc is not worth mentioning, unfortunately.",7
"i just realized ive logged in 263+ hours into this game without giving it a review. i have adhd, so its really hard to keep my attention, especially in games, a hobby i love. let me just say. arma 3 has taken 263+ of my hours while the upcoming game has only taken 180+ of my hours. really? is there anything else i need to say about this game?",4
"you only buy arma 3 for the mods. the rest of the game and missions are lacking allot! but if you like altis life and other mods, then this is the game for you. but the net-code is just as bad or worse then bf4 so keep that in mind. but this is not a dice/ea game so you should buy it and teach ea a lesson!",3
"great game. definitely not your average shooter, as you really need to know what youre doing otherwise you will not succeed.",1
"this game is very buggy, i have an average graphics card that can run most of the games out there but with this game, you need like a $9000 computer to even run it. the maps are way too huge for your graphics to run smoothly, i had to turn everything down and even still i was lagging like crazy. i would highly recommend playing the battlefield series instead of this game because a. you will get more enjoyment and entertainment from battlefield b. your computer will be able to run it c. better vehicle system and lots of weapons to choose from",1
"this review is more for australians than anyone else. sorry but the game just isnt ing fun for me, you really have to invest yourself wayyyyyyyyy too much into it to even remotely have an experience. and i have played the previous arma games so fight me. you know that a game has issues when everytime you boot it up you have to spend 10 minutes remembering the controls. sure american youtubers make this look so fun but if youre australian prepare yourself for a whopping 3 whole servers to play on. holy  dude thats insane lets see what we have. wasteland, a life server thats always full and some locked server. woooooow. but yeah real talk none of those leave a good first impression to a new player who cant even figure out how to teamspeak to get help. yes to someone who knows how to play this game is a fun  thing. but so many people who buy this game will probably play it once, think its boring, and then just uninstall it. and if that isnt a failure for the developers then all they care about is the money theyll get from these said people and thats just ing wrong. i give the game 8/10 for the best moments in it. and for the average experience a 4/10. dont buy this game if you dont know what youre getting yourself into.",1
"1,000 hours of great fun, if you are going to get this game. try out alits life, maybe even try and be whitelisted to a3l. stealing a police bus, being chaced my 10+ cops cars, and having people sceaming at you in the back scared for their life of my driving. all real people sitting behind their computer screens. some of the best moments of this game. ps, gotta love bob the log. the only log that went down the river.",9
"really fun game to play with friends many gamemodes/mission files to choose from great community :)",6
"really fun game! so many game styles to play, the modding community is fantastic, well worth the price!",7
"i was killed and i spawned in the middle of nowhere began running to god knows where suddenly i heard the sounds of a plane looked up there it was it landed smoothly in front of me 2 men came out, i was cautious but i didnt shoot just yet would you like to join us on our space adventure? hell ing yes i will we got in about 13km in the air were struck by lightning pilot says dont worry, i can land us safely alright ok cool pilot turns off engine we crash into a mountain they both died but i survived looted their bodies note to self: never go on space adventures",1
"i would recommend this game to the people that enjoy the arma series and as so if you enjoy a real experience and simulation to a real war and battle then you should buy this game.",1
"best military simulator without any doubt! and also a big modding community! 10/10",1
"great tactical fps with vide variety of gametypes and an acitve player base. excellent for players who want to really dig in and immerse themselves in the milsim experience. not really good for quick action packed plays.",1
"playing this game like its my job. really fun, i would pay full price any day of the week.",3
"this game is one of the best i have ever played.. if your into games about stealth, combat, shooting and driving tanks and helicopters, this is one for you! get it now while its cheap!",1
"frustrating hard game,even putting on easy settings didnt help.trying to play online is a bit naff as well,everyone just boots you off server.not very friendly at all it seems.its just a walking in a pretty forest simulator at the moment :)",1
"this game can appeal to every type of player due to its verstility and ability to be changed. if someone wants action they can make a map restricting players ar a.i. to that town for close quarter engagements. if someone wants to play a realsim server and wait for hq to get a mission, and assign it to squads after the recon team has gone to a nearby hill and marked enemy locations, you can. arma 3 is the most versatile game where anyone can find what they want to play. armas engine can handle a lot of people per server and still runs the game really well despite there being 40+ people shooting at each other.",1
"after playing an hour to check it out, well not my type of game, to much waiting, getting bored, never played arma but the concept i like very much , ....",1
"the next generation arma awed reviewers with promising graphics and an intense single player campaign. what seemed like a would be goty quickly has faded away. as people slowly, possibly dreadfully make the switch to arma 3 they will see it is a myriad of misfortune. with very little solid content to speak of compared to its predecessor it has left people in want. the game has been an overall disappointment for me, with a lowered sense of viable large scale combat, and very little aircraft to be talked of i was sorely disappointed at bohemia interactives next generation game in the arma series. the only thing that has made it playable is the limitless community made mods to add things that the developers seemingly forgot from arma 2. this causes me to not recommend this game.",3
"this an amazing military simulator with so many things to do! you can make your own battles on the editor, play the story line, or get mods and other missions that the arma iii community made! i wasnt sure about buying at first but now im glad i bought it!",1
"good -realistic (compared to cod or bf) -fun with friends -tons of gamemodes -good graphics -plenty of mods bad -overpriced dlc -low fps (aka the game is not optimised) -probably too difficult for new players to understand how to play",3
"one of the best games i have ever played. if you looking for something more than some bf4 this is the game. i highly recommend this to anyone.",2
"great game so many hours of fun with friends, this game gives the feeling of real combat and how it simulates that, great work on this game.",3
"this is one of the better games i have played from graphics to gameplay. it has multiple new weapons and vehicles, ai will actually be somewhat fair and not use their wallhacks, and pvp is suprisingly good. the only minor flaw about the game is that the ai still have very bad pathing in some areas and that they sometimes automatically know where you are. while mods can fix alot of what bohemia didnt, its still a very good game overall. definately recommended if you dont already have it.",3
"i would recommend this game because this game has lots of mods with it and its really funny.",1
"still some of the most bug infested games ive seen. texture and ground control is a joke, turn around to fast in a building and you might get killed. hide behind a rock? bad idea, as rocks have a tendancy to swollow you whole and spit you out somewere else to fall to your death. its a little strange really, seing that these things worked stably in games developed over two decades ago, like doom and wolfenstein 3d. is arma 3 still in early alpha?",6
"a futureistic shooter with i high learning curve and a very active community.",1
"if you dont get it now, youll be buying for $99 when its out.. 32$ for alpha/beta/full key atm, with the alpha being the current phase.. when you buy the alpha, youre in for life ..",9
"hell yeah i recommend this game. this game satisfies my thirst for fps games. the most detailed game ive ever played, in terms of actual in game mechanics. if you run too much you become tired, and aiming is much more difficult. if your hit in the leg, you might not be able to walk so you must crawl. the pain from being hit effects aiming aswell. most fps are very forgiving about death, which to me has always been a huge turn off about call of duty, getting shot in the back 24/7 and having a 1.0 kd is just fine, but they are not the only ones. killzone, halo, and battlefield (on team deathmatch mode at least) are just as guilty. this game is brutal, and dying on this game is inevitable, but when you do die you realize how important following procedure and knowing how to react towards a combat situation is. one wrong step and its over. instead of hitting respawn immidiatley after i die, i find myself just stopping and saying damn, maybe if i would of retreated or gone that way, or sent my unit over there, maybe i would still be alive. and then learning from those mistakes. very rewarding and educational experience. a+",3
"awesome game, makes a lot fun when you play the altis life or the wasteland mod of it with your friends.",1
"awesome sandbox game and the modding possibilities! having a blast with altis life mod atm, try it out, best game until dayz sa gets in beta.",1
"revised my review as my last one it was only in alpha, but things have only got better. the possibilitys with this game are almost endless, the multiplayer is by far the most, enjoyable i have played. with so many different game modes, and mods available, you can never get bored. play with your friends and the fun just multiplies. dont get me wrong it has its problems, bugs are still there, and altis can be annoying at times with its lack of cover, but it is a real island, and if they strayed away and changed it, then i wouldnt be altis. the best thing with this game tho is its realism, when one bullet can take you down, and end your day. it adds a fear factor into the game play, where you seek real cover, use real line of sights, and have to make corrections for the ballistics of the weapons. its not for everyone. but any hardcore sim gamer will love this, its still has the arma feel to it, which was something i first thought it would loose. play it. for me, its a 9/10.",9
"if youre like myself and enjoy a fully immersive and realistic experience in a fps, then youll enjoy arma 3. also, while youre at it, try it with the playerunknowns battle royale mod for true heart palpitating intensity!",2
"a simple review will not give just to how good arma3 is. i can write a thousand word review about the scales of battle, weapons, vehicles or the simple yet briliant feature of your character changing stances but a 10min video will convey a much better message with stunning visuals. definetly watch a gameplay video and make sure to check out one that demonstrates the way you can change your stances. i highly recommend getting arma3 and for me is a big improvement on arma2.",2
"great military simulator kind of game! amazing multiplayer!!!",1
"this game is the closest thing youll ever get to the real modern war! realistic to the max! you also need a powerful pc (like mine) in order to handle all the details in this game from the small leaves that fall off the trees as you shoot through them to pierce your enemy, to the small fishes that swim away as you approach your enemys flank. this game is not easy to get the hang of, there is no rushing, no killstreaks, and especially no 12 year olds screaming for kills. this game makes a good use of your keyboard, thank you steam for making this game exclusive to pc gamers.",1
"realistic, hardcore battle simulator. not for the easily bored. a+",1
"i purchased the game and now i have to pay for it again, wth steam, especially you gabe newell.",1
"if you are creative and enjoying creating your own missions and playing with your friends you will like this game. the community has made some great mods for this game also.",9
"arma 3 is possibly one of the best military simulation games i have ever experienced. pros: - wide variety of gamemodes - friendly and (mostly) mature communities - multiplayer allows some crazy fun times with as many friends as you can get together - performance is quite good for most instances (see cons for exceptions) cons: - performance in big cities with a lot of players suffers heavily - physics can be a bit derpy in some instances, and result in death - desync! do some research on it, however it is an arma thing - your social life will slowly fade away when you play this game overall: i would easily recommend this game to sandbox/shooter game lovers.",3
"arma 3 is as real as it gets in military simulation. i would rank the 3 main military simulator games like this; cod < battlefield < arma. i have played the arma series since arma 2 and i can say that this game requires more use of strategy and skill rather than the other two games listed above. it is not about shoot em up, get points, and level up. it is more like use your advantages and strategy against the enemy to push back or eliminate them. its about teamwork and large amounts of skill to win the mission. there are 2 huge islands in the game with tons of bases and towns on each. there are lots of mods and the multiplayer is fun when you find a good lobby. (i mostly play battle royale and annex). the single player is fun and long and the graphics are amazing if you have a good pc to run them. there are not as many vehicles in this than arma 2, but there are still a lot. the workshop makes getting add-ons a breeze. if i were to give a rating for this game i would give it a 9/10, with the -1 being around half the multiplayer lobbies having near empty or no people in them most of the time. other than that this game is a great buy for people looking for hardcore military simulators.",1
"this game allows you to experience realistic combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox.",1
"very good game, just the server listing takes a long time.",1
"cool looking game but way too many issues still. enemy ai is still ridiculous. even the pistol still doesnt show up in the holster, yet they are releasing dlc. overall its ok but not really worth the current price.",2
"i dont really like the vanilla game, also the old arma ii missions like domination 2 and insurgency are terrible. but when you play in an experienced group with a few hundred mods. its freaking awesome. vanilla i dont like the gameplay and their are only a few weapons. but with some mods this game has no limits. try to find a group or clan who makes their own missions and you will have an amazing time. if not, good luck with the single player.",2
"very fun game, physics are an improvement. altis life is one of the finest in game add-ons in history.",3
"not really serious about playing this, got it for just $10 in a sale & only really play it for the graphics. very demanding game really need to get into it more.",1
"this game is amazing my first pc love it has everything, a great community, great mods, great servers with limited hackers. only issue being the gliches you run into great fun for many hours on multiplayer",9
"omg is this real life? it has got to be the best military sandbox i ever seen. so realistic having a blast with it.",1
"great game! tons of gamemodes and tons of things to do. the campaign is awesome along with the multiplayer. i would reccomend this game! 10/10",1
"this game was made to be a fun simulator of war and how the police can be corrupt 10/10",1
"simply amazing!!! so many mods etc with steam workshop, and breaking point............my god!!! bye dayz",2
"got banned for calling someone, who had no life and were just chilling at the noobtown, son of a  on an altis life server. no admins are able to understand fun. 10/10 would definitly recommend",1
"i highly recommend arma 3 if youre into army games with a (high) sense of realism. you can make this game as awesome as you want yourself. depending on which (modded) gamemodes you play or with who youre playing. im part of one of the largest arma 3 clans out there (joint task force 2) and it really adds to the experience, having a tactical realism based clan. think of stuff like basic training, military rank structure, working with a chain of command, teamplay based on military tactics and manoeuvers etc. check us out over at",6
"so i played this game when it was free for 3 days and i only played it for a little while. first of all the game was not very well optimized and i found it to be pretty laggy especially in multilipayer with around 50 people playing and bullets and missles going everywhere. i thought that this was a really releastic game becuase of just how many people there are in a game and how its like a big fire fight. i would have to say for people who have lots of money to spend on games, go ahead and buy it if you have a gaming machiene that can handle this game and get playable frame rates. (recommend an $1000 pc minimum) but if you play free games like me and dont have an extreme pc build i dont really recommend the game that much.",1
"ive never had as much fun as i have had in this game, i can run around the battlefield in just underwear! altis life is also anothing thing that is awesome. i would recommend this game 10 out of 10 times",3
"playing this by yourself and not working together with others this game is quite boring but if you have friends to play with all kinds of fun can be had good game not great but good",2
"numer one military simulator game. the vast amount of scale and realism is incomparable. a great addition to arma series, and definitely worth the money.",3
"this game is a massive improvement to the series. both the visuals and the gameplay have received a complete makeover, while still being very recognisable to anyone familiar with the arma series. especially cqb is more fun now, with the reworked controls, stances and ballistics (barrier penetration). vehicles also received some attention, now with realstic physics. another nice addition is the underwater gameplay, it adds a whole new dimension to the game. contrary to its predecessors, the campaign has a very good storyline and is more immersive. at this moment, theres still less third party content available than for arma 2, but im sure this will improve over time.",2
"are you thinking about biuying this ?? keep reading!! i have been playing military simulators since operation flashpoint, and i`m really in love with the arma series and in my honest opinion there is nothing out there better. if you like a more arcadeish experience just get cod, however if you`re into your realism not kids games, get this!! did you like arma 2 ? then this game is that but better, you got rag doll physics and more life like animations, the modify shooting postions is groundbreaking imho and was a massive upgrade compared to previous installments. yes this game has bugs, but the game covers them up beautifully imho.",1
"it was the only game i played till i had 140hrs on it. o.o",4
"arma 3 has a lot of detail when it comes to its graphics which is good but it can also have some bad points, although it is realistic half the time you cant see your enemies because the sun is in your way. a massive problem with arma 3 is the ai, they are totally un-realistic i once used a sniper to shoot at an ai who took cover on the ground and as it was long distance i missed using a sniper, he stood up and returned fire hitting me with about 3 of his 4 shots. at the distance he shot at it would be impossible with an assault rifle. ive never really found arma as a game i would play by myself because it becomes boring and repetitive especially when you keep dying and most of the game consists of travelling to the battle. i like arma 3 and i would suggest it to everbody because you can have some good times on it. but the game itself needs to have a lot of work for it to be a game i would consistantly play.",1
"it is arma, it is not for anyone, but it is an experience unlike any other",1
"i really enjoyed this game but i mostly enjoyed the multiplayer! everything about this game is just great but i would say its a bit overpriced! the community is amazing not like gmod which is filled with kids! 9/10",1
"another arma 3 game .......... already a good game",1
"arma3 together with ace/acre and more content (from a2) will be the perfect game",1
"good game overall, brillant first/third person military sim/shooter, modding and a pretty good variety of things to do, not to mention the zeus mode so you can troll your friends or just mess around. great game 10/10",1
"its a pretty good game, if you can get past its many bugs and dsync issues",7
"arma 3 is an amazing military sim, with lots of different gamemodes so the game never gets boring. very fun to join up with your friends, recomend sandbox mode, altis life, and king of the hill. i heard battleroyal is really fun but never got to play it yet, if your looking for an intense shooter i recomend purchasing this game even at the 60$ price point!!!",2
"i hated this game at first, i was not a big fan of arma it was so overwhelming. i finally sat down to give it a good ty and i have to say this gaem looks awesome and plays awesome. buy it.",3
"was awsome game. was. thats the big word everytime i go to launch the game now it says initializing then crashes had this for couple months now no support at all from bistudios or any resolved solution from other forums it it worked more often i would recommend it",1
"i am yet to find a more realistic shooter on the market, this game offers tremendous entertainment. conduct multiplayer operations online or with friends, or play special operations missions in the singleplayer mode with massive upgrades from the previous installment of the series. i dont recomend the game, buy it. now.",2
"this is the best game ever! there is so much to do cant go wrong with this buy.",7
"ing real war.... it cant be controlled from mause and keyboard!!!",1
"got sniped and tea bagged 15/10 would bang over a dirty table.",1
"a vast improvement over arma 2, well worth the time to try it out for yourself.",1
"this is a really fun game, if you liked arma 2 you will enjoy thing game a lot =p",1
"sucks s**t if you dont have more than 5 frineds to play with",2
"this game is amazing. while the campaign is not what you should by the game for multiplayer modes are the greatest thing you can play. modes like wasteland and altis life are great. if you have to buy one game this should be it.",2
"really im not sure how i feel about this game. when its fun its a blast.... when its not fun youre wandering across the countryside alone with nothing to do. like other similar games things can go from notmalto chaotic in seconds and some great things happen. in those moments this game really shines. other times its boring as hell.",1
"quite possibly the best fps experience out there, multiplayer wise, story i wasnt to fond of. for me there isnt a game that comes close to the real deal  as this one does. very very fun. cod and even battlefield players be warned this game isnt a run and gun in multiplayer, it requires teamwork so long as your teammates are not shooting you in the head just to steal your startup cash, it is a very communication teamwork based. yes you can go it alone but your chances of being surviving and objective or mission in multiplayer dwindle without someone making sure your not gonna get sniped as you go in assuming you dont get killed by the npcs at that objective. i like how you have to set your range on most medium to long ranged rifle scopes and damn near all vehicle guns/cannons etc. im telling you now i cant explain this game all in one review just buy it theres nothing more to say other than your crazy if you dont. it is a bit demanding for hardware but if you have nvidia card 660ti or above and have the geforce experince and let it optimize the game for you i find that i can get 45-55 fps. correct me if im wrong others in the community but im pretty sure this game will support 4k.",10
"get this game! also if you want to get a game that is like altas life/ gta/ payday/ sims then help get this game started!!!!!!! identity",3
"amazing game for role play and so many different things too!",1
"overall, the game is good, but has a few bugs, including the one mission - death valley - where it makes it nearly impossible to complete, even on the easiest difficulty.",1
"so not a fan of the 2035 setting, but the changes they made to arma are great. this game is a pc crusher and requires only the best to play it though. military realism cant be found at this level anywhere else.",3
"very fun game to play. definitely recommend to everyone.",1
"so many mods to play for every type of playstyle, they really nailed it with this game. you dont see many modable games these dayz.",4
"got some friends. made a badass group named the orphanage. once teamed up with the sock rebellion. meet people and make them orphans. robbed the federal reserve. took over a town. this all happened in the afternoon. #noragrets",2
"it is like real war with slightly worse fps in multiplayer.",2
"a super polished arma 2 with lots of new features that can only get better.",1
"this game is a lot of fun to play with a friend. especially altis life, and wasteland. i had just spawned in on wasteland and there was this guy so i shot him and he apparently had a helicopter with him so i took it and flew off. while i was flying around in a blackhawk heli. a jet comes and starts swarming me and trying to kill me so i land the heli somewhere almost explode cuz of mah mad skillz. and got in a car and was sniped out from the back of the car and died from a guy named jake from 3000 meters off into the distance. and rage moded for an hour. cuz im pro. get this game. it is a heck of a lot of fun.",1
"wish it wasnt as expensive cant wait fo thwe summer sale",1
"ai engine is superb great to play against ai that have intellegence and work together the map and game types are great both online and single player the weapons have been designed and work well the vehicles are great too. would reccomend this game very highly",4
"i couldnt figure out how to open my parachute and so i died.",1
"only get this game if you have a good computer i havve a decent computer and play the game on the lowest settings and get an average 20 fps but besides that this is a fun game theres gamemodes like battle royale whichis hunger games with guns life servers which is rp but you have to be 16 or older to be a cop or play half of those life servers looking at you arma 3 life there also is a story mode for you to practice with the complicated controls like almost the whole format should be rebinded and tweaked by you but im used to them and can go about playing in these servers with my 20 fps",1
"if you like military shooters and realism, this is your game. only complaint is the mp as its not overly optimized at the moment.",2
"felt like it could have been a very good simulator, but it turned out to be poor. played through the first part of the campaign and it was laggy in parts (which i have researched is down to poor optimization of the game) and i managed to get the vehicle stuck in a barrier and had to reload from an autosave. clearly, not well made. i also found the way markers really hard to see. either dont bother with them, or make them more vivid. i also found it hard to see the enemy, but thats just something i would need to get used to. to top it all off, the landscape is so boring. nothing but open areas and very little variation or cover. overall, great potential and if you like spending hours learning to play a more difficult game than cod/battlefield, then ive read that arma 2 is a much better choice. with that being the case, i cannot recommend this game to anyone.",1
"even though i have the crapest laptop soon ill get a gaming pc i love this game i get 15 to 19 fps and so what i still enjoyed playing atlas life,the campaing and other servers.i also like to watch psi syndicate,frankieonpcin1080p and i think lyric plas arma 3 but i love watching them play.if you have a very good p then your in luck for this game i recommend the game to hardcore fps fans out there (with good pcs).",1
"military simulator which achieves so much, whether it be the single player modes or one of the extensive multiplayer modes, this game will keep you hooked.",2
"i reccomend the game but the ing launcher is broken i cant get any of my mods to work it said they were all updated yesterday and now it says there not updated and the mods that are updated say not ready on them which is ing  since ive been using them since theyve updated",3
"arma 3 was a huge upgrade from arma 2. the graphics engine, and introduction of physx on vehicles just blew my mind. i was a bit unhappy due to the lack of vehicles when compared to arma 2, however... the rest was absolutely brilliant.",3
"great, immersive shooter! do not recommend for call of duty players, it is nothing like cod!",2
"ok, lets face the facts, this game is quite a bit of money, but it is totaly worth it.",3
"one of the most expanded game ever made. every aspect of the physics is independent and gives stunning effects. + feeling of shooting + precisely made weapons + precisly constructed wehicles + movement + stances + challenging + lot of mods + almost every aspect of the game + you can fall in love in it - or you can hate it - some bugs - too hard for some people",1
"good game iwth weapon resting mod. i got aids and lived to tel l this tale,",6
"even though i could only play for a couple days it was a really good game. 9.5/10",1
"i dont even own this game but i can write a review so ive got that going for me.",1
"felt clunky. might get it when its cheaper though.",1
"with the new zeus dlc, i honestly think that the future of rts is with this game. if you have the hardware to run the game its a must-buy, its the only pc game out there thats actually a full military simulator rather than run and gun fps.",1
"spawn in to game with two people in front of me. they turn and kill me. 10/10 would be spawn killed again.",2
"this game is hella good you can go from helicopters, jets, boats, submarines, parachutes, on foot... you can do anything that you want freely the choice is up to you. you want too explore you can but... you always must use caution you never know if/when you will be shot at from any direction, any height, any distance and from any type of challenge wether its planes boats, tanks, mines, enemies aka troops and paratroopers you name it.. you can also create missions for you and your friends to play, you can also do anything set on your mind.. but you must follow server rules, if you dont want too be kicked/banned. you can also do solo missions, the campaign, training anything! this game has a ton of mods! so what are you waiting for buy now!!",9
"love the game besides some server lag when you play online",9
"this games brings really fun and is addictive :> great workshop and mods makes this game even better. really worth to buy if you are looking for something to play longer than 1 hour.",4
"this game has its moments and it deserves credit for being a great arma game the engine pretty much aint realistic like arma 2 but this game is pretty fun to play with.",3
"not worth buying it. runs like crap even with better systems as recommandet. sry. bi but u ed it up again and after 2 years now its still a bloody mess...",7
"the greatest and the best military simulator there is. works much better than previous arma 2 installment. comminty offers a large variety of mods, scenarios, missions and hours and hours of online game play. arma 3 needs the player to have a different mindset: this is a simulator, not a traditional fps game!",2
"the best war sim out, great graphics, grab it on sale and you wont regret it.",1
"need plenty of peeps with ya when playing to really enjoy",3
"great game ! its a must buy for everyone who has some time on their hands !",6
"this game man 5/10 just a greedy company that do not care about feedback suck ur life,  communities everywhere,  fps drop in multiplayer, 80% of the server is western site, useless dlc with unreasonable price, 12year-old kid everywhere in america server, good mod that ask for money to play with it, epoch, life. altis life server that force u to donate to get more guns and . its not even called donate, its should be called buy/pay",7
"10/10 game of the year 2015 sadly only 2 maps but still good game thanks you",4
"people that make mods for this game do a better job than the devs. 10/10",5
"they make you buy dlc that holds 2-5 items for 20 dollars game is bad played it like 20 times",2
"very good and realistic game it also gives you a lot of freedom , the whole islands of altis and stratis are yours to explore ... if you are an arma fan you will not be dissapointed by arma 3 , and if you are new to series ,well it makes a great introduction of arma franchise to you ! 5/5",1
"arma iii is by far the best game there is (well until arma iv comes out). it is also probably the most difficult game to play as well. this game is all about tactics and working as a team (something missing from most first person shooters). the game is not about hopping around and making a kill ever 2 seconds like cod etc. the graphics look great and the maps are massive. a lot of games have a wall paper background this game is all 3d (even the clouds are modeled). that hill you see 3 miles away is a location you can travel to. this game does a great job of doing everything. check out the king of the hill rooms on team death match for fun multiplayer action.",4
"this game...... is amazing! i love that you can choose whatever you want to do: go by helicopter and attack a radiotower? no problem! want to be sneaky and work your way arround to assasinate a target? no problem! it just has and so realistic feeling and that makes it super awesome! 10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",1
"solid game. im disappointed they didnt polish it up a bit more before launch, but overall its an enjoyable experience and one that ive put a lot of time into. just make sure your pc can run it smoothly.",2
"this game is awesome !!! gameplay is so good. play tactical !!",6
"once again bohemia has delivered a garbage war simulator with mediocre graphics (in comparison to other war shooters in the industry) and optimization worthy of being related to the original release of crysis 1. im using a gtx780, i53750k (3.4ghz), 16gb ddr (1600mhz) and it ran pitifully. not to mention the voice acting is once again terrible and robotic sounding and the gameplay is awkward and cumbersome with the worst control scheme in the history of shooter games. i get youre going for realism, but at least try and make it accessible. you dont need crap controls to make the world more immersive; you need smoother controls so that you forget youre even playing a game. youre better off reinstalling battlefield 2 and downloading project reality if you really want an immersive war simulator.",1
"fantastic game but oh so many bugs nearly 2 yrs after release",1
"where the arma 2 campaign/s were tedious and frustrating due to bugs and poor ai. arma 3 is one of my favourite campaigns do far. the ai is so smooth, its not 100% predictable and it just flows really well. congratulations bohemia interactive on really stepping up the game with this well...game (excuse the pun)",2
"arma 3, the most universal shooter you might ever need to own. back in the old days, it was half life which everyone had to own, because this piece had plenty of content which you were able to play in so many different ways that its almost impossible to count them all. and arma nower days is pretty much the same, even if youre not a fan of great and realistic combat simulations it offers massive free content via its big community which wont stop generating content until and after the next arma will be released. but be aware this game is a hefty performance eater and it can cause you alot of headache, because of its bugs. but i have no doubt right now, that most of the bugs are wiped out and the rest is still on its way to be fixed. because this game really gets the love of its makers after its final release. theres still an addon to be awaited as well as a very nice dlc and im positively looking forward to it.",8
"simply amazing. the games feels a lot smoother than arma 2.",1
"a wonderfully satisfying pc game,many game-modes, huge maps, plenty vehicles, awesone weapons, ect. definetly worth the $59.99",4
"nothing comes close to a milsim other than arma. flawless.",1
"being a war simulation game (in comparison, battlefield is an arcade game), the community is very mature and respectful. besides, if you are a programmer, you can do a lot with this game.",4
"a masterpiece. with the infinite amount of content, amazing textures and deteals, huge map, fun dlcs, and amazing controls, this game is one of the if not the best games on the market to this date. ive put 72 hours roughly into this game and it still keeps bringing me back for more. between altis life, wasteland, amazing workshop content, and dlcs/campaign there is no stop to the endless things this game has to offer. the team based strategies of wasteland multiplayer are amazing. you find awesome people in team speak and after the server i always find myself adding more and more people to my friends list. with the excitement of finding enemy weapon crate stashes, abandoned helicopters and tanks, a huge fight between opfor and blufor teams, and if your lucky a jet is something that always makes me want to play wasteland 24/7. if you are reading this review and are deciding on wether to buy this game or not, there are many things to take into acount. this game will not be very much fun with a bad/mediocre computer. although the computing power demands of this game are high please buy this game and you will find how fun and exciting everything about this game is. thanks for reading.",1
"besser als der vorgnger, schon in der alpha gefllt mir die allgemeine spielmechanik. die grafik ist schn anzusehen und die bugs sind bei der alpha nunmal nicht anders zu erwarten. trotzdem besser als battlefield 3 und der andere shooter mll. i can already say that i like the alpha from arma 3 more then arma 2 with better game mechanics and beautiful graphics. the bugs arent unusal for an alpha version. but i still prefer arma 3, rather than the rest of the shooter-crap like battlefield 3.",1
"if youre reading this review and not playing arma 3, youve made a very serious mistake.",4
"after update new command code make game really good for me !!!!",1
"this game is very good, but it is hard if you dont have a laptop that can make high graphics. this game look very real. so if you want a game that is like to be in war in the realy world then this game is something for you. i have not have the chance of having the highest but i love how they make this game so real. it is so many things that can happen in this game. it is not like the other shooting games, on this game you have to have a plan all the time. it is many viechles on this game like battleship, jeep, helicopter, tanks, boat and much more. if you have a fast laptop this game is woth it.",1
"the fact that the game was released without a single-player campaign is very off-putting. the graphics are astonishing, though. the intense detail put into every single action that you do really hinders the fun aspect of the game. its more simulation than fps.",1
"very good game with alot of mods that you can play with yourself and friends!",3
"the most realistic army simulator! the graphics are incredible and the added features make it a good game.",2
"this joint off the chain. it looks sexy and i find it satisfying to play. if you liked arma 2, this is much more fluid and streamlined. it takes time to figure out all the keys cus theres so many, but its because of that which gives this game a unique experience of control and realism. now that i think about it moving your head independant of your gun doesnt really do much but it feels baller. on top of all that theres a never ending stream of content on the workshop. theres even a metal gear solid remake.",1
"for me personally arma 3 is the game i love to play te most, weather im attacking a squad and battling in wasteland or fighting for kavala in king of the hill or my personal favorite role playing in altis life theres a community for everyone and this makes arma 3 the game it is. its more than just a war simulator its been made into a game where you can play with friends and still have a relexed fun and enjoyable experience for everyone and for the hardcore shooters out there there is still the intnsity of battle for you guys too! to conclude id strongly reccomend this game and it is seriously worth checking out!",10
"gameplay if fantastic, maps are fantastic, missions are fantastic, wasteland is fantastic, mods are fantastic, rp life sucks. 8.5/10",1
"worst fps ever... battle field is far better than this trash...",1
"game is easily wroth the money, the story mode keeps you on your toes, the online... well what can i say if get tired of one game mode theres lots of other to try, then the workshop add that much more to the game, a great game wroth the buy!",3
"i played this game for 260 hours and it was amazing. i played with friends and then got banned by battleye for no reason...i am very dissapointed in be for global banning me for no reason. i do not cheat and the worst i have done is download mods in which arma 3 has mod support. arma 3 is a overall great game but the sixty dollars is not worth it.",4
"if you want to play a fps/tps game that will test your wits, this would be the game for you.",1
"for some reason i have arma 3 in my games list but it says but it now not play idk what happened",1
"very fun game for people who like military simulator style games. got some bugs, but still worth it.",3
"great game. altislife and wasteland are great for learning the controls in a relaxed environment but jump into something like king of the hill for some real fun.",3
"arma3 is fun to play but i really just bought it to play dayz epoch",1
"great game. need more friends to play for added fun.",2
"this game, epic. if you like war games (and who doesnt like war games?) then this game is perfect for you! currently its in alpha so the map is only 20km^2 large, but the full map will be ~270km^2 large. i personally love this game, its a must play!",3
"after the 523 hr i have played arma 3 i have meet new friends i have joined and made groups and had some epic battles, its an amazing game, every thing is at it best in arma 3, the pyhisics, combat movments, wepons and many more! 10/10",6
"easily one of the best military simulators on the market. if youre a fan of arma 2. youll be a fan of arma 3. although the game has slight optimization issues it overall doesnt effect the game drastically. highly recommended a beefy/above average computer before buying. side note wish the games flight aspects were made more realistic. good military sim recommended. 8.5/10",3
"awsome i been playing on the free weekends its come out i dont see anty thing wrong with it",1
"this is one of the best games that i have ever played. the single player is very dynamic and keeps you interested. the only problem that i have with the game is that when you close out of it and restart the game the graphics are a little wierd and make the game unplayable. this can be fixed by restarting the computer.",1
"aaaahh arma! the best simulator ever made for war games. the sandbox variations for every scenerio either real one that re-crated or your imagination gives the best expirience in this great franchise!",1
"great game to start with it has a pretty good community which i value deerly. the game is pretty realistic, this can be a pain if you get shot and you dont even have a clue were it came from. although its a very good games its a bit of a bummer that the campaign is released in parts, but atleast the developers care enought to not rush the release, this would be worse. overall a good game although its pretty heavy for most systems.",3
"great game, some good missions on the steam workshop to keep this playing.",2
"unrealistic. walked up behind someone unloaded an entire clip of an m4 into them. 25 yards away with them not seeing me or even knowing im in the bush behind him. he turns around and one shot me with a makarov? just very unrealistic on the things that should be real and the things that doesnt matter they focus on.",1
"move the game, very good detail and im in the military and can say its extremely close. wish we had some of the older weapons still like the aks and m16 and othe guns because i bet people will still be using those 30 years from now. but over all it is an amazing game and hope that can keep improving to wow me.",3
"can someone please buy arma 3 as a gift to me please :(???? you see, i am very poor and i just cant afford a game like arma 3. i just love this intense game and it has a wonderful sensation. i wish i could just get my hands on it but i dont have the required amount of mey just yet. im just begging anyone out there that is kind to buy me this game as a gift. it would touch my heart deep inside me ;). im crying now as i type. if anyone out there has a heart that is strong enough to be generous i would highly appreciate it :). most people wont listen but it will be awesome. thankyou!!! ;)",1
"nothing beats playing multiplayer to see a giant exloding rocket peniz flying around in the air.",2
"great game, very demanding though, i have a 780ti and i run the game on very high and get 80fps on sp and 30fps on mp. i recomend you play epoch and king of the hill if you like slow pace tactical gameplay, and altis life if you like role playing! i recomend you wait for the game to go on sale, i waited for it to be 50% off",1
"incredible co-op. good community. best fps game i ever owned.",3
"this game is hours of endless possibilities if you put in what you want to get out. best shooter of my lifetime.",2
"seriously just the battle royale mod for this game is enough that you should buy it.",3
"crashed into a pole, my car exploded....... crash into a car head on going 120kph, i popped a tire.......(other guy died) best physics ever 11/10",5
"game is good. graphics are good. the mods are good. what else could you need?",2
"accidently touched a tree with helicopter and exploded to death. best aircraft killing simulator!",1
"supports the new unreal engine 4 with best bugs ever and flying spazzing cars with rollercoaster effects you have never seen before. yes",6
"this is a super realistic millitary based game. i mean whats not to love?",1
"can recommend but dont expect to play as cod or bf shooter. learning curve is quite long :d",2
"what a fantastic game. well worth the money, buying this is like buying 10 games in one. so much fun to be had and so many mods and different modes to try out. this game looks great and is so fun to play.",1
"a great simulator game after arma 2 i think, its very realistic. i recommend this game for someone that love real war simulator games :d (y) keep it up, bohemia!!",1
"great game! i love realistic fps games like these, and cant recommend it enough! teamwork and tactics are a necessity.",1
"awesome game! you should buy this game if your pc can run it otherwise you will get 20- fps and thats not playable.",4
"very good game ! a must for every gamer buy it now while it is on sale :)",1
"cant go wrong with this game. servers can be buggy at times, but i assure you, its great if you want to get it right now (summer sales) 50% off!!",3
"if you want a good feeling tactical shooter, this game is for you. i love this and have put in countless hours. a mod friendly game and a large community make this a double wammy beauty. 5/5",9
"arma 3 is the best military simulation game ive ever played. it incorporates all elements of warfare into one massive map for the ultimate realistic experience.",10
"just after the recent update 4/8 the fixed wings showcase no longer works, everything spawns in water and your floating -_-",4
"a friend made me buy this game. in thing sucks! prepare to waste hours of your life not having any fun.",1
"i really like this game but can someone please for the love of god fix the issue where i cant use the advanced stances in this game? i mean for a premium so expensive you would think the video game worked properly yet for some reason there is a fairly essential stance  up in the game and thats absurd truthfully. great game, annoying bug. felt like i should have spent less money to get pissed off with a product thats otherwise working great except for where controls are deleted right from the menu.",2
"i have been playing with the arma series since arma 2, and i cna honestly say arma 3 not only vastly improves on amra 2, but it also has the best community in gaming i have ever seen.",10
"i really love this game, but its not well optimised at all,..",1
"boring as hell! arma games are so overated, i played arma 2 and arma 3, both have the same issues, boring gameplay, and optimized like crap! i can play most of the games at 1080p/60fps but this game even on low settings i always got like 20-30fps, thats very sad since this is a pc game only, the game is just not well optimized",1
"this game is far too clunky to even be considered a full game in fact this should be in alpha. the controls are ok but the arma engine just makes it feel unnatural like everything is not smooth at all. the spotting system in this game is totall  by the way. you and your friend could be hiding in deep weeds but if an enemy gets within 50mt from you then you appear on their map, ripe for them to then kill you completing invalidating close up stealth. the game also has hit detection problems, i had the iron sights pointed directly at an enemy a bour 75 mt away and i could see the dust of the bullets hitting behind the enemy. overall i wouldnt get this game for full price, possibly 75% off if you want to play with friends because playing with friends does make the game a little better.",2
"i backed up two feet into a pole and my car exploded",5
"its a good game just needs bette optimzation and some key bugs need to be fixed.",1
"fan-freakin tastic! its all youd want in a wargame, unfourtunately i cannot say the same about the download space. still great game overall.",7
"military simulation at its finest, my own disappointment is the flow of content, other than that the combat mechanics are incredible. there is all kinds of community content that even further improves the game as well.",2
"this game. youre gonna die on a hill becuase your -,  character cant even jog on a damn hill.  that , and  bohemia for this stupid-,  game.  dayz also.",1
"i dont have much of a game time in this game yet, but from what ive played and from what ive seen... its by far one of the best games i have played, its a massive open world army simulation kind of game, youre not being given anything like the enemy being highlighted ect, you have to use your eyes and ears and watch your every step... 8/10 maybe a couple of improvements can be made, but its deffo one of the best games i have played and id reccomend it to anyone with a bit of patience as its not as fast paced like games such as call of duty ect",1
"1/10 this game is very bad, the game is very slow paced and has no kill streaks whatsoever. also the soundtrack is really bad and contains no skrillex or even major lazer. this all adds up to me not being able to show noobs how much of a dominant player i am. do not buy this, put it down and play the new call of duty instead.",2
"a lot better than it was before, luckily for me i bought it when it was in alpha :d",1
"if you are looking for a realistic military sandbox, then look no further than arma 3. from a mission editor that allows the player to create any scenario possible, to an extensive list of community mods and addons, the possiblities are endless. the developers do an amazing job of fixing bugs and fueling all players with new content, and will do so for the next few years for sure! 10/10",4
"arma one of the greatest combat simulators of all time, armed assault may run  on my pc but i wont lie its still fun as hell.",1
"love the realism this game brings to the 1st/3rd person action genre. recommend to anyone looking to step up from battlefield or call of duty.",1
"play altis life mod on this, its absolutely brillian. blackwing gaming",1
"it is an amazing but i would say you need a strong computer to run it",1
"waste of money even the real weapon doesnt move alot when you aim. graphics was good but when you aim its moves around alot dont know what they are trying to prove. even when i fire my m249 machine gune i can zero like in cicle but the weapon inthis game sucks.",1
"soo... i buy the beta at 59.99 but the game is now 35.99... i dont get this...",3
"reality of combat system is just outstanding. in one multiplayer fight i have been crowling with my teammates for 30 minutes to get to the enemy base during the night. we finally did it and with our great communication skills we managed to eliminate enemy team.",1
"10/10 would get stuck in a rock again! in all seriousness this game really puts it all on the table, realistic bullet drop, realistic combat and ai (youll die a lot), expansive maps, team effort, and a fun time. anyone looking for a replacement for combat sims, or shooters need not look further! just watch out for rocks :)",1
"a little bit expensive but worth it in my opinion. the possiblilties are endless.",9
"this game is fantastic if you enjoy games that require you to work as a team to complete objectives. grab some friends jump on a server and let the team building begin. prefer to go solo? well the campaign is absolutley spectacular. still not interested? you can always play with the mods that are always coming out and being updated. in short there is something for everyone.",1
"amazing game 10/10 very realistic stunning graphics and amazing gameplay from playing a mod to koth",8
"great fun but a bit clunky at times, mods for this game make it much better :d",5
"i wish people played more pvp in this game. not altis life but other than that it is a great game",6
"played this game... kinda liked it... kinda liked its mom... 10/10 would recommend.",1
"runs like sh*t dont even try playing multiplayer, it dosent work for shiz nig, refresh is broken, cant join a friends game through steam.",1
"i love hand cuffing people and making them bow down and kiss my feet.",1
"great game for hardcore gamers cant wait for what more is to come in this game",1
"best atmosphere ive ever played in. also quite realistic. thumbs up.",1
"children play call of duty boys play battlefield men play arma",1
"need indian servers !! also its boring to select addons in the game and than restart and if you want to play another mission than again select addons from expansion menu and restart . apart from that epic !!!!!!",3
"i would reccomend, i mostly play altis, king of the hill and i tired to play battle royale (royale with cheese) with no luck. i will try to do so again. its fun, much better than arma 2 in my opinion, some would disagree... each to their own. cars would be better if you could control them better, as well as them not breaking if you tap something. would buy, but only if 50% off like i did in the summertime sale. this game is not worth the full current price of 35.99 or the deluxe version of 39.99. so i suggest waiting for the winter or summer sales. but non the less still a good fun game, even if you are playing alone, if you have friends to play with, im sure its much more fun!",1
"the only difference between this game and real life is the respawn button.",2
"its hard on noobs. it was for me. but as soon as i found out the basics i had so much fun!",1
"the only fps that allows you to run straight and look left and right! thumbs up! i downloaded arma 3 to play the breaking point and epoch mods. both are great! highlly recommend!",9
"best army simulation in entire time then ill play games...wery nice work :)",4
"amazingly well done game. awesome mods, no bugs, running smooth even on week pcs. i recommend this game for everybody",9
"less aircraft than arma 2=cost more$$ 11/10 would recomment my family and friend to buy this game for christmas",3
"the game is awesome. needs alot more mods though. arma 2 has a better mod selection. comon people make some mods!",2
"very first minutes: oh god oh god who shot me who shot me ?! 30 mins. later: i see you but i wont shoot you because i cant. 60 mins. later: ing campers ing campers ! 1 months later: sitrep grind 061357, enemy 200 metres r.u.a",1
"totally worth the try since alpha phase if you are into tactical shooters.",1
"i mean i havent seen any zombies but its a pretty ok game",1
"this games definetly for people who like to be imaginative in the military action category. i like the tactical mechanics but i wish theyd change the fighting style of infantry when your a group leader. that problem makes the combat a little slow. other than that i am now in love with arma in general. the gameplay is a whole lot more fun than all these brand new fpss and it really throws you into the battle and isnt just point and shoot but brings it to a whole new playing level, making it feel that much more real. i have to say what makes the games a million times better is the modding community. there is never a single day where i am bored of playing this game, other than my inexperience with scripting in the editor, making it hard to look around and find solutions to my problems. i would seriously recommend this game for someone looking to have fun, sharpen their senses, or both.",6
"10/10 would sell csgo skins for this game side note : npcs have aimbot on lowest difficulty (on singleplayer) , but the end result is worth it",1
"amazing game, totally worth getting graphics 10/10 multiplayer 10/10 campaign not finished/10 dayz,altislife,wasteland etc mods 10/10",1
"its is a good and amazing sim and you should all have the chance to play it you will love it.",1
"so much opportunity in this game. mods being produced every day with a lot on the horizon. definite purchase for anyone interested in milsim, fps, and rpg.",5
"didnt bring much to the table in my own opinion, but the addition of more modern controls and the addition of newer smoother animations makes it a nice upgrade from arma 2",1
"wish i could get a refund, it crashes everytime i try to play. even after following guides to fix all the problems, i even factory reset my computer twice and asked support for help. yet, nothing. gg. maybe stop breaking the game with every update, itd be nice.",3
"tried to do a backflip in a helicopter, didnt press z whilst upside down... i died. 99/11",1
"still getting black screen on a quad core with dual cards that runs bf4 and arma 3 in ultra with no issues. awesome job, really.",1
"if you liked operation flashpoint, this game can at least catch up",1
"if you want to play a heavy realistic and enyoing game, then i clearly recommend you to play this! the gameplay itself has its own spirit that makes the arma franchise unique. the in-game controls may be a little but confusing but you get used to it. clearly recommended to play this with friends, and the gamemodes are awesome. there is altis life wich is a roleplaying gamemode, wasteland wich is like dayz with no zombies innit. and ofcourse there is tons of mods in the internet so i suggest you give arma 3 a try. :)",1
"brandon is silly for not buying this game. its a fun game. you can go diving, who doesnt want to go diving.",3
"ive been waiting for a game like this my whole life without even knowning it. quite possibly the best shooting game ever made.",2
"such a great game! im thoroughly enjoying the campaign at the moment but i love the different multiplayer scenarios and stuff, 10/10!",2
"cant say enough good about this game, so much more fun than the run and gun games. i enjoy making missions and playing them with my friends, the mod community has to be one of the best ever... other than some bugs here and there which i know the game is constantly being improved upon makes it one of my favorites, if you are tired of the generic run and gun shooters and want a game that actually makes you have to think , ammo count, health, team members, this is the one. i got tired of the others. (wont mention their names ) they kept tweeking them and wrecked the games for me. so you could say i got tweeked right out of them. i am a little over a half century old and have been gaming for many many years. the operation flash point days were a blast, and to see this evolve into what it is today is just great. if i could add anything to this game, it would be the ability to jump, and maybe a flame thrower tank. and the ability to put c4 on a small drone :) i recommend this game for fun",4
"fun game, though the combat system takes time getting used to.",1
"if i there was a thumbs up, thumbs down. id give it that, i sunk just about 8 hours into it. dont get me wrong, i quite like this game, the graphics, gameplay, control of the charecters are fantastic. but there are some things id like to go through: 1) ai: this is a major problem which will ruin the game, to kill an enemy, its about 4-5 shots the ai however (even on recruit, can kill you in 1-2 shots from distances at 500m from a standard assault rifle, it ruins the game completely. you cannot complete the game without dying 10+ times. this needs to be fixed, especially on the mission which are on your own. on multiplayer however,(co-op) ai is laggy and derpy at times, and are still op. 2) controls are hard to get used to, they are everywhere, num pad, f keys, behind your back etc. if you cant remember a binding, or get a control wrong, it could cost a mission faliure, there a bit clunky at times. 3) price: 35.99 (i got it for 17.99) in my opinion, a bit overpriced for what you get... but still is a very good game in conclusion, arma 3 is a great game but still needs work with ai overall i will give it 7/10",1
"played king of the hill stole helicopter everyone entered helicopter i tried to fly helicopter i crash helicopter into spawn got abuse in chat 10/10 would get called  pilot again.",1
"i have this game on my other account and its amazing :d",1
"i bought it on sale. its a little cluncky, but i am actually rather enjoying some of the custom missions and mods. so buy it for the mods, rather than the campaign and youre all good",3
"great game it is addictive and there are lots of great community made mods to play with when you and they range from the interesting to the rididulous. highly recommended",8
"this game shouldnt have been released yet. deadlines kill games. i love this franchise but this game is a big, steaming, pile of poop. i dont recommend it as of now....this game isnt worth 10 bucks and they are still trying to scam people out of their 60 bucks! for 60 bucks i want a perfect game in the aspect of no bugs. this game is full of them. it seems every update that comes out makes the game worse, not better. the devs care about the money not the game. the same bugs are there since the alpha release... save your money on this pile of garbage.",1
"arma 3 is one of my top 5 favourite games, it has 2 massives maps to play on. and millions of mod like breaking point, arma 3 life, battle royal and many more. overall this game is massively awesome so why not try it out?",2
"wanna play a war simulator? arma 3 is the best! play with friends and have fun!",3
"so many things to do, like making your own missions in editor and playing them with other people. also, hours of time looking through mod sites and downloading anything remotely cool is fun too",2
"i like it and most of the times playing life mods. there are so many mods which you can play the will be always one fitting your needs and wishes. my favorite is rp life mods and i can still enjoy playing them. it has several single player missions which can help to get used to the game. as well there are several military mods, life mods, fun mods out there. i recommend this game.",3
"i really like this game. tons of fun , a lot of mods wich my favorites are altis life and wasteland. you can spend hours of gameplay non stop laughing (depends on the mod you are playing) and tons of different weapons , vehicles. ill give it 8/10 only because not every person can play this game its really heavy and the other down side is you need to learn the keybinds because there is a lot of them. love this game. <3",1
"cant play more than 5 minutes without a dxgi_device_removed_error displaying, a problem that is shared by many users. there is no clear solution to the problem on any forum and bohemia have basically said it isnt their problem. i have tried everything from re-installing to rolling back drivers, updating and lowering graphics. be very wary, i spent 39.99 on it and due to steams policy, i wont be getting it back!",1
"kinda like warcraft 3 no one buys it for the actual game its all about the mods.",1
"the only game people never gave a f*** about its netcode even if its far worse than bf4s netcode. 10/10",1
"awesome game needs some work on the scripting side of things",10
"the only thing you need to know about playing arma 3 is that no matter what you do the game plays like . all arma games play like , it is a physics law. whether you have a i7 with sli 780s or a 8350 with xfired 7970s, this games your fps will change more than peoples opinions on ben affleck being batman. pros: workshop +++ replayability open map (a little empty though) engaging campaign (so far) intelligent difficulty (unlike arma 2) cons: the game engine need for tweaking for a remotely solid 60fps stupid animations the inventory system the designers made stupid choices on vegetation popping again rather then building a sound game. final comments: i love arma 3.... but i believe if someone made a bot filled giant cti mod for just cause 2. then i have no need to play arma at all.",1
"if you want a good game to roleplay in get this game, it has the altis life mode which is like gta online on steriods but with real roleplay and jobs. 10/10.",1
"best military simulation game ever made, since ghost recon",3
"first play session, join a random multiplayer server called altis life or something. get kidnapped by some form of terrorist group, they take me to an island and tell me to hide in a house, the police come and save me, they give me a car to go back to a town, have the car confiscated by the cops that helped me due to speeding, run for about an hour to the nearest town, get killed by a guy in his underwear and a fedora screaming about being mlg, leave game. 11/10 would play again!",2
"great game, a must have for fans of fps games. there are so many different things you can do with this game.",5
"a solid upgrade from its predecessor (arma 2), the new movement system is outstanding and a really great edition to the game, the new engine really brings the maps to life, espically at night time, more enterable buildings then ever before makes for better gameplay and more care taken when clearing towns/buildings, once the mods that made a2 so great come across and get upgraded this game will be complete, bis add a bipod for christ sake!",3
"great game for the person that is looking for a more realistic game setting, just beware of the hackers.",6
"absolutly amazing army simulator, great with friends if you wanna try something tactical. great game and love the custom maps which people make. very high quality and considered and can keep for entertained forever! great game. 9/10 con: the only con i have is the ai is very skilled when it comes to where you are, they know very much. but thats the only downside i have.",1
"this is by far my favorite sandbox game. the base game itself is very good and the multiplayer is a ton of fun (though servers do need to be restarted like every 4 hours of the multiplayer lag gets out of hand). i would not reccomend this game if you have a lower end to mid end machine as this games graphics will destroy your machine. buy this game.",5
"armas control system is more complicated than a woman. and i seem to spend more time arguing with it than i do my wife. having said that, its a beautiful game with lots of potential fun, but seriously, why is it so hard to change how i look down my scope? stupid bloody overcomplicated control system...grump.",1
"great game, have a pretty  laptop but suprizingly i lag on arma 2 and dayz standalone, but i can run this at 50 fps, i brought it in sale for $40 next day, down to $30, wtf steam! could of spent the extra $10 on a months subscription on brazzers.. -_-",1
"you think this is a tactical 1st person/3rd person military simulator but actually its a running simulator, where you spend 90% of the time sprinting while looking for enemies, 5% of the time in a vehicle that you managed to find, 4% of the time shooting at black dots 300m away you assume are people, and 1% of the time actually killing a person im exaggerating of course, but still you spend a lot of time running in the middle of nowhere",1
"i must say this is simply the best shooter out there with so many user created contents like sandbox environment, persistent player stats apart from the normal pvp and co-op game mode. arma 3 is much more optimised than the prior version. best immersive gaming experience like you felt when first time played ops flashpoint: cold war crisis.",1
"excellent game if you have a half decent pc. people whinge about not much content but i found there is plenty for everything that i need and i believe most people need. if more content is needed, there are plenty to choose from. some of the mods such as breaking point (a zombie game on altis) are far superior to the dayz sa and most dayz for arma mods without the building as yet. i am sure that sa will get better but with patches few and far between it will take some time. arma 3 multiplayer is also very enjoyable with some mates and a few beers. certainly worth it if your into a bit of realism compared to other aa or aaa titles. be patient with the game, the end result is awesome all around.",8
"i have changed this to a positive review as originally i was very dissapointed with the vanilla of this, only with weapon mods and a3l will you have a fun experiance witht his game",6
"such a great game, espescially online, if you love the realism in games then youre going to love this futuristic military game, even though you might need a good pc, the fun is still unbearable",2
"the best milsim around. however, you need to have a very good pc with intel hardware to fully enjoy arma3.",3
"this game is amazing. no other game can compete. the amount of things you can do is outstanding from playing on a tatical server to just having fun with frends on a closed server. looks amazing, plays well and they keep on adding stuff! 10/10.",2
"played it for some time when it was free best game eva if ya have the muneyz buy this! :) it has allot of mods to so :*",1
"amazing graphics, realistic and fun what else to say apart from 10/10 :)",6
"i was playing an rp mode called altis life. me and a friend decided to do some heroin runs to make some easy money. we spent all of our money on trucks and supplies needed to collect heroin we went to the field, picked as much heroin as we could hold and went back to process it. on the way home we saw an unoccupied offroad on the side of the road. my friend drove past it and it blew us up randomly. 10/10 would do it again",4
"i recommend this game only if my brother, tommy plays it. :)",1
"ive only played this in wasteland but i would say it is amazing.",1
"a really fun game, dont play the singel, its fun and all but try to get in a clan, that way you have the most fun (in tactical missions). other then that, there are a lot of fun mods like breaking point, battle royale and wasteland that are really fun. a really good game :d",1
"i got shot and waited for a medic, in that time i took a crap and got a drink. still waiting. 10/10 would crap again",1
"the best shooter,tactic game i ever played i also love the editor to",4
"i pre-purchased this game before it even came out and here i am nearly two years later and this game is just terrible... arma 2: oa is much better. arma 3 is not terrible neccesarily becuase of the gameplay, i want to add its terrible becuase it just runs absolutly horrible on my computer for some reason i have no idea why... i can never get above 25 fps.... i have an amd fx cpu (8 cores @ 4.0 ghz) and an nvidia gtx 770 gpu... why does this game run so horribly bad?? dont tell me its cause i have an amd processor because that is not a valid excuse. even 2 years later this game is $60 and another $16 if you want two extra helicopters? its ridiculous! this game had potential to be a great successor to arma 2 but it just falls so short it isnt as fun, its runs terribly so i just cannot recomment it to anyone. another side note, i dont know if this is because of the low quality settings i have to use...but, the sky always seems like it is soo bright and washes out detials so bad arma 3 just look terrible. im so very disapointed in this game.",1
"very tactical, strategy, ive enjoyed this game way too much, i recommend it. youll have way too much fun if you bring friends.",5
"maybe good for mods, but campain looks . maybe not campain itself but ai. ive finished 6 missions so far and all time ive been running behind ai as they never get tired.. then you have  aim etc etc etc. also i hate super duper talks like copy that and other bla-bla. too much of non-sense in simple situations. movement is good",1
"one of the best shooters being released this year.",4
"very good game with endless possibilities as well as mods but lacks good optimization. youll need a very good cpu as well as gpu to run this game on ultra with a stable 60 fps.",4
"this game is to fun i cant believe they put this much time on this game. i wonder if their going to make arma 4",1
"amazing game with a huge community behind it. new mods all the time to add new flair to the game. mods soch as breaking point, king of the hill, and acre radios, and more. all this gives into a game that ever changing and once its paid for, all content is free",6
"im going to make my review as short as possible. arm is a monster of a game, and a damn good one to. if you are not willing to put time into the controls and gameplay you will be bored and frustrated quickly. from what i have found, the community is very mature, the servers are good and the gameplay is suspenseful. we have not seen any game like this in a long time, there is an insane amount of content, the graphics are amazing, and the feeling is absolutely pinpoint what it is meant to be. i coudnt recomend this more to the people who are interested in the idea 9/10",1
"it might not be as good as arma 2 in my opinion but its still great!",1
"awesome sandbox military sim. veterans will appreciate the realism.",1
"arma is my go to game now, i love playing all the modes like altis life and battle royale. the game is a giant sandbox and is a ton of fun to play. i am trying to find a realism unit to play with because that looks like a lot of fun! i easily reccomend this game to anyone, a bit of a learning curve at first but its worth it. if you dont want to pay full price its totally worth it in a sale! after joining a military sim unit i feel like i am actually reaching this games full potential it is a lot of fun!i if you pick up this game look at joining a realism unit.",2
"not only is arma 3 a great military simulator without mods,with mods you will find yourself lost in the fun of all the mods have to offer.the mods include jumping out of planes to fight against other people,surviving in a world where you have to scavenge for equipment and weapons,and trying to escape an island while the island sinks and meteors crash all around you.all in all this game is a great game that you can enjoy alone or with friends. 11/10 would snipe again!",2
"the best military game ever. fairly realistic, all sorts of vehicles playable, huge map, lots of community addons and mods. this is the number one game that i love.",1
"initially, i bought this game because i wanted to play wasteland or something coming from arma 2. this was back in alpha. it sucked , and i left the game to collect dust for a long time, then one day when it finally got released, a whole new gaming experience overwhelmed me! completely swept me off my feet with the mechanics that this game has to offer, and due to one of the latest updates being zeus it has made gaming to a whole new level. since becomming a fan of the arma 3 i now own 2 servers for a community named stdelta. its the most fun you could have with a war simulator you could ever have your hands on. would definately reccomend this game to any gamers looking for a challenge in their gaming. live long and drop the the floor and do the dinosaur. ~hash",6
"the best and most realistic military simulator thus far! i wold recommend this game to anyone who likes military games and simulators like arma 2 and this.",2
"if you have friends that have the game then yes you should buy it. it is also a fun game to play by yourself. arma iii is an all around game that if you are willing to buy and enjoy it, you will love it!",1
"arma 3 is not as complicated as people make it out to be. after throwing myself into over 50 hours of multiplayer co-op missions, let me tell you this game is way more fun that i ever thought it would be. some missions involving infantry, tanks, aircraft, and artillery are staggering beautiful no matter if the server has 12 or 60 people on it. the only thing getting in the way of this game being perfect is the ui. a strange scroll wheel system to select weapons and execute user actions is something that is not only difficult to learn but doesnt work very well even once you do. minding the small learning curve (mostly due to the ui as stated above), this game is absolutely fanatastic and you shouldnt be afraid of the realism presented- it just makes it all the more fun.",3
"this game is amazing i have seen gamplay i would recemend it to eny one that likes war games. this game is nice to play with friends. if i could get the money i would buy this but i dont have eny :( sadly",1
"hey guys if your looking t get this game ite real fun ive had agreattime the devs did a really good.. you should totslyy buy it. if you get it ctslk to me i need people to talk to",1
"i love this game!!! its a very tactical, strategic and realistic shooter with tons of replay value.",2
"fun, great community, plenty of mods to keep you entertained but this game is expensive, its a stretch whether its worth 60$ imo but its very fun would buy again if it got cheaper",1
"probably one of the most complex games i have ever played but i always want to keep playing it.",1
"well... this is the best war game out here i play battlefield cod but this is simply amazing!!! this is a war game where you can do anything!! its like gta and battlefield @ the same time lol love it",2
"really fun i dont much care for the corrupt cops on altis life or the people using mortars in wasteland or the idiots who play domination but its a fun game anyway but it sucks i bought it the day before it went on sale...",1
"if you like military shooters and realism, this is your game. only complaint is the mp as its not overly optimized at the moment.",2
"love it or hate it, but you wont be on the fence about it. i love it and if i had time it would swallow my life whole. (un?)fortunately theres another (none) game out there that can do the same; rocksmith 2014 and i cant put that one down either so at tqeh moment rs2014 is winning out, but i have no doubt i will return to arma 3 and loose a whole other chunk of my life!!!",1
"recommend buying there is alot of gamemodes you can play. its like 1 game that includes thousands of games. its really fun. and the marksman dlc is really fun to play around with.",3
"welcome to the future, where 30 years from now current weapons and equipment such as the matv,fennik,iwi tavor and negev,cheytac .408,m14 ebr,merkava battle tank and littlebird will still be in use with different names and no real world upcoming technologies such as power armor,airburst launchers, vtol aircraft, and infantry hud will have any presence on the battlefield what so ever. also weapons cancelled years ago such as the commanche helicopter will be readopted generations later and renamed to avoid copyright issues. enjoy a convulted control set up where in the heat of battle you will enter the steam control panel,trying to set a machinegun to auto fire will reset to semi when entering a truck or changing weapons or enjoy running over a chicken wire fence with a multi-ton truck will disable it to a halt. also enjoy advertisements in game to buy over priced dlc if you move near some of the helicopters that cost 16 usd when the devs got drunk and thought they were devs programing pay content for world of tanks or warthunder. dont buy unless you want to play the userbase made game modes suxh as wasteland,king of the hill, or breaking point, the only thing worth playing with this software.",4
"good game, played it for the free weekend. nek minute i put my cd key in and i had to reinstall the whole game... 10/10",2
"the best war simulator game that i have ever seen, arma 3 is a simulator game that has series and dlcs all around this game. i recommend buying this game when you have played the arma series. arma 3 has a mod that is comming out that is called day z where players have to survive in a world full of zombies and bandits. you can find loot, fight zombies, find vehicles and mostly. fighting bandits. you can trust anyone, but they cant trust you... - stevenisadork",1
"this game is so fricking amazing. graphics are probably the best",1
"if like simulation military ganes this one is for you you can fly a jet thru a wall and not die you can also get shot by a rocket dierectly in the chest and not die best sim game ever",3
"i enjoy arma 3 most realistic military simulater i have played.",2
"arma is big, open world simulator, full of content, hard and realistic gameplay give you much fun and rage :p, but satisfaction after complete mission is unimaginable :d. another things are mods, wasteland, rpg mods or battleroyale give you new multiplayer experience, camping with assault rifle with 75x scope and try to kill people on 1000m distance is very good felling :). i highly recommend arma 3 + advantage <hard (for people who like this) <realistic simulation <multiplayer <zeus <mods nad custom scenario <long campain <huge open world (278 km2 !!) - disadvantage <bad optimization <high hardware requirements <hard (for casuals)",3
"one of the best games ive ever played. almost every update they releae makes the game almost like real life also the rpg servers are epic",8
"great game... buy it. no regret. multiplayer server is crowded with enthusiast people...",1
"great looking game! if military sims is your thing, this is the game for you. unfortunately its way too hardcore for me... back to batllefield with the rest of the filthy casuals.",1
"arma iii helicopters while exiting a helicopter it hit me and i died. i tried again and my parachute didnt deploy. i tried again and i died from hitting the air hard enough(wtf) arma iii ground vehicles my tank hit a fence and broke down. my truck did a flip on a 1 cm high pebble and crushed me. a quad bike nipped the back of my truck which caused it to explode as if it was hit by a rocket. arma iii pvp people go under the ground and shoot you. you get fatigued from walking 2 metres but a red dot sight will cure that for you somehow. you swap kills a lot because of lag. arma iii graphics graphics can be good but high end computers lag. arma iii fun doesnt exist.",1
"i have to say, this game is dam realistic :), and perfect! even without that mod called dayz",5
"dont be turned off by the simulator nature of this game. while the combat is meant to be realistic and when youre first starting out it can be a bit daunting to learn all the controls and simply learn how to aim the game underneath is fantastic. the campaign is a great introduction into the mechanics of the game and id highly recommend playing the survive chapter to get a handle on basic infantry gameplay. the game is extremely moddable and its super easy to make your own missions or to download missions made by other players. the game does have performance issues however and is very cpu bound. i found that with my fx 8350 crossfire is useless and results in no performance gain because the processor cant keep up, but if you have a strong single card solution then an fx 8350 will work fine. intel however is the preferred route for this game, but even then dont expect 60 fps gameplay. that said, the game is slow paced enough that 30 fps is more than sufficient and the game is absolutely gorgeous. id absolutely recommend it if youre a fan of games like americas army (atleast before the most recent iteration) and red orchestra, or mods such as project reality and insurgency.",1
"epic with 700+ hrs on this game it never gets old, theres always something to do to diff game modes or just ing around with your friends 10/10 would buy again",8
"very good game, extremly good graphic, sound, everything! some little bugs but nah, they will be solved i think, i recommand!",1
"i am actually very satisfacted with the changes that boheima has made to this game including things like better vehical sounds better vehical entrance animations reload animations weapon customiastion and more",1
"driving the helicopters is like getting molested by old men. its rough, it hurts and its moist.",1
"i love this game period its an amazing game i would recommend atlis life if you were to buy the game",4
"extremely fun team based combat with awesome graphics",5
"10/10 good game. the things that i don like is that there are a lot of bugs in altas life. but its still fun .",1
"it was a bad investment you ask why? well the frames per second were below average even when set at low settings maybe they need to optimize the game a little more i dont know. my recommendation is if you dont have a up to par gaming pc dont buy it.",1
"got this game yesterday and im loving it! theres a variety of things you can do such as campaign, editor, multiplayer and lots of user made missions you can download to play!",7
"since ive played arma 2 and most of the gamemodes for arma 2, i do have experience in the arma industry, although not on this account of course. this game, well to be specific, is that its great! i mean to say, that its not as great as say battlefield 4 or other such games, but it does take the cake for their pc versions. what you lack in arma 2 (graphics, weapons, explosions, pvp, more explosions) is definitely what is made up for with arma 3. from its massive maps to its all out war scenarios, youll (the general audience) will love this game like i do, or even more mayhaps. edited, re-written, by me",5
"really awesome game, but the performance is just all over the place or terrible.",1
"shot down a helicopter with lightning as zeus. 1/0",1
"along with the serious military aspect of it, the customization can lead to some pretty wide ranges of fun with friends. however, it is more fun to play with friends. single-player isnt much fun if you dont know what youre doing. 7/10",1
"i cant say much about the games single player experience, since i havent really done a whole lot with that. what i can say is that in large scale co-op missions, you really see this game at its full potential. this is easily one of the best co-op experiences ive ever had, and ive been gaming since i was 3 years old.",4
"fun game, very in depth if felt for an fps. you should have patience for some servers though, they will be figuring out which line you should stand in more than they will be doing stuff. if you like planetside 2 for the organization or players, this game will be fun for you.",1
"solid game. im disappointed they didnt polish it up a bit more before launch, but overall its an enjoyable experience and one that ive put a lot of time into. just make sure your pc can run it smoothly.",2
"ok first things first. this game has endless possibilities, great campain, pvp modes king of the hill or wasteland, even better pvp in battleroyale, role playing games like altis life and arma 3 life, zombie(dayz) mods like breaking point. in fact when you get arma its like you got 10 different games, which is awesome! my first day in altil life looked like this: i go get my licence, buy a car, get a delivery mission. i got one farest, like 26 kilometers acros altis. got on a highway, after couple of miles, i crash into abandoned vehicle on the middle of the road without toolkit. some guys found me on the road and gave me their truck so i could continue(awesome guys). couple of miles ahead guy jumps in front of my truck trying to rob me, and he did robbed me. he walked back into his chopper and somehow insta chrashed(talk about insta karma?). i picked up his money and procced, only to be pulled over by a cop for speeding, he wrote me a ticket. finally after 2 hours a got to my destination and delivered a package, i was so happy. 10/10 would recommend to anyone!",1
"quite possibly the best miltary simulator of all time",1
"come on; two guys went to jail to make this, literally. this game is awesome in every way aside from the amazing difficulty wall.",1
"i have to say that this game is a worthy successor of the arma series. it takes aspects of the other games and improves them, while adding new content and a storyline that hasnt had a single broken level, or ai with a choppy voice. however, this game just isnt finished yet. id wait until the horrible fps drops on multiplayer are fixed. once that is done, the game will be perfect. wait a while before you purchase this game.",3
"one of the best games i have ever p[ayed i love this game",1
"i really got deep into this game and i could tell from the moment i began playing that this was bohemias baby. the amount of detail in both the environment and realism was evident and it took me by surprize. arma 3 is a significant improvement over arma 2 in every area from the beautiful visuals to the ballistics of the weaponry. i personally am a sucker for realistic shooters so this was right up my alley, the feeling of dropping an enemy from 500 meters with one bullet really gets me excited. id recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of bohemias past games and likes more of a realistic shooter rather than arcade like shooters similar to cod ghosts and football manager 2014. get this game pronto as its really good actually just kidding everyone i couldnt run it at all i wish i was dead :(",1
"great shooter simulator! singleplayer might be boring for some people, but the online experience with a great community will give you a great time.",6
"best game ever! this game provides endless amount of fun and its amazing! worth the buy!",1
"work on that multy player fps drop bohemia for the love of god!!!!!!",1
"yes this is a great game, but the hardware requirement are to low i cant play on servers but single player is great.",1
"best game ever! needs some minor tweaks and i could recommend a few additional things that would make the game even better but if youre reading this section to find out whether it is worth buying --- i can honestly confirm that if you have a beaty enough pc this game is great!",3
"arma 3 is very relistic. deff not a run and gun type of game. but best feature of all is breaking point zombie mod. the mod works great",5
"arma 3 is a beautiful game it has realistic animations and much more! it is a open world combat simulater and you can move around the map by land, sea and air good luck on the batttlefield.",1
"can you make this free game so that everyone will install this until it returns into payment until march 13",1
"arma 3 is a one of the best purchases i ever made. considering that not only you get the main game (army simulator), but you can get many more mods (for free ofc), which are so much fun. for example battle royal, which is the mod leaving you and lot of other players on a n island, where you have to find a weapon, and kill everyone else to win (basicaly same as in the movie hunger games, or battle royale). another one breaking point is the one familiar to dayz. or there is a role playing mode where you are thrown into the city, and only you choose whether you are going to be criminal, or cop, or doctor, or anyone else. thing about this game is that its engine is really open for comunity to make its own modifications of the game. this game is based on comunity, so if you are bored of regular deathmatch shooters, and want to play shooter with more realistic atmosphere and better interaction with people, there is not better game for this pupose. and if you didnt actually get what i ment by this long boring review, just google a little bit and try to find many exciting mods that exist, or are in development. shortly... if gaben gives you sale on arma iii, go for it, you wont regret the money you will spend.",1
"amazing gamemods! got arrested for 41 manslaughters and for being the leader of a drug gang that collected, transported and sold lots of cocaine and weed over altis, in altis life game mode. 10/10",1
"amazing and very realistic game, with plenty of mods and a very active online community",3
"this game is by far one of the best tactical shooters i have ever played. i love the maps and the way the game feels in the way of how the weapons work, the movement, and the flow of the game just feel amazing.",8
"i can really recommend this game, its just awesome for so many reasons !! :d",1
"though i have not palyed this for the longest time, i have always been a fan of the arma series. i actually really like what they did with their newest game. it still pertains the original arma feel, but there have been a few changes from arma 2 i do not like. for example, i played alot of the campaigne and i find it strang how they made it that you die after about 2 shots (one to the head, three to the limbs), yet when i shoot an npc in the torso, it takes about half a magazine. i remember in arma 2 that the npcs had the same damage system as you. also, i feel that the first aid kits are a little bit cheap. in arma 2 if you didnt have a medic in your squad, or you wernt near a medical tent, you were screwed if you got shot, you would either crawl your way home if you were shot in the legs or shoot like a lawn sprinkler if you got shot anywhere else. im not saying its a bad game, in fact its a very good game, but previous arma fans be warned, there will be some things that will possibly get under you skin.",1
"fun, not just the gameplay, but the different modes. altis is hilarious, and other game modes are just outright fun!",1
"asked an ai to 1v1 me and his buddy killed me. freakin noobs.",1
"this game is very very fun if you look past the bugs and glitches. this is one of my favorite games beside arma 2.",4
"i played the alpha lite, and was not too impressed by arma 3, i saw it on sale and bought it. i can say i do not regret my choice. im having a blast with it thus far. if you played arma series before, you know what you are in for. content wise its lacking compared to 2, but that has been out longer. i have faith in the community to make some intresting mods for this game.",1
"its a great game. with all of the different gamemodes you will not go bored.",7
"i was talking to a guy in a courtyard and a tank out of nowhere squished him. so i stole his gear, then a guy came over a started shouting ahahahahahhahahahhhhhhhhhahahah with unusual music in the background while placing a satchel charge on the floor nearby and set it to 1 second, he then said fly me too the moon. ive always wondered if he fulfilled his dream of space flight.",1
"feels like i wasted my money. game looks beautiful, but it got too frustrating when it felt like everyone else was going on with the mission and combat, and i was left looking around for the enemy. outisde of waiting for some tracers to show up and give the enemy away, my efforts to eliminate my target were futile 99% of the time. id use up all my ammunition, and theyd land in a perfect shot, every single time. it got to the point that i would end up sitting back while the ai on my team took care of it- after all, they knew exactly what to do while im just sitting there shrugging my shoulders. this is not your typical combat fps. the controle are wonky, and i spent a hard-earned $60 on frustration. i have a titan video card. it runs all of my games on maximum settings flawlessly. with arma 3, it seems like all i do to ajust the graphics settings makes no difference, as im hit with major framerate issues. after a few days, i reinstalled the game to give it another chance, but i just couldnt get anything accomplished. i personally dont recommend the game.",1
"not the game for me, it has very good graphical detail but that is about it. multiplayer is very laggy and borderline unplayable, controller support is listed as a feature however only a select few controls can be mapped to it - making playing with it extremely difficult. i bought into it when it was 20 in early alpha, i would not pay 40 for it now, and im glad i didnt.",1
"i cant believe this ran on my inagraded graphics pc",1
"the graphics are amazing. this game is a must-have for a simulator.",3
"best army sim on the market. price may be a little big, but i dont regret it. 9 out of 10 highly recommend",1
"very good wish i had it played it for free and it is amazing",2
"my team died. i was all alone. i had managed to kill many of the enemy. when the path to the objective seemed safe and clear, i made a run for it. *boom* a grenade launcher shot blew up right next to me. i fell out of my chair in fear and had to take off my headset to make sure i was still alive. 10/10 would cry again",1
"great single player, fps isnt too good even with good computer, needs patch badly. multiplayer isnt good as the fps drops 1-20 fps not good at all, needs patch asap, since it has been out for a long time i guess they dont want to fix it at all.. making packs without patching the fps problem is a problem. other than this is good graphics, and good game. will not recommend till they fix the fps problem, seems like a waste of money..",1
"you really need to play this to realise what a skillbased shooter is all about. and its fun to boot!",1
"pretty realistic game. but it sometimes takes 20-30 min to find an enemy to kill. but still fan.",1
"in my opinion, its not optimized for the pc, but if you have a beast pc and you like realistic war games get it.",1
"bugs, hackers, glitches, unfinnished patches, unreleased vehicles, just right there would be enough to steer away anyone from purchasing this game. however, even with all that i still will play arma iii. the online multiplayer experiences are pheonominal, and definetly unique. if youve ever played massive online sandbox fps, for example, planetside 2, you will know the kind of online experiences to expect, however unlike other sandbox mmos, the experiences you get with arma, are changing. its not a repetitive, boring, same old grind. depending on what server you want to play on, you can find yourself, playing with other players against ais, using modern military tatics and utilizing resources to save a down player pilot, or you can find yourself running drugs in the cover of night trying to evade player police. as long as i have played arma iii, i cannot say that it has been boring for me. however this game is not for everyone, so if your not into the sandbox effect, i would continue on with your day, but if you enjoy unique experiences, and a endless interaction, then i highly recommend arma iii.",5
"totally worth your money. because its like garrys mod (community made stuffs) you can download anything problem is few are only hardworking on the workshop :/ because of course its hard (high res/quality items)",2
"lots and lots of glitches... could of been way better then that. i would never spend 59$ on this game... good thing i bought it when it was in beta.",1
"this game is not worth it, stay with arma 2,  arma 3",8
"brilliant military simulator, much better buy than other similar fps games. both campaign and multiplayer are diverse and immersive! f*** the aaf also...",2
"this game is so poorly optimized its a joke. runs at <24fps on my gtx780ti / i7-3770k. the worst pc exclusive title out there tbh.",1
"a lot less clunky than arma 2, infact arma 3s stance adjust control system should become standard. ive so far found the single player campaign a bit lacklustre, feels overly linear for such a non linear open world map. that said, playing the mod pilgrimage is much much more addictive and shows what this game is capable of. cant comment on multiplayer yet as i wanted to learn the control system (and finish pilgrimage) first but its safe to say thats where the real meat of this game is.",1
"very fun game to play. has alot to offer. the gameplay experience can be improved by mods if the game gets repetetive.",4
"seemed pretty fun, but i think it would be much better if it was actually optimised and able to get more than 25 frames. its way to arcadey, and took arma 2s barebone flight mechanics and somehow made it worse. barely anyone online (probably playing their $30 mod) too. playing this game makes me want to be a ing terrorist, so i could do the world a favor and kill the team at bi who made this. 9.999999999/10 its alright",1
"if you like playing with 15 fps this game is for you.",1
"i shot a 120mm round at a guys knee... i never saw him again 10/10 would recommend",2
"this is by far the best millitary sumulator out there and it is highly moddable so you can do almost anything you want",2
"so buggy / glitchy, so frustrating, that i dont play it.",1
"no matter what i try i cant get multiplayer to work. waste of money",1
"i reccomend getting arma 3 it is the best military/fps game i have ever played",1
"this is one of the best games that i got and i got a lot !!!",2
"alpha was fun. beta was fun. release was fun. 10/10 open world military infantry sim, loving every moment my computer can handle running it.",2
"i bought this game soley for altis life. was skeptical about the $60 price tag on it. but in the end worth it, i have definelty got my moneys worth from the multiplayer alone.",4
"i do enjoy playing this game and is very nice with the gameplay and the overall quality graphics etc. but isnt as enjoyable as arma 2 i would like to say buy this if you enjoyed arma 2 but this game sometimes feels more buggy and unreliable to play than arma2 did.",1
"good game but it needs pationt and to play with your friends .. if you like arma 2 , youll like this one",1
"this game always crashes. i dont like it. buy it now.",1
"arma 3 is the new age tactical shooter with more addons to enhance your game.",4
"from what i played of it i had a ton of fun especially in the multiplayer, it was all out chaos and i couldnt stop laughing i had a cop strip down and run into the ocean while firing his gun in the air and then someone drove their truck into the water and killed him. 1510 -ign",1
"a big step up from arma 2 game is much more optimized and the visuals are stunning. would defenitely recommend this over arma 2",1
"i really really love this game but i cannot play the new campaign! *spoilers* i cannot play the mission in which the player and his squad return to maxwell after it has been deimated by aaf. when i try to start the next oe, it simply says two hours later. the two hours later fades away but the mission itself never starts. this is extremely annoying for me and i know its just my game not everyone elses but if anyone knows how to fix this could you reply here? thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!",3
"well i got this in alpha release when it was $30 but if i didnt i would gladly pay the full price for it. awesome game i definately got 3 times my value that i invested in it and i am getting more!!! the updates will  your internet but they come with huge content. the developers are really giving people their worth in both time and money. easily becoming a better shooter then any cod game and is even leading the hard to beat bf series. my score: 10 out of 10 and it just got out of beta!!! cant wait to see what else the developers add to this!!",1
"amazing game! very fun and tactically impressive. best tactical shooter there is to date!",1
"very much worth the money, however you need a power computer to run it acceptably.",2
"an interesting game, dont buy it if you expect average close combat. most fights take place at 100m+ distance, weapons are laser-like accurate, and the smallest map is about 5x the size of battlefield 3s largest map. comes with a robust mission editor and splendid tactically realistic screenshot simulator (heh), the graphics are unbeatable. the campaign is pretty nice as well. +great graphics. +great infantry controls. +interesting campaign, even if the storyline sucks. +robust mission editor. +modding tools. +lovely aircraft sound effects, good vehicle controls. -hates your computer, doesnt want to run well. -ai is . -no weapon resting on random objects. -campaign ending was a cliffhanger.",9
"amazing 3rd or 1st person shooter that has a very realistic feel (aka simulator) hard to get bored with all the user created content and the editor. the controls can be a tad tough to learn at first but with in a few hours you should have them down. being able to mod your game file gives you tons of customizable things to do. i would recomend playing with a group of people because playing this game by yourself can tend to get boring. that is the only flaw iv been able to find really aside from a few random bugs here and there.",9
"this game is really my favourite game of 2014, without a doubt. a mix of strategy, graphics, weapons, explosions, and the mods with so much more just made this game one which i could play for hours without end. adding even one friend to your gaming experience will incease your gaming hours ten fold. the best thing about this game is that this game is still being largly developed with new dlcs, mods and patchs coming out regluarly so be prepard to see how good this game will get over these upcoming months. the only problem now you see will be your computer, you may need a more powerfull graphics card to run this game efficiantly. now get this game, make friends (i know i have) and have a blast :)",7
"great game with an insane amount of re-playability! super user-friendly, especially if youve played arma 2 for some time, as most things are identical (controls wise). some great mods to play, nice engine, decent fps and vac and trackir supported! if youre looking for a great combat simulator or just want a fun sandbox game to mess around on, then arma 3 is the game for you!",9
"fantastic game! this is not your typical cod or bf, this game requires patience, and wit. once you master those things, this game rewards you with a marvelous experience. the single player campagn is lengthy and challenging, tons of custom content, missions and not to mention the expansive multiplayer experience. i enjoy playing multiplayer coop the most in this game. working together is very rewarding and essential if you want to survive. its rare for a game to be so engaging that i keep coming back to it. 10/10",6
"why why why is this game so lagy i get 14 fps and i have a i7 4790k @ 4.7ghz and a msi r9 285 if i put all max i get like 14 to 40 fps on a good sever but wen i put all low i get 14 to 40 fps like wtf why is this game so bad like what do i need my pc cost 1,700$ like really and yall see why ppl go to consols fix this my god you have a very nice game and ppl still play it even if they only get 14 fps with the top of the line hardware this is ridiculous.",4
"this is a really good military simulation and i have to say. its really sitting on bf or any other silimar games face. this gives them a really big thumbs down if i may say. just as gran turismo is the real deal racing game, this is also the real deal combat game.",1
"doesnt get better than this game where you can go whereever on massive maps and use helicopters airplanes, boats, submarines, tanks, and jeeps in one battle. 12/10",2
"stratigic game, in this game you actually have to think :o unlike the  game cod",3
"most realistic shooter played. everything gets you killed including doing nothing. zombie mod is great too. not a casual game, very intense experience when your not running around. combat is quick usually ending within minutes with little or no room for error. you will need a good graphics card to play this game effectively. low graphic settings will comprimise your gaming experience. there are bugs and it is not perfect nor does it run as smooth (on older machines) as bf or cod; but it is an amazing game and i recommend it. 9/10",1
"improved handling, realistic to a point, military shooter wows me in its gameplay! also, strong and weak side urban prone.",1
"well  yes i highly recommend this game. its so intense!!",1
"lol i like how theres people who have hundreds of hours in it and leave it a bad review. this game is probably one of the best purchases ive made, i can always come back to it and have fun. the ammount of possibilities in the game is endless and for the most part has a great player base. your experience really depends on where/who you play with.. arma3 can either be a running simulator or a intense military simulator with moments you wont find in any other game. when you do happen to join an awesome server with coordinated people there is much fun to be had. buy it, dont look back.",4
"ill be quick and clear. im amazed how bohemia interactive has worked on this game, and the best is the support it has, performing the game every day. one of the best things about arma is the modding, and people developing it for our delight. i fully recommend this game.",2
"fantastic sim/game. learning curve is fairly small and incredably rewarding! if you like action games, blowing sh!t up, team work, driving, flying and diving! then this is probably the best game out there!",1
"after trying for about 5 hours in vain to just get past a small phase in a mission in the game, i can finally say i gave up. above the insanely hardcore combat system, i got killed countless times by mines that i cant understand how to tell their location, so its just a simple, annoying, random death. also the game has a lot of bugs, mainly graphic. id say the devs rushed too much. 5/10 game health, 3/10 gameplay, 8/10 graphics, -30/10 gameplay forgiveness. bought the game when it was 50% off and i regret spending every and each $ for this game which i just cant play.",1
"best game ever! there is so much content because of people making addons, missions, mods all the time, this is like 10000 games in 1. best purchase ive made! only down side is that its in the future. i mean that they are using prototype vehicles that nobody knows about. it would been a 10/10 game for me if they just made arma ii with this updated engine and graphics!",7
"feels like im having muslims up my . i love it! ps. i love you all.",5
"awsome realistic game, much better than cod of bf!",2
"was told not to run over goats with truck. did it anyway. 10/10",1
"personally i would put this game as m game of the year if not my game of the decade, the fact is even with its flaws, bugs and the perhaps not as optimised as it could be engine...i would still recommend this to anyone who has gotten tired of the average shooter, because this isnt one. arma has alwasy been a miliary simulator and hopefully always will be and this makes the game into something that no other first person game can top. the realism is brilliant and the combat stance mechanic is something fresh offering different ways to take cover, adding new ways to be tactical. not a fan of realism and seriousness? check the workshop and armaholic. you are bound to find something that will have you laughing, crying and having a blast. after all whats not to like about racing go-karts with heavy machine guns mounted ontop? if there was one thing that does bug me its the fact that rocks...tend to eat you sometimes if you get too close so be careful with that tl;dr version: buy the game or i will make a rock swallow you 10/10",4
"one of the best military game i ever played! although it has some annoying bugs and questionable ai, it still be a great game to have if you are into realistic game. aside from the core gameplay, this game contain a load of mod! you can turn military simulation game into zombie-survival game by choosing mods in steam workshop! 9/10 if i dare say.",2
"i do recommend this game from all the gameplay ive seen (i dont currently own the game) however, it is the only game i know that strategically promotes military warfare very very accuraretly. i love the stimulation of the game and i love every single thing about it even the bugs. if i had the opportunity to play it i would 100% give my full review about the game and my experiences. i can not afford it at the time however, even after i would fully support the game.",1
"severely overpriced considering that people play it because of the mods not because of the campaign mode or vanilla multiplayer. then on top of it they have the nerve to sell dlc that should have been included. they should be giving out large prizes to the top modders since they owe their success to them. bohemia interactive is not reputable at all. if this game was 30 dollars i would consider buying it but not at close to $70. i considered buying their mars game as well but if they overcharge this one i wont take a risk on the other one needing expensive dlc later.",1
"best army simulator game nowadays. many mods, much fun.",1
"so here is a military sim. it is a a very fun military sim. i have sat down and played most of the campaign, which had been enjoyable. a majority of my time has been put towards the mulitiplayer. the game has very many options and mods to play when it comes to multiplayer, some of them being breaking point, wasteland and king of the hill. all of them are great fun and i have had to at least sink about 15 hours in each. if you are looking for something that is fun to play with a group of friends and is a military sim, then this is a game for you. i would give this about 3.5/5. just because it still does have some bugs but would gladly say that this has the potential to be a 5/5 game once a lot of those issues are ironed out.",1
"i was promised explosions, mountian dew and doritos, but all i got was a walking sim.",1
"great game fun to play this game gives so much online game modes to play you will never be bored :d",1
"if you are tired of just run of the mill shooters like i was then this is the game for you. all i wanted was a tactial shooter that you actually had to think about what you did before you did it instead of running and gunning and that is exactly what i got from arma and i love it.",1
"really neat game, realistic, fun, and totally worth the money.",3
"dayz breaking point mod amd koth is bae with a group of 2-5 competent friends who can get over the steep learning curve and unforgiving deaths. but with all that nonsense you get loot and you can kill people and establish houses and territories. very sandbox mil-sim game 9.75/10 (add more to breaking poing mod)",4
"absolutly amazing for team play. great tactical game... expecially with friends.",4

"wery bad performance, my system can run crysis 3 in decent fps (30-150)on high settings, but this crap is not playable at all (5-18 fps) fx4170 , 7750 cf , 8 gb ddr3",1
"i hope most if not all of the bugs and issues there are fixed through beta and release. for an alpha it was very impressive but i feel there is still some work to do to make the game the best it can possibly be and with a price of 19.99 ($32.99   24.99) is almost idiotic to pass up. i imagine on full release that price will go to the normal price for a new game on steam, either 29.99 or 39.99, so get it while its hot.",1
"would be better if i could actually play the game for more than 20 minutes.... but no.",1
"graphics are great. realistic. now i just need all of my friends to buy it!!",1
"i hate the dlc system. you buy a game and can only enjoy a part of the content. i pay money for a complete game not for parts of a game. almost wish that pirating will be popular again, so game developers need to deliver great stuff to get the buyers back. with that said, its still a good game, but it could have been great!",3
"the best simulator and its called arma! literally the best game ive ever played",1
"i like this i am far from good at it if anyone plays it hit me up im down for some training",1
"an awesome game, been playing since arma 1 and it never failed to satisfy my cravings for war.",2
"this review is mostly on the vanilla version or the base game you buy. i say mostly because i recently started playing with the agm mod. anyhoo... arma 3 is a great game in my opinion. it is nothing like the general populations idea of a first person shooter (fast-pace, best connection required, twitchy shoot each other). this game actually requires you to think and try and stuff. you have to try to out think and out strategize your enemy. if i had to choose this or arma 2 oa strictly on gameplay, i would chose this hands down. now with every game there are a few things that could be changed. in the vanilla arma 3 those things are ai that can snipe using only a red dot sight, the small amount of guns, small amount of vehicles, and your friendly ai skipped the week in basic training where they learned to listen to their co. the thing about all arma games is that they are easily moddable. so all of these problems have been addressed with mods. overall i would give this game an 8/10. it is extremely fun to play coop missions with your friends along with things like wasteland and altis life. i havent played breaking point at the time of this review, the arma 2 dayz epoch mod has pretty much kept me satisfied with zombies.",3
"i loved arma2, sepnding endless hours building missions, and adding 3rd party content. initially arma3 was the same, although it could be a bit laggy.... and then out of the blue, the audio became very broken, stuttery and utterly disjointed, and the game itself started running at 7-9 fps, whilst complaining that bacause it was modded (its not) and that i may encounter problems (i am). ive uninstalled and re-installed, and can see zero improvement - despite all settings now put to low. sorry guys, not good enough. it makes me question the value of steam, as arma2 never had any such issues, and with steam, i no longer feel in control of whats going on, and what is, or had been, loaded. very unhappy.",1
"the game itself is good, the multiplayer is difficult to get used to but it is insane. the only real problem with it is that the people who run the servers are all 13 year olds who have these little things called server rules which usually pertain to if you run someone over, server ban. if you kill someone outside a red circle, server ban. if you do anything fun that can make another person mad, server ban. in other words, this is not dayz where you could torture people. however- highly enjoyable game.",3
"deffinatly recomend this game, ive spent over 800hrs on this and have loved every bit of it!!!!!!!!!!",10
"arma 3 is the modern combat simulation of 2013-2014. actually that was a lie. arma 3 is anything you want it to be. a first person shooter. a role playing game... arma 3 fits all genres. if you want something and have the means to make it. you can. all because of the new arma 3 engine. personaly i think arma 3 knocks battlefield & call of duty off the board. even if most people think the faces on arma 3 look like total crap compared to other shooters on the market. graphics dont matter, its the content of the game thats most important. plus arma 3 is open world. no scripts, no dumb game barriers, no seeing through walls crazy ais. everyones game expirence is different depending on their actions. i mean arma 3s maps like altis and stratis are just plain massive! i 100% reccomend buying this game regardless of the type of computer you have. well obviously you need to meet minimal requirements to even play the game. also people who have intel hd graphics mobile. you may face some difficulties. get ready to see real warfare.",3
"this is an absolust beast of an game. recommend it to everyone! stunning graphics and many hours of brutal gaming. 10/10",1
"get some friends to play this game with you and it is fun, not even kidding this game has to be one of my top 5 games!",7

"this game changed my life i now am able to get all the females",9
"beautiful game nice game if you have 60usd buy this game im trust",1
"this game is absolutely amazing. it can be whatever you want it to be deliver any experience you are looking for. whether that be hardcore realism like no other game imaginable, shooting with your friends and driving karts, simply taking in the beauty, and everything inbetween, this game can provide it. it may be slow paced at times, but this allows for a scale beyond all others. in no other game can i say that i had a good time in a mission, but also have used my compass more than my trigger.",1
"the arma series is the best by far. in my opinion no game can top it for simulation or realism. arma 3 could do better tho. (no offence)... ... ... as it says in the description experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox.... i would love to have arma 3 go a little bit more into detail with some aspects of the game. but becides that it is amazing. i would recommend this game to anyone who like military games. if ur a cod or battlefeild (which i am but not as much as arma 3) fan watch out because arma 3 is the next big thing. > profile name <, game on!",6
"extremely fun and addicting game with all the various mods and game matches u can play, its never ending with the creativity the community has and as the game has great editing and coding that u can do to match what u want to incorporate into the game its just great fun as all players come and give in feedback and play the game :) recommend for anyone, worth the buck.",2

"greedy dlc, the game is still in beta. the funnest thing to do by far is koth online but good luck getting in a server, randomly the server broswer will flip out and report 0 servers. at which time the only solution is to completely restart the game. every time hearing that stupid theme when it starts up, duh duh dunnn duh! server broswer reports 0 servers, restart.... duh duh dunnn duh! 15 bucks for a couple of rifles and diffrent color guillie suits <.<, helicopter pack 15 bucks, still in beta my . money grab, poorly optimized 6/10 duh duh dunnn duh! ....... 5/10",3

"dont get this game if you dont plan on playing it with mods. seriously. dont do it. vanilla a .",4
"the greatest military sandbox i have ever played, arma 3 is a lovingly crafted game, giving you an endless amount of scenerios to enjoy. singleplayer gives you the option to screw around with the editor and either create the insane or the epic. its a challenge to learn but well worth it. the main campaign can be frustrating at times, but overall is a very excellent experience. user-made content and scenerios add another layer of depth, and zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer. multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game, giving an in-depth experience in many a situation. you can play it as a roleplayer, joining life servers. you can be a survivor of the wastes in wasteland, or you can join in many user-made situations. the greatest of the options, however, is proper, team-based objective gameplay. with the right men, squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds. it gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team, and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling. if you want a very-well made military simulator, offering wonderful graphics, processor-melting situations, teamwork, tension and combined-warfare operation, arma 3 is for you.",8

"pretty good game... would be a great game if it was better optimized. i would get it on sale but i wouldnt pay full price for it. edit: this game has so much potential but the developers failed to optimize the game at all. do not buy this game until they fix it, if they ever do... so disappointing and such a let down.",2
"arma 3 has made me hate every other fps, because in arma you have the freedom to do what ever you want. the games modding community is great, which keeps the game interesting with new maps, guns, vehicles, etc. the game is not that well optimised but it performs well enough and looks great. there is a lot of great gamemodes that get overshadowed by wasteland and altis life gamemodes. one great example is teetimes captrure the island gamemode. the zeus dlc is a great tool to make cool missions on the fly and the great thing about is that you dont need a dedicated community for it, you can just jump on a public game and have fun. arma has incredibly detailed mission editor in which you can spend tons of time just exploring the map, blowing up some ai, learning to fly a helicopter, and so on. if you like shootters and would like to play something more realistic get arma 3.",3

"this is my first review. arma 3 is one of the most realistic military sim youll play in awhile. the realism beats battlefield, but is slower. at first if youre not use to it you will wonder how you died. after awhile you will realize that you were shot around 500 meters away. arma 3 is for the players who want more realism than battlefield.the game has many positives and some negatives that i can note. positives: + amazing graphics in some places + big maps (2 really big islands, with one about 270km squared) +a decent amount of vehicles / weapons +alot of uniforms for player customization (using the virtual ammo box, that is present in some servers) + a very good editor and a real time edior named zeus + life like situations with other players + no annoying kids like call of duty negatives: - the campaign does not have a story that leaves an impression - the ai downright has no iq - needs a good computer - the map though big in some places are really just open land - hard to learn the game has its shares of positives and negatives, but will not be like any other game youve ever played. dont buy this game if you wont take the time to learn how to play. that is because it will overwhelm you if you perfer games like call of duty.",3

"[do not read negative posts, they are extremely misleading] i went ahead and just bought it with the 50% off sale, and i wouldnt be angry if i had paid 60 dollars for it. it is a top game indeed with so much to do, it is more than a warsim, it is much more than what is advertised...dont think twice, just go get it! its definitely worth it. yes your pc needs to be somewhat good for this to run well but i was scared about this very same issue and turns out it runs amazing in ultra settings for me.",2
"most realistic fps you can find, although its a lot more fun when you have people to play with.",1

"cant say enough good about this game, so much more fun than the run and gun games. i enjoy making missions and playing them with my friends, the mod community has to be one of the best ever... other than some bugs here and there which i know the game is constantly being improved upon makes it one of my favorites, if you are tired of the generic run and gun shooters and want a game that actually makes you have to think , ammo count, health, team members, this is the one. i got tired of the others. (wont mention their names ) they kept tweeking them and wrecked the games for me. so you could say i got tweeked right out of them. i am a little over a half century old and have been gaming for many many years. the operation flash point days were a blast, and to see this evolve into what it is today is just great. if i could add anything to this game, it would be the ability to jump, and maybe a flame thrower tank. and the ability to put c4 on a small drone :) i recommend this game for fun",4

"even though i only get 15 fps in a city/town and 30 fps in the countryside on this game, i still think it is one of the best games i have played. it still has some work to be done to it but thats just what the series is like, a bit glitchy. some of the good points are 290km map with no limits, its a sandbox so you can do whatever the hell you want and a quite good campaign (well, thats what i think). some of the bad points are that it is quite boring for some people. it can run pretty well on pcs without having a very good graphics card. (i have a amd radeon 7730m 2gb graphics card and a i7 core in a laptop and i can run the game!) this is one of my favorite games from one of my favorite series and i am glad i brought it. 9/10 if you like sort-of realistic first person shooters, then i would recomend you get this game.",3
"this game has pretty good looking graphics. the options or configure menu could be hard to understand to some players. the controls are overcomplicated. ragdoll physics is horrible. but the game is trying to be more tactical like,well its not tactical at all most of you enemies run out in the open like hey! look at me! shoot me!. playing alone isnt to great but with friends you capture the whole experience of arma 3. the maps are huge so you have to do lots of exploring,pretty cool if you enjoy exploring. the vehicles have their own controls maybe except the land vehicles and some other type of vehicles. the air vehicles are hard to control unless you played the rest of the armas.(btw still dont know how to use air vehicles). is this a full release or a beta? i do not know it has plenty after plenty of bugs to fix. like when that time i shot some one his body had an oversized neck the body itself had its body armor turned into a size of a pea. this game is 4/10 hard to recommend.",1
"for some this might be a teriffic game. for others, who dont want to spend 20+ hours figuring out the keybindings, it will not be. lots of great hardcore simulation options and when you get together with a group who knows what theyre doing, it can be fun. if youre looking for a casual shooter, this is not for you.",1

"its like arma 2 but with less content, poorly optimised and cash grab dlc (loadmasters anyone?). was hoping it would get better but its still worse than arma 2 in almost every way except graphics, i think ill stick to operating in chernarus and takistan instead of a greek island that has anti-framerate technology.",1
"this is basically life, a view of our future and a great game from any perspective. i value this games smaller features as well as its larger features. this game is probably one of the best games i have ever played if i havent made this clearer above. i want to see more games based around the user other than games based around unrealistic lies of war which clearly arent fun.",4
"fantastic shooter/milatary sim butstill need to fix mini bugs but they dont really matter :d",2
"me in the  and call me samantha, this is a good game.",1
"if you like playing games youll like playing this game.",2
"awesome war simulator- air-land-infantry battles. huge map",2
"dont buy this game in its current state. its worse than playing with a melted gi. joe",2
"this game is awesome i love it its so realistic and everything so i will continue playing this game cause it is to awesome alright :)",1
"really awesome military simulator realistic while being fun and have amazing graphics! also really awesome community with loads of game-modes and mods !",1
"i wont lie, this game messed with my head when i first got it. i dont play single player or king of the hill or any of that. epoch is the way to go. start with nothing a build your way up? amazing. certianly helps to have people who know what theyre doing teach you. 9/10 (only because i always get kicked for high ping -.-)",2
"this game brout me 2 tear first time i play.... wow...!....wat a xpereance. truly beutifull game play 1210/7",1
"meh. unless your a really devote tactical millitary fps player this probably isnt for you",1
"very good team based shooter, tactics will be your key to winning in this game, one warning though multiplayer in this game on pub servers are super broken, find a batallion and this will be one of the best tactic games you will ever play, its also not very optimized you will play with your settings manually because optimization doesnt work",1
"a fantastic game which hold countless hours of gameplay and stories and funtimes :dddd",2
"love the battle royale and wasteland not much else",1
"wow... when i bought this game i thought that i was going to play it like 1 hour or so. but now that i bought it, im addicted. it has endless gamemodes. maybe its expensive, but its worth it.",2
"if you take arma 2 and remove the third-world setting charm (balkans, middle east, africa, etc.), solid background of already existing mods (ace, various total conversions, well playtested islands), and dedicated community of milsimmers and replaced all of that with pseudo-operator lolmagpul multicam pmc greek futuristic garbage you get arma 3. you should buy it if and only if these things in arma 2 were of gamebreaking value to you: lack of ragdolls horrible vehicle physics (though a3 is not much better) having multiple guns to handle attachments as opposed to simply attaching items to the gun the gear system in general minimal amount of physical positions (prone, crouched, standing) other than that, stick to a2. theres just more to do.",1
"arma 3 seems to have a lot to offer in terms of multiplayer, but still not so much for the player looking to the single player experience.",1
"read this before you buy the game, because youre about to step into a massively new world. arma 3 was such a big leap since arma 2 and left many arma players shocked (including me). with new weapons, vehicles, infantry, drones, maps, and more leaves you with a brand new world to explore. now that you can swim, you have a wider access to the new maps. unlike arma 2, you will actually enjoy swimming in the ocean! there is much more to talk about, but its too much to explain. one word before i go, amazing.",4
"i just want my steam badge, but this game is pretty good",8
"big learning curve, but super realistic. its a sandbox war simulator, so you can literally be or do almost anything! really good fun once you learn the ropes and find a good squad to play with.",7
"dont buy since the last patch theres been thousands complaining there game crashes",5
"best game ever perfect for playing with friends on multiplayer shooting random players and other stuff",1
"omega squad members run me over with vehicle. 10/10 would play again.",3
"this is the most buggy game i have ever played in my life. i had all settings turned down to low so that i could work my way up to see what settings i could use comfortably but once i turned shadows on all the characters and guns went multicoloured and it put the fps down from 60fps to 1fps.",1
"zeus was the best thing to ever happen to this game!",1
"nothing to say about the game except that its awesome. waiting for it to be on sale to get it. :)",3
"arma 3 is great with friends and also when your board you can mhave fun with other people.",1
"train simulator with tanks and youll be teamkilled more than you encounter an enemy.",5
"so, another amazing game from bohemia. arma3 is very beautifull and well made game. from arma2 it got more into simulation part, but lacks some vehicles and weapons variety, but all of that is being add... with purchasable dlc (that sucks, but for this game- worth it).",2
"boss. most hardcore army game out there i guess. and looks great too in a massive open world",3
"do you want to feel like youre about to die, when youre actually not? do you want to feel the fear of almost being shot when you escape by just one hair? well arma 3 is the game for you, one of the most intense and nailbighting games ever. when you come so close to living the dream in altis life and you die can be annoying, but when you escape near death can be just as amazing as killing someone and picking up their loots! arma 3 is one, if not the greatest millitary sims ever! -ps you need a good pc. :p",2
"i have had endless hours of fun with this game it is absoulutely amazing, get the game!!!",7
"arma three fits into the modern fps category very poorly, its not a bad game its just not cod, a better category would be tfps, tactical first person shooter, cause thats what it is, its also a very fun and challenging game.",5
"great game !!! one of the games i never get bored with. huge territory, a freedom of play that any other game of its genre never surpassed from the 1st operation flashpoint till todays arma 3. but above all, it is its community players and modders that make it awesome !!! if the single player campaigns can be a bit boring questioning ai (even though i enjoy playing them), the game is very powerful going into multiplayer games. thousands of mods, maps, addons like weapons, uniforms, realistic behaviour (shooting, wounds, medics,), zombie like mods improves ai mods, and so on, i cant write all as it is one of the richest game community i ever experienced. a must have ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! thanks so much bohemia interactive for these many years of fun :d ps: i just have one remark, is that im still waiting for a mac osx version of the game.",3
"at first watching trailers for arma 3 i was not impressed, i have never liked futuristic games but as soon as i finaly picked this game up i loved it. so much you can do compared to arma 2, like the work shop, you can load custom missions and i love how you can change gun attachments. if you are unsure i would highly advise you to buy this game. may not look like much, but believe me it is.",2
"i would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have diversity from being able to play a milsim to somebody who wants to mod the living daylights out it, there are many mods that subtle changes to the drastic changes like the dayz mod. i think it has the variety to be able to keep any player attracted the arma series for a long time.",2
"played game for 150 hours. stopped playing for 2 weeks. relaunched game, joined server, walked 2 meters and global ban. 1/10 would not walk again.",2
"its a amazing simulator, it has amazing communcation techniuges the bring gamers toghethor and make them use there brain more.",1
"this is avery amazing game though u have to have a very good pc to run it properly",1
"this is a real review, i have been playing this since alpha release. i had this on an old steam account but got hacked so thats why my hours arent high up there but this game is amazing, the inventory system is awesome and so much better than arma 2. there are things i go back to in arma 2 so both are awesome. there is a bug right now that came recently for arma 3 in the inventory system but its uncommon to happen. if you like military simulators this is a great one to try, plus the many mods created for it so far. also there are dlc that come out for it.",2
"this game is just so awesome. since its a military simulation sandbox, even the campaign missions are very diverse, fun and ramdom. although it has a script, anything can happen. its just so much fun! and the graphics are amazing! 10/10",2
"i have always been a fan of the arma series because its really different than the other shooters. there are so many different ways to play this game, i spend hours scripting and fooling around in the editor for my own enjoyment. i dont play multiplayer that much but its still a great experience when i get to it. this game is very heavily gpu and cpu dependant so i wouldnt reccomend this to people who have a low-mid range gaming pc. mid ranges might still be able to run it but you will get lots of fps drops below 30 fps. this game is really fun and easy to get into. i am proud of the work that bohemia interactive is doing and continue to be a fan of their titles. i rate this game a 9.5/10.",2
"after 10++ hours in this game, you will realize that shooting a real gun is far more simple than killing an ai in this game",1
"recommended for people who enjoy cod. but feel trapped in tiny maps with no ability to drive/fly vehicles at will. arma has all of those and more",3
"awesome graphics and the gameplay is highly realistic",1
"dont buy this game. the ban u for nothiing. goodbye 70 euro.. ty",1
"the game is worse than arma 2. although this game has better physics, still worse. 39/300 - ign",1
"severely underated game. even with its growing popularity, its still overlooked by many many people. trying to get my friends to play it is a chore, probably because theyre too pansy to make any effort to get through the learning curve.",2
"dont buy it! even though its on sale its a robbery its very laggy boring and the shooting is bugged it just sucks",1
"most people dont want to buy this game because they were displeased with the last game arma 2 but bohemia kicked it up a notch im so amazed on how good of a job they did on this game its my money well spent!",3
"arma 3 offen used as a combat sim for clans can be boring and demanding but the game itself is great the game looks and feals like an open world combat game, with that being said the community behind it are very much the weakist link in the game modders clans and servers all think they own the game they like to play i am higher ranked then you! moders dont code in the best way they can and then lie about what the games engine can and cant do, there are fine pepole out there playing this game but mp is as with every other game full of pepole you would like to punch in real life. is it worth the money? for single player alone this game is worth it and mp/mods are the 2th best thing in the game if you liked arma 2 you will also like arma 3. arma 3 is only an upgrade to the already great arma 2 new maps and content leave this game fealing freash and new. the one thing i hate the most about the game is the fact that it is based on prototype tanks planes atc they are not real! and this leaves the game fealing like a peace of the future not what i like imo",2
"not for casuals, cod spoons or bf3/4 unlock hoarders, and relatively closer to milsim then alot of things. its like an iphone, its good out of the box but great once you jailbreak it. standard is fun but finding and playing popular mods is where it really shines. great graphics and not sure why people sulk about it, have no problems running it on a rapidly aging rig. would recommend",5
"i loved flashpoint, but this game has one of the worst singleplayer campaigns ever! at some points completely unplayable. if you are into singleplayer - dont buy this game. the only thing you can enjoy here is the multiplayer which can be awesome at some points and it is the only reason why i have bought this game - at some point i was hoping the campaign will be at least a little enjoyable, but i am very dissappointed now. i dont recommend buying this game until they fix all the issues in the campaign.",1
"you can make meth and grow some gread beard action aswell as loose your hair and become the heisenberg you always wanted. also tartan fedoras 10/10 take my dogecoin  the moon",2
"i truly enjoy this game. it is very fun. it would be better if the ai werent so strong. i swear it takes 10 shot in the head to kill one. but other than that it is great!",2
"this game just makes me feel incredible, it feels like your in the game going with it. i love it its really nice textures nice detail and best thing of all its best game you cuold posibly buy in might cost alot but its worth it. its a simulation,military,multiplayer,action,tactical,realistic so many things you cuold think of. ill give it 10/10 the best shooting action simulation tactical game ive ever played thx developers! :d",1
"it is a great game for people who like to play games that challenge them not just mentally but phsically becuase it is really addicting to people who like realistic combat and fight where there is bullet drop and hardcore gaming.",7
"great game; i would love an rpg (role playing not rocket propelled) experience.",5
"played it for 2 hours during the free weekend! it was amazing! i was speechless at the graphics of the terrain, they were simply unbelievable! i was playing it on my new laptop and i was running easily above 40fps!!! i wish i could buy it but sadly i got no money left from my laptop :( the people playing it we great and supportive. it was slightly harder to handle driving at first but after 20 minutes it was easy! if you are thinking about buying this game and have the money, dont think!!!!!! just buy it :d !!!",6
"its got nowhere near as much content as arma 2 but with an engine thats leagues beyond arma 2s operate hard a",1
"its really cool, like i really like i played the demo and its really cool make a update where you can shoot threw a door :)",1
"a great addition to the arma franchise! the graphics in it are amazing. pros - arma scale combat amazing graphics amazing community/ mods cons - ais can instantly find you/ have amazing aim ais can spot you from 500 meters from down hill through fog.",1
"when i first got this game i was hoping it would be great but when i started playing i didnt enjoy it. 1. for me the gamplay is just very dfficult even on the easiest difficulty. 2. the game seems kinda broken and unrealisic. and 3. its just not fun. not worth it",1
"this is a fantastic fps/tps shooter. for those of you who play cod & battlefield, this is hardcore fps here. beautiful graphics, fantastic freedom, but whats the catch? well, you need a mega pc to run this  game. anything beyond a gtx 690 should run it well on. not sure on amd though. plz cod 9 yr olds, do not ruin this game with your stupid raging. kthxbai",2
"it takes a while ti get use to the tactics you have to employ to be good at it but it is very entertaining. not for run and gun type players. you need patience to enjoy this game.",1
"amazing game, mus buy if into military simulations or the arma series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"the best installment of the arma series so far. laggy gameplay seems to have been fixed to the great extent, interesting and intensive, dramatic single player campaign reminds the original operation flashpoint times. recommended for all tactical warfare simulation fans.",1
"bought this game for more dayz. found many different life mods and a couple others that are really fun. great buy and i havent even played any of the arma 3 missions yet!",1
"not a fan of this game. i try to like it as much as i can, but the graphics and the sound are so off-putting that i usually just give up on it. maybe this time around with some friends i will finally be able to get into the game and enjoy it.",1
"dont waste your money on this one if you ask me. if youre really really in to tacital  like this, then get it, if youre a pro cod camper then play it because thats all you do; camp. the game is camping and running to better camping spots and when you see something hostile lagging to hard to do anything about it. you need a great computer and some google help to have okay fps and you need extreme patience to connect to servers and actually play the game.",1
"very fun, a big improvement in the arma series. that fatigue system though :p",2
"dont play any multiplayer. i got my a3 key stolen and battleeye wont help in anyway. however it is a great game and i recommend buying.",3
"great game! if you have an uber-super-awesome computer. seriosly though, the lag is real on a dual core cpu so you might need to consider upgrading to quad.",1
"brilliant game, can use some help though some bugs are annoying..",2
"i dont even own this game. 10/10 id play it again",1
"one of the greatest stratigcal fpss out there. a really good pick up.",5
"anti-tank simulator. fences are the main weakness to every vehicle in the game. remember this. also trying to jump over a trash can will instantly kill you. 10/10",3
"fun tactical game. dayz has made it to it so makes it twice as fun. play it for your opinion.",1
"really nice game.. beautiful aswell. just the campaign made me rage xd",3
"frankiam played 500+ hours 11/10 must buy to be cool",1
"if you like shooting things this is the game for you",4
"love this game its entertaining and keeps you occupied for hours, sometimes theres s on there but i can deal with them.",1
"arma 3 is a very fun, open world game. it has an extremely large modding community, and is widely played by those throughout the world. it contains a scenario editor in which you can create your own missions for you and/or others to play together. it has a unique scripting lanuage, which is difficult to learn at the beginning, but is very flexible once you learn it. the community has much variation, from player age, experience, heritage, etc. and is a great game for those who really like combat/strategy.",4
"was driving around with a friend in a car. drove off a small hill, and proceded to stop moving. asked why we had stopped moving. friend answered: we appear to have lost a tire walked 5km to the next objective. 10/10 would lose tire and walk to objective again.",1
"why cant arma 3 be simble to play with friends or remotely. this rarely works. i followed step by step with the ports and ip address. the firewall has been turned off. any advice?",1
"this is not a game you play on your own. youll be missrable",3
"first off, let me say that arma 3 is a pretty amazing game with a great community... if you can run it smoothly. i run a pretty nice rig with a gtx 770 (wayyyy above the recommended) and get around 40-55 fps on ultra in singleplayer, but somehow run 20-25 max fps in multiplayer. this fps occurs on all the settings in multiplayer, including low. if bohemia fixed the fps problem id gladly tell them shut up and take my money please help us help you!",1
"arma iii is a game you cant just casusally play, you have to experience its rich graphics and amazing detailed simulation of battle. when you have a gun in your hand you seem to take better care of it and use the minimum amount of bullets to save ammo. they is so much to explore as there is a vast multiplayer experience filled with battle royale and team deathmatches. it really is a great and fun game!",1
"this game is by farr what my expectaions were for it, if only i had a better pc for the best grapihcs and extra non snese",2
"deep engine, challenging gameplay, unique story, kickass guns. i officially love this game",1
"this game is awesome. one of the best military simulators out there. tired of dayz but not the franchise? arma 3. have fun.",1
"this game is very good to say the least with mods and missions coop and pvp and pve is this a fun and fair game and with 100 slots on some servers i can be really fun. if u are doing good but othervise i can get a bit frustated when playing becuse of the small places enemis tend to stay.",1
"this game is a really fun game. it could use improvements like a better modding community but other than that everything about it is great. it takes a toll on your computer if you dont have a good one, but still i heavily recommend it.",3
"best opensand box,shooter,reallife game for pc out there!",5
"awesome game. love it. cant wait for more updates to come and this is way better than any other game",3
"nice game , nice graphics , i recommend for all people to play this game :)",1
"if your pc can handle it, buy the game! its the combat sim, with as much depth as you choose to look for. a truly peerless take on war and all of its facets, and go-karts...... joking aside, forget op-fp, arma and this games well worthy little brother arma 2 (that brought dayz into being), the only way is up, and the only way is onward.... that means arma 3 so unless arma 4 is due within months, forget cod, bf, farcry, dayzsa and any shooter going, this is the only worthy title from the last generation, and will be here for years to come. get it on sale (about 20) and you will not be dissapointed for months to come (perhaps years?)",1
"its grown on me a little......*looks at hours played*",4
"probably one of my favorite and most played games 10/10 <3",3
"warning: this game will make you wanna cry yourself to sleep somtimes. this game is also never ending fun whenever you arent getting bohemiad. you are able to cuss out your enemies when you kill them - 10/10",8
"best war simulator out there. needs a lot of polishing though! also it feels a little alien with all the futuristic weapons. would have been nice with present weapons. luckily there is a very active modding community that is very skilled. a most have game in my opionion.",8
"my game wont install its really annoying can anybody help?",1
"i run it at the lowest settings and get 8 fps but its still fun",1
"awesome war simulator game! way better than arma 2 and the storyline is more flowing and interesting! you must get it!",1
"is a really fun game a most buy game if you have a beast pc because i have a gtx 670 and in some server i can bearly get 60 fps or 40",1
"best game for team work and endless fun. great graphics too, but you need a beasty system though to enjoy max settings. cpu hungry",3
"if by chance you are fortunate to be right-handed, use default controls at all times, dont mind that even this comes with several impairing elements, dont mind tons of glitches and unstable content, dont mind wading through to find actual significant content yourself or want to put in dozens of hours of effort to make content in a steep and vague learning curve...then this game is the best a military simulation can do for now.",1
"when i played this for the weekend it was free, i automatically wanted this game. it has great graphics (so long as you can handle them) and there are many different things to play to arma 3. much like arma 2, there is wasteland (basically a sandbox part where you can go on 3 different teams blufor, opfor, or independent. and you can collect weapon crates, get vehicles, and do missions). there is a mission called altis life (if you dont know what it is, then you must look it up on youtube). there is also another mission, this one im not sure if it was on arma 2, but it doesnt seem like it. this one is called king of the hill. this game mode and 3 different teams fighting for one objective as the biggest firefight you will ever have. ive never played it myself but my friends who own this game tell me its a very fun, and addicting game mode. so i recommend this game to anyone who likes games like arma 3.",2
"this game is cod. fun stuff, cause cod is fun. get it? its fun. done",5
"this is a proper military sim, but has a very steep learning curve.",1
"the greatest accomplishment a game can have is to leave lasting memory with the player. i find that this is especially true for memories that you can share. arma 3 can provide these in abundance. it is easily one of the best sandbox games i have ever played. ill never forget escaping from a temporary prison with a handful of friends, spending hours slowly and stealthily making our way to a heavily guarded communication tower, taking out an entire platoon in a surprise attack, and finally making contact with friendly forces for extraction, only to be told to rendezvous on the opposite side of the island. of course, the enjoyment of these games is also dependent on the people that you play it with, so be sure to pester all your good friends so that they can play this with you. for as graphics and physics heavy as this game is, it handles surprisingly well. gameplay wise, you will have to relearn everything youve been taught for fpss. if youre not extremely careful and working as a team, youre going to die swiftly and painfully. the number of player made missions is amazing. this game has a bit of a learning curve, but not nearly as much as the previous titles in the series. please, if you want to have some fun with friends, get this game.",1
"despite the performance issues, i have to admit, i love the game. its the best military simulator available. i recommend that you have an extemely beefy pc. also, check this link. it will help with the performance.",1
"sadly i have to not recomend this one, so i got this game expecting hours of fun screwing around on servers, which didnt disapoint, however, that being said, it lacked in many areas. for one, the graphics had much to be desired, and animations clipped horrificly, no to mention the complexity of the controls. its not a bad game, but the graphics and such need to catch up to the content",1
"i dont even have the game but its allowing me to write this. i win.",1
"i found this game to be very fun and i really recommend it for people who have the time and patientce. couple things i dont like though... 1. its in the future. (i dont like futuristic games) 2. you have to pay for more snipers and helis. 3. its really hard to kill people unless they have fatigues or civi clothes on. 4. no instant death on headshots i really recommend this game and i also recommend for anyone who buys this game to get the karts dlc.",3
"found server. got drivers license. run over dude. gets banned for vdm. 10/10 would vdm again.",2
"if your computer can play it on at least normal settings with 30+ fps, must buy! 11/10.",9
"if you have friends its a beautiful game if you dont have friends its beatuful game too.. dont compare this game with bf series or cod series its a war simultator. but its not just about war its kind of life simulator . it have s diffrent modes like altislife......",1
"this is the finest and most intense military simulation you could get !!!! the community around is so expended and there are thousands of mods to custom the game to your liking !! i recommend highly !!!",2
"really funny game. just shoot tryhards and watch them get mad.",1
"cti and rpg gamemodes defo worth but only buy if its on sale peace love money",1
"first off, there is not at all as much content as there was in arma 2. now that thats out of the way, arma 3 sports amazing graphical settings, beautiful terrain, and well modelled vehicles, weapons, and everything else. if you want to mess around in the editor, and do god knows what else, arma 2 is where you want to go. if you want to make good missions taking minimal time and effort while still making an experience that sets itself apart from others, arma 3 is the game for you. reccomending this game really dependson how you want to play this game: a pro, or a playful guy who likes to crash a helicopter into his friends. if youre the playful guy, go to arma 2.",5
"i had the lucky chance of playing arma 3 last weekend - which i had to compromise and complete my godlike mission of downloading it. got on a server , got shot in the head in wasteland for missteping into a territory which was 1 meter and amazingly there shot two ppl got ultimate loot and died. 10/10 would fap again.",1
"its pretty intense on the right moments. if you want intense firefights you should play domination.l but if you like to play strategic. you should also play that lol. wasteland on the other hand. is boring as . lots of vehicles planes and helis. you can bomb  and there lots of weapons. 8.2/10 best war simulator of the year -pc gamer",2
"fly a chopper land on tower get blown up die 10/10 game would buy again :steven mcdowall",9
"worst 40 i spent in my life super laggy and i got banned globally for no reason",2
"i bought this game the first day of alpha. it wasnt amazing. if you play it now its a completly diffrent experiance a really good one! i recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of military simulation. even if you are not there are tons of mods, and a very active modding community.",6
"it is finally out of beta! it combines cod as well as battlefield gameplay together. a must have for both parties... its the link between the battle that is raging on...",5
"i played it sometime... just a little... its great i guess... to be more precise the game is an awesome game for you and your friends. theres alot of servers just for you.. if its a zombie game your looking for? join epoch or some other mod about zombies. if its a realistic team playing server? go ahead join one of the great communities out there if you just want to kick some  online? join king of the hill and the game is even moddable theres 100s of possibilities theres alot of opportunities i reccomend this game for the guys who likes the realistic, team play and maybe guys who like competetive",8
"absolutely astonishing gameplay, backed up by a great community. i also highly recommend breaking point (so you can play it with me.)",1
"not bad...could be better if i could find the secret m3lons in it...i was promised m3lons",3
"very good anyone who enjoys arma 2 or one or any fps strategy mmos should get this",1
"best first person shooter i played. i played battle feild alot. but arma is amazing compared to battle feild. i told recommend this game 100%.",2
"drove a car over chicken wire. car broke. 10/10 would drive over chicken wire again",4
"if you have a good computer. and you like in the . buy this!",2
"highly technical, teamwork orientated battle simulation that is showing alot of promise in the early alpha release (currently available). sign up, meet up, own up.",1
"first impression - nice graphs, what i mean it is epic nice, on the other hand, hard to get familiar with inventory, selection stuff, but all in all it is worth price. ....so only few words about this awsome goodness. way better than arma2, if you think your computer cant handle this game. trust me it can, even if arma2 were lagging for you. :)",4
"supported the game in alpha. didnt even get a discount on dlc which is basically an update. dont support this business model. its a great game if you like milsims, try to find it on sale with the dlc included.",1
"why is this even in my library i dont own it. must be from free weekend that happened 20 years ago and steam needs to do more often. anyway, game was fun but it is definitely not worth $60, plus another $18 for dlc. no way. for $60 you could buy two other games, a four pack of condoms, a bag of doritos, a bucket to use while you play games, and still have a bit left over.",1
"liked it but was annoyed by the lack of content compared to arma 2 i love arma 2 but arma 3 is a disapointment compare many features of arma 2 to the lack in arma 3 i like the workshop but i needs more with the base game",2
"hardware requirements are rediculous. i can run most other games well on medium or high visuals. on arma 3 i can only manage to squeeze 9 fps servers lag like  buy it in a decade from the bargain bin. youll be able to run it then",4
"important note to all who are having low fps! i was having concecutive fps of 9 so what i did was add this little thing -winxp to my parameters and now i boosted up from 9 fps to 120 fps! that parameter sets your directx to 9 for the game and gives instant fps boost!",7
"a very fun modern war game! i also really like the mods for the gam.",1
"love this game play it alot and very often worth the money recommend.",5

"spend all your time walking and talking big, get blown up by artillery strike. learning curve to this game simply because it is a war simulator not a run and gun fps.",1

"the best game of the 2010s, i have to admit, it is even better than skyrim. the level of simulation and reality in this game, coupled with the combination of fun and play is amazing. i never thought that a simulation could be this realistic and fun at the same time! must buy, 17/10, absolutley amazing!!! you are an idiot if you dont buy this!",4

"the sound is completly brocken and i cant hear any thing",3
"complicated controlls but not that hard to learn. players friendly and helpfull to newcomers. extremely realistic and fun. its like a tactical, open world version of cod/bf. even more fun for players with existing knowledge of military tactics and jargon. would recommend arma 3 for fans of shooters like cod, cs, bf etc.",1
"there are so many servers out there, that being a new player to arma 3, does not constitute childish behavior of admins, that say that i am being ignorant. for that matter, go have a nice 13year old life. the server ip i would suggest for you to avoid is karmics pve/lift/missions/traderstocked at ip 24.123.11.106:2302. complete lack of social skills that admin had. just because i did not constantly check my side bar, does not make me ignorant. i am still learning this game and i really dont give two  about who runs the flipping server. i only want to have fun, while learning the game, and not be harassed when i log in about reading the mother flippin side chat/bar. for your information, i do read whatever come up in the beginning, just to see if anything important shows up. if not, i just walk or run around and play. i give two fingers up for that server and admin.

"outstanding, my all time favourite military game. its great especially online.",4
"for the money... well no.. this game is worth 10 times less than what i paid for it. actually i have played phone games more exciting than this. my review for arma 3 is simple, i got it on steam sale, i played it 3 times. and its been pretty bad. - the servers cause fps lag (because i get 40fps normally on some servers and others it crawls to 9) - the missions are basically to try and troll people - the maps are big and awesome but theres not many people and whoever you see just kills you - its just boring half the time. so if you like just exploring the virtual map and doing jack all half the time then this games for you. but you could be doing that in the real world and have an extra $30 bucks in your wallet (sale price). decisions decisions..",1

"i stared to play but it was red and blue can you help",1
"the campaign, scenarios and mods are fun and enjoyable. the multiplayer is unplayable compared to most games, though. even some of the best pcs barely get 20fps on some servers. its a known issue with the game and steam should warn buyers who intend to play multiplayer heavily. if you think youd enjoy a war sim in singleplayer then check out this game. if your pc is good and can run this game on high, it looks beautiful. not to mention there are plently of mods that continue to come out. hopefully the mp becomes more stable fps wise through future updates, if possible.",1
"the graphics and lighting on this game are amazingly well done. car headlights actually shine off things like real life, and the sunsets are beautiful. unfortunately, the physics are little more than ragdoll, and the vehicle handling feels like your wheels are actually ice skates and the road is an ice rink. the campaign is pretty boring - the storyline isnt anything special (but to be completely honest, i didnt play much more than 15 minutes since the first level is so damn dull). multiplayer is decent, with life rpg servers dominating the server list. altis life is fun for 4-5 hours, until you realise that theres 5 cars and 10 guns, and money takes the piss to earn because you always get arrested or shot by police/terrorists/annoying  civilians. if you try to join any other servers, especially the ones that have a mission which requires teamwork, you will be very disappointed. the majority of the arma 3 playerbase is now <13 years old (and none of them know how to play as a team - they all want the glory of a kill) thanks to the attention dayz drew to this series of games. overall though, i have to say its an ok game. i dont think the game is worth 35. i also think that the battleye anticheat is . other than that, you will probably enjoy it for a few days at least.",1
"arma iii is a great versitile game that will provide you with hours of fun provided you find the right server. be warned however that it is taxing on even the best of rigs at high settings.",2
"it is very good game for all ages. i will recommend all of you that game, reasons: 1) graphigs 2) story 3) multyplayer i hope you like this game! ;) i do like it :p",1
"i owned the game but now i have to buy it again??!!! this is stupid give me my game or money back!!!!!",1
"its ok, but you will need to spend some time with learning the controls and what everything means, but other then that its a great game with amazing features! this includes: graphics, audio, gameplay, multiplayer, ect... but the game could improve by making it easer for first time players, so if you just want to just get a game and start playing, then this is probaly not for you, but like i said it still is a awsome game!",1
"100/10 a game were anything is possiable. mods were you can see the fish you want to catch , run drugs and sell tortise meat. this game is the only fps were maps overlooking the world are usefull and radios are a nessecity , a great fps if you just want to have array of activities that dont invole you killing or shooting others like mining or picking peaches.",4
"good game, bit of a system hog, modding community makes this a great game.",2
"i got it on sale for 29.99. excellent game. it was definitely worth it.",1
"best game ever i love the series and hope there will be an arma 4",1
"lots of running around, not much action. if you are really into c.o.d. or b.f. you probably will not find this slow-paced game very interesting. on the plus side it does have some of the best weapon, player, and vehicle graphics that exist right now.",1
"i have been playing a lot of wastland servers great fun.",5
"really good game, with a large number of mods! buy it and play it!",1
"revised my review as my last one it was only in alpha, but things have only got better. the possibilitys with this game are almost endless, the multiplayer is by far the most, enjoyable i have played. with so many different game modes, and mods available, you can never get bored. play with your friends and the fun just multiplies. dont get me wrong it has its problems, bugs are still there, and altis can be annoying at times with its lack of cover, but it is a real island, and if they strayed away and changed it, then i wouldnt be altis. the best thing with this game tho is its realism, when one bullet can take you down, and end your day. it adds a fear factor into the game play, where you seek real cover, use real line of sights, and have to make corrections for the ballistics of the weapons. its not for everyone. but any hardcore sim gamer will love this, its still has the arma feel to it, which was something i first thought it would loose. play it. for me, its a 9/10.",9
"best army sim ever love it ! sadly the zombie trend is out cuz dayz stand alone is so much better !",1
"i love this game! so many different ways to play this game whether its a modded rpg or a survival apocalypse this game, in my opinion, is the best game to get if you want to download mods for it.",4
"this game is one of the rare game that has always something new, the community is big and has a lot of modders. you will always find something to do, but i warn you it doesnt run smoothly often and for me this is the only problem. i hope you will consider buying it if you are looking to play for tones of hours and fun! see you on arma!",6
"when i got arma 3 i was a little worried that this game would not be for me. but after putting over 200 hours into the game, i can safely say this game is an amazing video game and highly recommened it to any call of duty players as my self looking for a new way of looking at war games. arma 3 provides so much along the line of the base story, super fun multiplayer games, and also an awesome editor system. some things i suggest doing if you buy this game is finding a group of people to play with. because although this game is great by its self, it is much more fun with freinds. i have met alot of great people on this game that i play with constanly. another thing i suggest you do in arma 3 is try out the editor. you can make some really cool stuff with it. i have made around 6 missions that i can play with my freinds whenever i want to. now i am not going to lie there are some bad things about this game as well. for one multiplayer can get a little stupid sometimes along the lines of, well other players. there is also the glitches that pop up now and again. and if you really want to have fun in this game you better have some good internet connection and a decent computer. but all in all this game is pretty darn good and i highly recommend this game to war game gamers.",3
"i really enjoy this game .. its very intense but makes you appreciate simulators and fpss.. i have clocked so many hrs into this game that i could have completed real basic training. i recommend you get your friends together for a week of infantry training before you try to break your kill streak record .. this is not call of duty prepare for the real thing..",5
"so far i love this game its so real and thats what alot of fps games are missing",1
"the best combat simulation gets better with every release.",1
"solid game with a great deal of features, the avid mil-sim shooter enthusiast will enjoy. there are still a few issues with the game one of which being the lack of easy add-on support and the abissmal vehicle sync between players. i would recommend this game but be warned, this game is not for the faint of heart!",2
"my friend shot me in the foot and left me to die. 10/10 but in all seriousness, arma 3 is a beautiful game and is tons of fun. there is a lot to do with this game, from booting up the editor and having you and a group of friends do a mission, to helicopter flight practice. playing arma 2 with the dayz mod has really gotten me into arma, and i enjoy it.",1
"really nice game make sure that you do have the. recommended specs since if you dont your disk percentage goes 0-100 real quick. no pun intended nice game 100% love it",2

"so worth buying i spend hours in editior creating situations and living them, get this game search armaholic on google and get teh a3mp map pack. you will never leave your pc 11/10",3
"i like this game, it is mostly realistic, no bullcrap, and well set up. because it is a realistic shooter, it can sometimes get boring, but its worth it. i recommend buying this",3
"one of the best games on the market. great graphics, teamwork, and mod support!",5
"great game, loads of mods have come out for it. problem only exists is that its still badly optimized for amd cpus. and to top it off, there is no official mods that add in content, that have been released.",5
"its got nowhere near as much content as arma 2 but with an engine thats leagues beyond arma 2s operate hard a",1
"i find arma 3 hard to play. its single player is though, the ai is merciless and some game mechanics are hard to get under control. but wow, arma 3 really comes to live when you play this game online with other people. there are tons of good, fun servers you could lose yourself in for days. doing missions taking hours at an end, under professional leadership from an hq, pilots, squad leaders and your mates. you get to know them. you dont want to die. you leave no man behind. and after a while, you try to take leadership. and people give you that. the game is though, the community takes that, and owns that toughness by making the rules on yourself as a player though. no lone wolfing, this isnt battlefield. this is a battlefield.",2

"buggy, full of hackers, unless youve got a $4000 rig dont bother.",1
"the downside to this game, only one, you gotta play a lot, to get very good at it. is that a downside?",4
"ya its a great game if you enjoy using the editor. new features with the ability to change stances is very cool. graphics are much improved from arma ii, but this game is not playable on multiplayer. some might say you must have a high spec processor and graphics card, but then why can i play single player with 60 fps on ultra.(i have fx-4170 4.2ghz cpu, r9-270 gpu) multiplayer matches have only the ability to deliver 20 fps which is just unplayable. then people say you must find a good server, but nearly every server is this way, unless i play a small 4 man coop mission which isnt even the selling point of this game. i thought this game was meant to be played on huge multiplayer missions on huge maps but it hasnt gone that way and hasnt been that way since the alpha.",2
"i enjoyed playing this game on the free weekend, but i dont think this game is worth $60. by now it should have dropped a little and arma ii should be free buy now.",1
"car physics, fatigue is pretty dumb. good looking , runs",2
"its boring and you wont know what to do switching back to call of duty s",1
"the worst game in the series. 1 run - 1 screenfreeze. the issue has been reported to bis many times but they do nothing. waste no money! dont buy the game!",1
"i just bought this game last night off steam and my arma 3 wont even connect to the servers or anything. the news feed on the main menu is supposed to say the latest news and . it always says news offline. when i go into multiplayer no servers pop up. i dont have any mods on it. this game is a waste of money. reset router uninstall and reinstalled and even verivyed files and still nothing.",1
"this game is overpriced for the content as compared to arma ii and expect to download mods to get the most out of this game. some problems still exist that were present in alpha. expect to pay for dlc (helicopters) that quite honestly i was expecting to be part of the game. with all the issues it is still pretty realistic and fun to play with friends; however i feel guilty having convinced them to buy the game after its initial release.",2
"a really fun game uses alot of team work and you get to shoot stuff :)",1
"not for the weak hearted. seriosly, i sat on a rock observing for 7 hrs. not fun. overall great game.",1
"extremely fun and has a diverse amount of different game modes",3
"wow let me just say that this is oen of the best games to play if you are a war man, the war i s very eralistic. i got shot in the foot and could not walk for two weeks! wowza",1
"the comunity is constantly produceing new content.",1
"arma 3 really is a great game and is by far the best military sim on steam. the core game itself has good content and a few nice game modes, however the mods such as battle royale and altis life really bring this game to life.",2
"perfect mil-sim game for players looking to use tactics and not run & gun.",9
"this is by far the bast arma game i have play what next for arma who know but i recommend this to all my friend",3
"arma 3 is a wonderful platform for military simulation. where the game truly shines is with the extensive modding community. you will do yourself a disservice if you do not check out any of the multitudes of mods for this title. the game itself with out the mods is a great improvement over prvious titles like arma 2 for example. personally i used to be big on the battlefield series but once i started playing arma it was arma or nothing for my modern day first person shooter. the depth and scope that you can get into here with the combined arms focus is truly amazing. everything fromt he graphics, to physics to sound effects are really good. oh and if you dont want to use the vanilla stuff, again theres mods, even full conversions that bring all the assests from previous games into this one. theres also a really fun multiplayer mode called zues, which is essentially dungeons and dragons meets first person modern day shooter. one player acts like the dm and the others play in his / her world. allowing you to create dynamic ever changing and unique situations on the fly. this one gets my whole hearted thumbs up. for information on how to mod your game, check out this youtube video:",9
"does anyone know how or if you can change your player id? if i reinstall the game will this change or not?",3
"relatively realistic mil-sim. this iteration is geared more towards gamers than simmers, but its still great fun! note: if you have terrible fps/lag while in a server, make sure you are running the same mods as the server or your game will constantly be running into errors in attempt to locate the same mod files (or so ive gathered). i can run at 30fps at max settings in sp but when i join a server without the same mods i drop to 8fps. dont blame your system or the game!",4
"one of the best games i have ever p[ayed i love this game",1
"i have been banned for no reason! i warn everyone out there that if you buy this game, keep a safe and protected account!",1

"fantastic upgrade from arma 2, new lighting, animations and environment to name a few of the updated features make the game a dream. very fluid and vibrant, takes you into a futuristic war set however with the amount of modifcations available time-frame and setting varies. amazing level of access to scripting allows anyone to modify missions and the game in general to a tailored state.",2
"hello im gona review arma 3. its a military first person shooter. this game has a pretty high learning curve with stances weapons modifications and other things. as i said this game is not your typtical shooter where u storm buildings and shoot fast firing guns.in this game u need strategy to complete missions. the guns in the game can kill people really fast so u need to be creative and not run and gunning. there is coop,singleplayer,multiplayer,even a real life altis life gamemode. i would greatly recommend this game but be careful if u havnt played a game before or havnt played a arma at all its gona be hard to learn this so u must spend some hours just to get used to the mechanics.",2
"awesome game played it on the weekend with my friend",1
"i do really recomend the game but the game is meant to be $50. i was looking at the arma website and converted it to usd and it said it was around $50. so would i say its a ripoff... no but i do think that steam should lower the amount. this game is worth it but steam just needs to look at that because i was playing the free weekend and it should have been like $25 dollars. i at that time had $20 so maybe we should ask steam to make a free full edition weekend where you could download it and keep it after the weekend finished...",1

"this is a great game i recommend it to all my friends. reasons why: it is fun !, many possibilities, online gameplay, many updates, cool gameplay, great campains and lot of weapons and cars. fun to play and really sweet graphics! only one thing.... they must make more maps!! stay aswome arma iii !!",4
"spend 3 days hiding in a bush, get shot by someone you cant see. 10/10",5
"just bought it.. already have a good feeling before i even play it..",10
"this game is awesome. a definite buy for anyone interested in realistic military simulations. theres a mod for almost anything annoying you may find in the game which is a huge plus. you can create and edit your own missions. it doesnt get much better than this. if your on the fence about buying it, do yourself a favor, and buy it now while its on sale.",1
"arma 3 is way more than a game. arma 3 has a vast variety of things to do in the game and it gives you an amazing feeling of what its like being in the military. you can fly a helicopter or planes, roll out with a tank or an ordinary car, you can use boats, etc. this game also has amazing graphics and it feels like your in the game. but the best part is the developers. they have made the game way better than when it came out, and they continue to do so. 10/10",1
"arma 3 is an expansive military simulator that excels beyond any game i can think of off the top of my head in both realism and graphics. as a pc gamer it is practically a requirement to get this game (assuming you like fps). it is really fun and is potentially a mix of an fps, rpg and military simulator (with sandbox!) the steam workshop adds tons more content as well such as missions, racing mods, and pretty much anything you can think of...",1
"youre paying 5 more than we did for alpha release. get it if you have the ram.",2
"game is amazing! definetely recommend it to anyone into shooter games although there is a lot of other cool things to do in the game, along with all the fun multiplayer lobbies. makes this game a ton of fun! rated 10/10.",3
"optimization is really bad, but gameplay is great!",1
"this is an awesome game, good grafic, big maps , great sound effects and very realistic game :-d",6

"arma 3 is a very special game. the realism that is blended with the game really brings the game to life. the maps in the game are extremely huge, allowing for people to roam and have great battles. the gamemodes associated with arma 3 show what fun can be had. battle royale is among my favorites, where the game is a hunger-games-like survival competition. there is a variety of vehicles, including aerial and sea. the weapons have many attachments, and some have the unique trait to have tracers. overall, the game is a thrilling experience. 9/10",1
"a true military simulator that looks amazing and plays great when you get a hang of the unorthodox controls.",1
"arma 3 isnt a game about shootin. its about the life of your character its about how long you can strive and live its about flyig its about driveing its about liveing! forget about shooting let your vehicles do it for you....this is what this game is about ladies and gentlemen!",8
"cars in this game are absolutly terrible.. not to mention the mad desync, causing you to crash your vehicles into your friends, and ending any chance of a successful fun game. honestly. too broken.",5
"never buy this game. might be a great game, as all the other arma games were, but battleye likes to randomly ban people so you cant play anymore. i spent at least $80 on all my arma games, and dayz standalone, and because i never played them for a while, i one day get on and i find out that i was perminantly banned from all servers. even after contacting battleye support and bohemia interactive support they both they they cant do anything, even though battleye told me that bi could give me a new copy, and they just deny it. these people just want to steal your money and let you never play the game again.",1
"great military simulator, which will make you play for many hours with all the stuff do. the game looks really good for the huge map, and if you have friends to play with the games fun factor completely changes. you can plan operation and do them with your friends and you will feel like you are actually in the army. (but then you realize you sitting on your chair yelling at your friends through the mic.) everyone should get this game, not just because it is great fun, because it shows true teamwork and co-ordination. hope this helped with your decision :)",5
"quite the army simulator game, i recommend this to anyone who wants a fun time in-game with many options, other then the scroll wheel option being abit weird and something you have to get used to at the start its a very in depth and nice game focused on mechanics and graphics, recommended! :)",3
"the vast amount of game modes will keep me entertained for hundreds of hours and ive only played two of them! altis life is fun and wasteland mode is some of the most intense fps action ive ever played.",1
"about the singleplayer , it comes as a combat simulation mainly simulating various combat situations. now the game is more about the multiplayer. the multiplayer can be scripted which means you can have every mod you want. there are roleplay mods , king of the hill , deathmatch and so on. i would clearly recommend buying the game.",1
"this game is a great expansion on the arma series and is very promising. very realistic compared to other games like bf4, cs:go, and cod.",1
"fantastic! for someone who loves massive maps and blowing  up, this game is #1. the maps are detailed to perfection. the modding is easy as sneezing, with a mod website with new stuff every day. the actual depth of detail in things like damage to specific parts of your helicoptor or different attachments with speed slowing with more weight. there are of course a couple cons. first off: no melee which i can live with but is kind of annoying. second off: if you have a lot of mods installed then its almost impossible to join an online game ( which can be solved my moving mods into a seperate folder but takes forever). even with those cons this is still one of my favorite games to play and would highly recomend it.",2
"some say arma iii is too hardcore, some claim it to be #1 bug simulator, but nevertheless its the most well-made, most realistic warfare simulator. 1. controls there is little difference between the controlls of arma ii and its precessor. however, some changes were made, like controlling your characters position with ctrl.+w/s. it is often mentioned that the game is too hard to play due to its controls, but what else can be done? its a simulator, not an ordinary fps. 2. graphics the visual part of arma iii is also state-of-the-art. various effects like pip (picture in picture), shadows regulation, textures quality will leave you pleased. 3. difficulty level the difficulty is the thing that scares most newbies. its not like cod/bf/moh!, they shout. and they are right. yes, its hader than most fps, but after a week or two you will be playing it like a pro! conclusion arma iii may not be action-driven, it may have some bugs, but its the most realistic war experience youll ever get without the need of going to the army.",1

"great start to a good franchise. cant wait for its launch.",1
"this game is an incredibly realistic and tactical shooter, with the addition of the editor mode, this game becomes so much more. it has its bugs but still they are forgiveable, altis life and battle royal are extremely fun and addicting. a warning before you buy though; practise your skills in the editor before you move onto multiplayer, requires a fairly good pc, make sure you watch some tutorials and gameplay before buying since if you buy this game and find it wont run on your pc, or you some how simpley dont like the game $60 is a fair bit of a waste of money. overall i give arma iii 9/10. hope you found this review helpful!!! =p",6
"yesyesyes - i need this! tried it for the free part and it was awesome! tons of things to do and the showcases were cool, just watch out because its very cpu intensive and is more single-threaded. sorry amd fx cpus",1
"well let our modders add content - this game is the most realistic mod making simulator to date.",3
"i really like this game so far! the optimization really kind of sucks, but there are plenty of guides out there to help you out. definitely pick this game up if youre up for a fun shooter. my only big complaint is that i bought this game for full price, and then it was on sale for 50% off the week after :(",1
"arma 3 is a whole new dimension on military sims. it brings not so far into the future tech with squad based teamwork. even while in alpha / beta this game is great. its another great addition to the arma / operation flashpoint series! 9 / 10",5
"as an army game its lacking, as a game with untold potential its fantastic. this isnt just an army game. when you buy this game you buy a sandbox with unlimited user created content along with endless possibilities. in my opinion this game is worth the money. i havent even scratched the surface of this game and im already hooked.",1
"ive started playing altis life , bought some stuff and a car , and after some time i got killed by a desync.(altis players will know what i mean) 10/10 but avoid other people",3
"very fun, few fps issues, but they dont effect it in a mayjor way. community support is great, developers listen to bug reports. very wide varity of game modes.",6
"it is an ok game(arma 2 is better) but the reason it is not one of my favorites is because of one reason!!! no nudity 3/10",8
"you will either hate or love this game. very customizable and fun.",4
"im not going to pay this money for this game - totally not, you shouldnt. 1st you should get a better gpu, and i mean a very good gpu, arma 3 still needs better optimization. 2nd wait for multiplayer fixes, it still has some desync insues here and there, multiplayer performance needs improvement. 3rd why do i need ot wait for multiplayer fixes when i can play singleplayer? - well arma is made for coop action, and by this i mean join a clan/ group/ unit that knows how to play the game correctly. 4th buy it and you will see it will be worth it!",7
"arma 3 is easy to explain. imagine arma 2. now add proper stances to it, alot better performance, alot of fixed bugs (alot more introduced aswell) and on and on. arma 3 is a good game for what it is. the main problem is: the devs are ing lazy, they didnt bother modelling lots of civillian cars like in arma 2, instead, 4 or 5 that just have different skins. about 1 tank per faction. 3 or 4 helicopters and  me, only one ing jet. i mean thats ing lazy. the amount of content in arma 3 is ing embarrasing compared to the shear amount of content in arma 2. bohemia interactive have done a great job with all the new content etc. but this game should still either be in alpha, or very early beta. not a finished game. overall if your reading this to see weather you wanna get this game or not, its down to you. if you want a game that runs and plays really well, if you can look past the laziness of the devs and the lack of assets, then get it. if you cant however, just stick with arma 2 until the devs actually do something about the lack of assets etc. again, this game should be in late alpha - early beta. not a finished game.",1
"dont even own this game. 10/10 would review nothing again.",1
"the text wasnt showing up in the text boxes. very frustrating.",1
"love the realism this game brings to the 1st/3rd person action genre. recommend to anyone looking to step up from battlefield or call of duty.",1
"arma 3 improves on all the aspects of the previous games. it is a military simulator with more focus on infantry than vehicles. theres still plenty of vehicles and you can drive all of them. the biggest thing about this game is that the most of the content is coming from the community and not the developers. modding is encouraged and missions can be made with an absurd amount of difference with only the in-game mission editor. and your gaming experience is heavily dependent on what kind of mission you play. the games campaign is now fully out and so far its been fun but the story is so and so. all in all its a solid good game that you may or may not like. you die quickly and most of you time might be just spent on getting to the action. so if all you want is action, i suggest you try other games.",4
"if you like your military sims this has to be the daddy! also add mods to your game and obtain even more playability. one game i will recommend to anyone.",2
"all i got to say is ..... blap blap , bang bang ....... boooom, man down ,tis but a flesh wound, lowl, gg developers",2
"i think this game is very good and very very fun really smooth game play and a big improvement compared to arma 2 will have you playing for a good ammount of hours and no boredum",1
"better than arma 2? yes. better controls, more controls, smooth gameplay and framerate, little bit futuristic, better community. top game!",6
"bought it, played it, ran it at 10 fps, still loved it.",1
"the best shooter simulation game to surface that comes to mind, with its realistic mechanics and high quality textures/effects its very easy to get lost in the world that is arma iii. as of this review it still shows a notice on loading screens that the game is in beta although besides maybe pointing at its performance optimization issues feels like a finished product. the pros *stunning graphics and effects *realistic game engine (a slightly improved arma ii engine) *great sound assets and background music *large modding community makes for endless gamemode possibilities *good selection of ground and air vehicles *fantastic player fanbase (full of helpful players and those who like to play the part by using military lingo) the cons *horrible performance optimization on even high end setups ****the recommended specs should be the minimum, if you do not meet the recommended spec then forget it**** *video options is trivial, breaks all logic (better fps with shadows on? wot?)",2
"i have many, many hours of playing arma games but sadly no more. i was playing on battleroyale when i got the massage no player selected and was then kicked. when i logged back in the next day i had a global ban from battleye. be has never replied to a single email i have sent asking for their help. bohemia interactive did but stated they could not help. the upshot is that all of my be enabled games are no longer available and my only recourse is to buy all the games again in a new steam account - not a chance. i am not a cheat. buyer beware on this one. i love arma but will no longer be able to play and will not risk a single penny more until battleye at least have the decency to advise me why i was banned. bi should think carefully about who they work with. ban hackers..yes...but treat people as innocent until proven guilty and at least tell them why they were banned.",6
"i would recommend this game at full price. totaly worth it. i barly know anything about the millitary or fps and i picked it up really quicky. fun to screw around on multiplayer and other gamemodes.",2
"arma 3. one of the games that is just so hard to review because of the many different ways you can go about it. lets just say, i recommend it if you like 30 fps even with a mid to high end pcs. very heavy on cpu and not very well optimised, but its arma. what you get is huge maps. love it.",3
"great game! just needs to fix the damage models as of the 5.56 rounds are like 9mm rounds be nice if they fix that other then that great game! p.s. get battle royale its a mod and its awesome!",1
"with arma, you will either love it or hate it. and if you happen to the one of the lucky ones, arma 3 will keep you coming back for years, with a vast amount of content and replayability, i dont think ive ever experienced a situation the same way twice. with a control scheme that allows for finer movements and positioning and a map that is just oozing with detail. if you enjoyed arma 2 (or arma 1 for that matter) i would spare no time in picking this one up.",4
"massive, massive game with so much community content it is worth purchasing for the mods alone. the series that the ever-popular dayz was created from is now even better with these awesome graphgics and combat making up for the huge amount of travelling needed on the 200sq/km map!",3
"arma 3 is a war simulator but gets used for a lot of other reasons example, wasteland altis life etc but there are a few problems with it as it still just been released example the fps on servers are very bad and i know its not my computer as many other people has complained about it but overall it is worth the $60",7
"a very fun, military game that gets really intense.",1
"the best shooter ive ever played. the realism is immence, campaign is long and has a great storyline to follow it, multiplayer is difficult but spend a few days on it and youll get the hang of it",1
"a game that only exists because of a mod that hardly works for a game that also hardly works, this game also hardly works. overloads most routers",1
"arma iii a game of many things, this will be one of my personal favorites. the game is set on two islands based in the aegean sea, altis a large real life island (limnos in real life) and stratis a small satallite island (agios efstratios in real life). the setting is great with largley mixed enviroments ranging from beutifully desgined housing complexes, dry salt lakes and pine forests this really puts a great game world in perspective. combat is intense and quick paced, forcing you to make split second desicions like do i take out machine gunner who is pinning down our squad or do i kill the rpg trooper before he destroys the tank. this puts some inexpirienced gamers to the test and even the pro can still be the noob. there are many things wrong with arma iii, one of which is it has a feeling of lack of completion to it like it claims to have a wopping 40 wepons when arma 2 had about 60+. the game is buggy and contains many performance issues. the game has only been released for a few months but has gone through alpha and beta phases so the game is not up to scratch as it could be. i would recommend this game to anyone looking for great communitys and someone who is looking for something new.",2
"this game has everything you want when it comes to military simulation and actions. i personally recommend it to anyone who has a passion for war tactics and realism without cutting out the fun. a game that cannot be compared to the rest.",6
"ill change this review if they ever fix the game breaking issues they have right now. if you just want to play single player then you should be fine. if you want to play with friends and actually experience arma with friends then you might as well just walk away now. you have a 50/50 shot at mp actually working for you without the client crashing. no work around, no support. just wait and see if they ever actually finish the damn game.",1
"arma 3 is almost like arma 2, besides alot of gameplay has changed! the guns now have attachments you can take on and off, clotching that you swip out with a dragn drop on. body armor actually works in this game, and mostly everything else does aswell great game overall, i would highly recommend it if you have a beast computer as the maps are huge and eats up your framerate! :)",5
"great game as long as you dont play with hackers! 8/10",2
"very cpu intensive, but great graphics. has many different gamemodes to play. dont recommend buying this game if you have a bad computer. but overall a great game",2
"great game but only really buy to play with friends",1
"this is a great game and well worth the money spent. however, since ive been playing from the begining of the alpha, its not quite as fresh as id like. good on its own, but far better with friends, a dedicated server, and some decent co-op missions. the dlc is not worth mentioning, unfortunately.",7
"this is gonna be est game ever i see you dont make dayz mode for arma 3 but its not gonna happen u create new game for day z u published videos for u are working on arma 3 for dayz you guys said you are going to publish it soon u tricked people",4
"if you want to play the best military simulator experience, arma 3 is your best bet. it has the combat, vehicles, weapons, it has it all. i have played arma 3 for around 300 hours and it is still fun. there are a variety of different game modes that you can play: such as wasteland, which is less serious than others; life servers are for the ones who probably played a lot of darkrp in garrys mod; insurgency and domination, they are also good tactically played gamemodes which are sometimes taken a lot seriously. this game gives the feel that you are the soldier. you are the pilot in that a-164 wipeout. you are the commander of that hunter gmg. survive. adapt. win. lovely game, 10/10.",6
"this is a great game, the developer (bohemia interactive) clearly know what they want to do with themselves and their games. their content is all very high quality, everything from the world, to models, to texture, to most mechanics are all very well fleshed out and realized. for a simulator, this game is astounding, and engaging. imesrion ranges from cod to crying over the death of a squadmate. however! if you cannot quickly find yourself a group or squad to play with, this game will quickly become a bore. my only disapointment is their stubbornnes to not fix the action menu. feel free to watch dslyecxis video for more information. 9/10 if you can find your niche, and if you dont mind the action menu. please do not pick up this game however if you are not a fan of military simulators. are you a cod/battlefield/cs:go fanboy who doesnt appreciate other styles of shooters? this may not be for you.",2
"my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game, ever. were on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. im leading a team of 4 men. we come to a crossroad and i sprint across, telling my men to hold back. i cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. nothing. i run, my saw gunner runs, my medic runs. but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across. anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through? remember the sniper scene? the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down. he then takes two more in the chest. the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. he screams as hes being shot. crawling, drenched in his own blood. sarge? you aint leaving me out here like this, right? i-i wanna go with you guys! cmon sarge, h-help me! cmon! please dont leave me! he died after that. i cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.",3
"this game requires a good pc my pc is a decent pc with a brand new graphics card and it is still struggling a little to run this game but, it is deffinitaly a good game.",1
"rpd as a drug dealer, ran over cops, got arresteed and sent to jail. 10/10 would commit more crimes.",2
"this is a brilliant army based game even better than call of duty",2
"great game 10/10 nice single player i see myself spending a lot of hours on multiplayer with all the great mods.",1
"1-10 fps on medium settings, waste of money and time.  dlc pratices include sniper bipods and helichopter gunner slots.",1
"enough with arcadey nonsense. this is realistic combat simulator. mods are fun.",1
"bought some lsd in altis life, ran from the cops when they noticed purple smoke coming from my truck. and hired a getaway helicopter only to find out i didnt have the helicopter dlc. i got arrested and went to jail for 1:10:00 minutes. the guy in the helicopter tried to break me out of jail. i only then realized that u cant get in copilot if u dont have dlc. i am not a wanted fugitive and have 3 bounties of 10million on me. 100/10",2
"if you like tactical military simulation genre, buy this, try to explore arma world like altis life, wasteland, and many more cant stop play without it 11/10",6
"good game ..high price..would say the price is worth it but seing how the game is imo beta still..its a damn good game modded.and worth the play time",2
"this game is a very good game with lots of expansions graphics are great",1
"its arma, not call of duty or battlefield or halo or whatever... its simulation, so no 360quickscope, no gender-related bashing, no noobs vs pro to a certain degree, simply one of the best simulations game in existence. its basically a military simulations, with multiplayers and good gameplay, with multitudes of community mods. with massive content created by community, you buy this game, you could play more than just 1 game. yeah, wanna play the sims? arma 3 have it. wanna play tank battle? arma 3 have it. wanna play ace combat? arma 3 have it. wanna play racing games? arma 3 have it. wanna play... oh come on, try them for yourself! im not paid to write long review, so im gonna leave it here. oh, and zombies... hehe, whats better than playing zombie in arma themed world? download a zombie mod, use a script to spawn tank, and have fun!",4
"arma 3 is so much more than you expect. the amount of free content for this game is staggering.",2
"so for some reason, i have an i5 4670k with 4 gb gtx770, and i get 15 frames per second no matter what. when i first got the game, it was fine, but a few updates ago, it went to hell. one of the top voted issues on their feedback tracker is that the game does not utilize your computers full power thats been on there since march. their feedback tracker is more like that broken down suggestions box you see at a grocery store, hidden away in the corner, covered in cobwebs, and forgotten. maybe a janitor might see it one day. probably not.",4
"trained combat operators with the cardio of obese 3rd graders. 11/10.",1
"im really enjoying arma 3, i suggest and recommend highly!",1
"broken multiplayer + horrible singleplayer campaign = bohemia interactive. thanks guys.",1
"i can be an elite soldier with a big  gun while wearing nothing but my underwear.",1
"tried it out on free weekend. cant stop playing. who needs sleep when you have arma 3?",1
"besides the fact your enemies turn into slender man everytime you shoot them, this game is by far best arma besides combat operations and arma 2 but graphics do matter cause in low settings on arma 3 is like medium on arma 2. also this game is very futuristic in a way the csat are the closest thing to the modern day terrorists and the aaf are your greek resistance the only modern thing in this game is nato they use commanche helis, mraps, ghost hawks, and who ever is wondering whats a ghost hawk? it was the prototype heli used to transport the navy seals to kill osama. finally the game modes are crazy fun like escape from stratis and they have steam workshop so you can download missions instead of making one your self they also have pvp but due to desync it wont be as fun as playing coop with friends. the campaign in this isnt like the one from previous armas its more dynamic it tells the story of how nato is being attacked by aaf and the csat i wont spoil anything because this is a review not the campaign",6
"game is poorly optimized. dont buy it. waste of your money!!!",1
"this game is worth every cent. it is extremely realistic and has provided hours of fun for me and my friends.",1
"if you liked arma 2 you will like this game. if you havnt played an arma game, i would definatly recomend watching a few videos to see what its like. personally i would give it a 9/10.",2
"the game does have some pretty minor glitches but other than that arma 3 is a great game for community development. devs out there create some pretty fantastic mods and addons for the games because of the huge open world maps and functions bohemia interactive provides in arma 3. many people buy this game just for the amazing addons to the game which allow very unpredictable scenarios to happen. arma is intriguing to me because the game is unpredictable. games that are unpredictable are more of a way for players to choose how they play and gives a slight immersion. there can be scenarios where you see a heli crash onto a building which is 100 meters away and that building had one of your best soldiers now knocked out waiting to ambush the enemy who is surrounded with opfor. what do you do? arma is fantastic because its your choice of how you want to play the game where other games have straight up orders to do stuff, why would you want to do that? i would give this game a 9/10",5
"feels like i wasted my money. game looks beautiful, but it got too frustrating when it felt like everyone else was going on with the mission and combat, and i was left looking around for the enemy. outisde of waiting for some tracers to show up and give the enemy away, my efforts to eliminate my target were futile 99% of the time. id use up all my ammunition, and theyd land in a perfect shot, every single time. it got to the point that i would end up sitting back while the ai on my team took care of it- after all, they knew exactly what to do while im just sitting there shrugging my shoulders. this is not your typical combat fps. the controle are wonky, and i spent a hard-earned $60 on frustration. i have a titan video card. it runs all of my games on maximum settings flawlessly. with arma 3, it seems like all i do to ajust the graphics settings makes no difference, as im hit with major framerate issues. after a few days, i reinstalled the game to give it another chance, but i just couldnt get anything accomplished. i personally dont recommend the game.",1
"teflon was wrong, this game is awsome. highly recommend.",2
"other than the fact that bohemia has to yet add bipods and ieds, which i find quite lame and  because they are basic concepts to a sim shooter(i shouldnt have to put a trigger down for a proximity ied, should work just like a mine). luckly their are mods and the game is very fun once you get used to using mods. playing this game with a group is a must as the ai are not the greatest on pathfinding, but are fully capable of sniping you across the map. arma has a great modding community and tries to cover for bohemias shortfalls and does a great job. in game mission editor is very similar to the arma ii mission editor, but the modules system helps it stand out. it gives you hints on how to use the modules and doesnt rely on you having to put in a bunch of scripts. however you still can use scripts for greater flexablity. i will personally be wasting more hours on this game.",3
"if you are looking for a realistic military shooter this is the best one on the market",5
"fun for those who love a challenge and have the patience. a great shooter for those seeking something a little more realistic. cannot play like cod.",2
"brilliant game but be sure to buy it on  as its really to exspensive for what you get. what you do get is a brilliant campaign, top of the line graphics. weapons, sounds, vehicles and the map are very well done! multiplayer is fun and easy to make friends on e.g (altis life) workshop includes a ton of content and mod support is crazy into-depth. i get lost in the maps theyre that big. however, this game is hard to run making expensive graphics cards seem like your entry cards, that may be a beta thing but you definatly wont have 60 fps unless you have a gtx titan. overall i reccomend this game 8/10 hours of fun",1
"this game is legit and amazing. the devs try not to call it a sim but its as close as you can get while still being a game. its very realistic with damage and weight models. body armor and helmets give a degree of protection. the same applies to the variation of vehicles in the game. the 2 maps are huge and there are plans for dlc in the future which will no doubt add on to that. speaking of addons the giant mod community for the game is always hard at work making new missions, weapons, and vehicles to add into the game free of charge. there is endless replayablility with this game and if youre a shooter/military game fan then this should be in your library. honestly, if the game was more optimised (insane cpu usage for projectile physics and ai decision making) i wouldnt even play half of the other shooters that are out today because arma does it all and more. pick this game up!",6
"this is a great game for strategists and military sim people and would recomend to those with a strong affection towards realism.",2
"the greatest game i have ever played, if you are looking to go in the military or currently in the military this simulator is for you. even if you are not in the military but love the armed forces this game teaches alot reading maps, combat skills, etc.... this game was made by the best for the best.",1
"although i cant get past the first checkpoint, or get a single kill in the first 2 hours, dont let the difficulty baffle you as there is a lot more out there that meets the eye. not only does arma iii offer you a ginormous sandbox openworld map, it gives you a range of choice between vehicles, weapons and body gear. the intense graphics allow magnificent details which give you the best experience possible of what its like being out in there in the field. as you slowly immerse deeper and deeper into this game, past reminiscences of other fps shooting games from series such as the call of duty and counter strike will fade. however there are still some noticable glitches and bugs but these defects barely affect your gameplay and only give the creators more urge to make this game even more fantastic than it already is. the arma series has really opened the gates to a bridge that connects man to virtual reality and i highly recommend people to buy this game as it is a should buy -- no, must buy game on the steam store.",1
"i pre-purchased this game before it even came out and here i am nearly two years later and this game is just terrible... arma 2: oa is much better. arma 3 is not terrible neccesarily becuase of the gameplay, i want to add its terrible becuase it just runs absolutly horrible on my computer for some reason i have no idea why... i can never get above 25 fps.... i have an amd fx cpu (8 cores @ 4.0 ghz) and an nvidia gtx 770 gpu... why does this game run so horribly bad?? dont tell me its cause i have an amd processor because that is not a valid excuse. even 2 years later this game is $60 and another $16 if you want two extra helicopters? its ridiculous! this game had potential to be a great successor to arma 2 but it just falls so short it isnt as fun, its runs terribly so i just cannot recomment it to anyone. another side note, i dont know if this is because of the low quality settings i have to use...but, the sky always seems like it is soo bright and washes out detials so bad arma 3 just look terrible. im so very disapointed in this game.",1
"great game.gives you that original war feeling.for those who are interested in tactical gaming this is the game for you.",1
"awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",3
"fun game, very in depth if felt for an fps. you should have patience for some servers though, they will be figuring out which line you should stand in more than they will be doing stuff. if you like planetside 2 for the organization or players, this game will be fun for you.",1
"very good military sim, unique campaign and highly entertaining multiplayer. gr8/8 m8",3
"one of the most realistic games and best game ive played",1
"this game is just wonderful, it is beautifully done, very good and magnificent. it is a bit hard to play, but not as hard as arma 2. so i recommend this game for everybody and seriously, you should rather buy arma 3 than arma 2. :d",1
"so basically... its the best game ever made ever. the game is my picture....buy it.",5
"easily the best small island simulator ive ever played. loads of trees and flies!!!",1
"ultamate badasery if you know your millitary tactics and love simulation at the most harcore it can get on a expansive open world island this is the game for you",1
"i realy like this game, iv been wanting a game like this for a while, its like the audio from dayz but beter and the graphics are on ultra and run perfect on my computer my favourites modes would be roleplaying in the arma 3 life its fun when your a cop mostly i like being an innocent and then smuggle guns throughout the world anyways 10/10 happy to have gotten this game for 39.99 aud it was only 29.99usd now its 59.99usd but anyways its still totaly worth it",1
"arma 3 is not quite a first person shooter, it really is more of a war simulator overall. it is highly detailed and looks great visually but there can be a bit of a learning curve. the games strong point, in my opinion is the way it tries to do multiplayer, where you make missions and what not. i find this single feature what makes arma stand out the best. more shooters should have the level of control arma 3 gives players. there were a few cons to all of its pros though, so i will list my biggest as follows. 1. multiplayer servers (if not set up properly and efficiently) can make the game squat down and take a huge dump on your fps (frames per second) 2. i feel the multiplayer user interface could use some work. making the game more accessible to new players. 3. better single player. arma may be best for its multiplayer but i think overall more work could be done making the single player experience more enjoyable. all in all i think arma 3 does the shooter/ war simulation best, it may not be as popular as games like cod or battlefield but thats not a bad thing. imagine if it was that popular, then we would be dealing with those guys...",1
"i would recommend the game as played with friends. campaign alone for example is ing pain in the . the ai companions are  and enemies seem to be at most points superhumans. i mean they aim ridicilously well and they see even the slightest movement in a bush from one click away. i mean, seriously? then you drop player alone in the middle of these superhumans. fun, eh? well yeah, if your ing physics would actually work and the forest and bushes would actually cover something. i played opf series from the start and arma series from the start, but this campaign and the ai in it is the absolutely worst. but in the other hand when played with friends (with a lot of frieds) it is a good game. player versus player massive multiplayer matches are fun. their little ing  campaign is not.",3
"what can i say its a great game. the communitys good, lots of fun, massive levels, real shooting simulater :) i recommened medium settings even to people with top spec pcs. my only down side to this game is optimisation. apart from that you get hundreds of hours out of this game lots of content and it deffenatly takes the cake for me over cod and battlefield. 9/10",1
"if you expect to run this game at good framerates on nvidia cards, it is more than likely you will be tweaking the settings to almost nothing before getting at least 30fps in campaign matches!",1
"it will take about 20-30 hours of playing single player to figure out how arma works. then once you go online, you will spend another 10 hours until you really start enjoying it. but once you get into it, there is nothing like it, and it will be the most amazing game you have ever played.",1
"arma but genuinely fun rather than something you put up with because its the only thing like it. this is great.",1
"realy good game, lots of gamemodes and lots of rp servers. the downside of the game is that it has fps problems, but some times it not the game but the gamemode if you play a 70 player rp server then yeah the fps sucks but if you play a deathmatch with 20 player (like battle royal,its a mod ) its not that bad. and it has a lot of nice workshop content. 10/10 would like to kill some one again !",5
"not the same, some might like the futuristic appeal but i dont.not yet.",3
"realistic. and sometimes not realistic, but its a simulator so whatd you expect. go kill a bunch of people and make a ton of money racking up your war crimes only to realize hours later none of it was real. kinda like playing a game all day huh?",5
"arma 3 is a very good game and i like the graphics and all the mods you can play.the sounds are very realistic and the game s very realistic.i know the game have some bugs in it but is not a waste of money,its a good product.i payed that amount of money and now i enjoy. 9/10 very good job guys.buy this game!",1
"as of this point no. too many bugs and crashes. also everytime they seems to make a update to the game they just seem to add more bugs.",1
"this game is nice, i like vac, i like vac bans. i  yo sister in bed, she number 1 prostitue in kazakhstan!",1
"arma 3 is a masterpiece that i think will be played for a a long time! this game has beautiful graphics of terrain and objects. gameplay mechanics are quite easy to learn but becoming a master takes time and practice, you maybe able to kill from 100 meters but you will have to train to kill at 1000. there are a wide selection of weapons and clothing for your charicter, ranging from ghille suits to civillian clothing. where i think this game shines is the scale of combat, with two absolutly huge maps and combat scenarios arma will never give you the same scenario twice! this isnt any arcade shooter, arma is a tactical shooter, some would even call it a role-playing game! summary: buy this game if you have a moderatly powerfull pc!",2
"bought new 4000 rig just to play. runs at sub 30fps on medium settings. 10/10",1
"game is cool 20 minutes at a time when its not losing connection or having my steam ticket fail what ever that means, when they fix this pos should be an awesome game.",2
"this game will leave you in tears of how awesome this is!! 10/10",1
"10/10! absolutely love this game. almost so much, im eventually going to upgrade my computer, that means paying about 1,000 euros or more just so i can get this game on highest specs looking amazing! if youre an arma fan than youre going to love this.",7
"abosolute must! this game is so fun in so many ways! you should definitely try it!",10
"jumped out of a chopper under heavy enemy fire, ran to a bush and hid, crawled to a rock for better cover, steadied breathing, eyes on enemy infantry through sniper sights, b*****d started running through woodland obscuring view, turned on infrared sights, accounted for gun sway and bullet drop, boom...headshot! 10/10",4
"i really need help my game wont play anymore cause of a error and i deleted what it told me too and it still wont work please help me:(",2
"seems like a fantastic sim, and for people who like sims, i could see the appeal. but i struggle to find the fun in the game. i was really terrible at it which makes this review biased. the reason i dont recommend it is because i dont think the average guy would have fun playing, so why drop the 60$ unless you like a realistic and challenging war sim. i rage quit within an hour.",1
"large improvement over arma 2, still needs work tho in my humble opinion. and optimisation! rolling it on a mid range system produces less than playable results exactly when you need it to run smoothly the most: multiplayer firefights. theres something inherently wrong with the way you program your game engines guys. probably make a better game engine, one that handles all the stuff it ha to do in a smart way, so you dont need a top of the line pc to play on medium quality! all in all, its worth buying. not going to improve much in the areas it suffers, because they are tied in with the game engine, but as technomogy catches up, it will be fun to play the mods people are making for this, just like dayz was... without the cheaters hehe. props to rocket for that one, but dayz standalone is still a total fail...",1
"very fun and immersive tactical shooter, if youre looking for a good game that is more acturate to real-life combat, the arma series is for you.",6
"the most impotant thing i can say about arma, you will never see something like in any other game. you may some wonderful strategic games, awesome first person shooters with 99% of epic scenes and 1% of shooting, flight simulators and games about tanks only, but you will never see all this stuff in one place, of course, if you still dont have arma iii. allright, some fans can even remember the first part - cold war assault, but... well it looks like that, but has unique graphics, physics, new vehicles and story. but, however, arma iii is a technically great game, but the most important thing in it will always be the gameplay with all its unique fetures. so, hell yes, i recommed this game to everyone, who wants to see the real combat and wants to find him or herself in a new military world for next eternity. goodbye, ladies and jentlemen, i am going to play arma. p.s.: pardon my russian :p",1
"no offence to anyone that likes this game, but i had a terrible and i mean terrible experience playin this game i was glitchy af online and scenery wise is... extemely lacking and most populated servers are the atlus servers and they arre mostly deserts with some buildings here and there.... overall i would give this game a 7/10 (effort is what got you the 7). the singleplayer is really good but mltiplayer is very lacking. im glad i didnt pay full price for this but im disappointed in myself for buying it at all to be honest.",1
"played the free weekend, flew an attack helicopter in the showcase menu, slightly pressed w, my entire helicopter went face down while 30 feet in the air, i pressed shift + s to slow it down while bringing it up, it pulled up insanely fast, saved myself, but at the cost of the life of an ai, you will be missed, george.",1
"a futureistic shooter with i high learning curve and a very active community.",1
"was playing battle royale and as the plane crashed into a city everyone screamed allahu akbar and other racist terrorist . ing amazing",2
"arma 3 is a military sim junkies dream. you can create any scenario you want. the best missions to play are those that you can download from the community created content. the game is a wip with ongoing iterations. best part is the multi-player experience. worst part is the ai experience.",9
"storyline is  (like every time) but multiplayer experience has no end. i love the editing in this game it gives you so many options. alot of community made missions are the most played by everyone like wasteland, altis life, etc. i also love it so much cuz its set on my country :3",1
"the only game capable of giving the player authentic military warfare - atmosphere. you owe it to yourself to at least try it! full recommendation.",2
"its now all about rpgs and dayz singleplayer after 2 years still bugged if you want tactics go to aa",1
"makes cod, moh, battlefield, and every other modern-themed quasi-military game feel like rubbish. the simulation is fantastic, the realism is unmatched, and the gameplay is stunning. i was stunned by the alpha release: it was like nothing id ever played before. then the full release came around, and i was even more impressed. there are a few downsides to arma 3, dont get me wrong. the control layout learning curve is extremely steep, to run the game at maximum graphicical settings requires a very beefy set of hardware, and some of the servers suck. but, and this is a big but, if you are looking for realism, look no further. if you cant do something in the base game, i guarantee there is a mod somewhere to make it work. another plus is the community; because the learning curve coming in is so steep, it weeds out a vast majority of the 12-year-old cod crowd that we mature gamers love to hate. in closing, i highly reccomend arma 3, but be warned: it is not for the casual gamer.",1
"this is not just a game, but one of the best investments you could ever make in your life.",1
"totally worth it. but i will wait for the price drop again. untill then arma 2 :)",1
"great game;unlike the other  sims...my only problem with the game is that its fremerate is around 30 fps on multyplayer.by the way,my pc is pretty damm powerfull.",1
"youre either going to tear your hair out, or be hooked in the first half hour.",1
"when its not glitching, its a great mil sim with a good engine. 15/10",5
"not a very good game, impossible to find a legitimate game online.",1
"arma 3 & dayz r not just a normall games to play , its a life to live .",7
"for just $15.99, you can now get the helicopters dlc, which includes, for that one low price, just two helicopters ! ! in addition to this awesome deal, you get to shoot from vehicles, which should have been in the game in the first place ! order now and well double your offer. **just pay separately for core game mechanics.",5
"good game more of a simulator though overall worth buying for 20",2
"great game. would be great with more weapons and a useable bipod. controller support is great; just a few button maps dont seem to work. awesome game overall. 9/10 would eat.",3
"if you were looking for a tacticool military shooter that is going to take hours out of your life, look no further, for you have found your game. arma 3 includes: -sleek helicopters -guns of the future -x-ray visioned ai -sleek tanks -an oversized flat map -an undersized hilly map -good multiplayer -and more! squeakers may appear on weekends.",5
"love the game would like a dynamic campaign to be included",1
"best milsim out there yet. truly recommend it! great game for those interested in teamwork play and so on :d",8
"nothing is better for any military type game. this is very configurable and highly recommended by any player who has played it. give it time and you will be hooked and stuck to it. make sure you have a high end pc. game comes with plenty graphics and high use of cpu. enjoy it and join for something that will be put in history of game servers!",5
"this game has so many bugs its rediculous realistic right if you could only get ur fps to actually b any good horrrible dont waste ur money on a game where they never gave a  in the first place.",5
"great game especially the altis life! arma is the type of game that puts fps, rpg and etc. all together and smashed into one great game!!!! best game ive ever seen!",3
"too advanced, and teamates will ditch you constantly. also many framerate issues.",2
"get some friends  around what else could you do in a war sim. i first have to say after playing some time on this game that it is won the 10/10 for me the sounds graphics gameplay i have nothign else to say that the face you can get in with friends and kick bad guy  together is the best its a way to pass time. msi give it a 10/10!",3
"if you liked arma 2, you will love this even more.",2
"do not buy this bugged out peice of . its good idea but badly executed.",1
"campaign is a 4/10, multiplayer/mods are 10/10. essentially all the player created stuff is 1000x better than the  bohemia made.",1
"arma 3 is not a game you should pay $60.00 for. the game does indeed offer a few nice features but it does not offer the good, realistic, and tactical gameplay you would recieve from arma 2",5
"yes, yes, yes....... great game to play with your friends. it has a lot of variation.",4
"while i love the arma series, this game was not was i was expecting. when you make a game, you have a couple things that need to be set up to make it a game. 1. a setting - they created the island, and it was good, very large and open with a diverse landscape 2. the engine - everything works well, even the physics, which arma 2 completely failed at. movements are fluid, you got way better animations, so there arent any complaints....until 3. weapons and vehicles - this is one of the most crucial points to add variety to a game, and i am sad to say that bi failed miserably. they created virtually nothing for the games release, for what reason i dont know, but it aggravates me to no end. you have all the things in place, the tools for people to make their own missions, but there is no variety, same guns, same ammo, and a couple of vehicles. look at arma 2, even without the dlc, there was tons of content to work with, and the dlc just added onto that. my advice? keep up to date on the status of the game, and once the first dlc comes out, then buy it",1
"i recommend this game if its on sale, but if it isnt, its not really worth 49.99 euro. but its still fun andreally great looking.",1
"buggy as  but amazingly good fun with mates. 10/10 would get into an aircraft and spontaneously combust again.",2
"you either love this game or you hate it. if you like games with military tactics and guns and stuff this is the right game for you.",1
"looted the corpse of my fallen comrade and took his sunglasses. 10/10 respec for your fallen bredas.",2

"i wish i had the money to buy this game :( its so fun!",1
"bought this game 1 year ago afther i build my own game pc one of the best games i have ever purchased there are so many diffrent mods you can have fun in like the all new overpoch from arma 2 now in arma 3 :d wasteland,battleroyale and all the hours of playing altis life and being a good civi or a cold blooded criminal the wrokshop is a good place to find some awesome singleplayer mission or co-op missions to do with your friends still love this game afther 1 year 10/10",2
"awesome game, even more of an awesome group of devs. this game is amazing compared to arma 2. arma 2 was too clunky, i couldnt even run it. yet somehow i can run arma 3 even though it has way more advanced graphics and features. i really recommend this game while it is on sale.",1
"sucks since i cant play on any of the online servers. i have the same problem with arma ll. i would highly suggest this game if everything was just one simple download, but its not. i tried getting arma 3 and arma ll to work  welll as the dayz mod and i have had no luck.",1
"amazing game! alot of different community made gamemodes available.",1
"the quintessential first person military sim for the seasoned military shooter fan or first-person shooter players looking for a bit of depth and substance in a game. this aint arcadey casual rambo cod or battlefield rubbish folks. this is the real-world modelled experience every fps player *should* be looking for. and if you havent been... you need to take a long hard look in the mirror and tell yourself to lay off the drugs.",2
"brandon is silly for not buying this game. its a fun game. you can go diving, who doesnt want to go diving.",3
"the arma series is excellent, bi knows how to treat their fans!",4
"this is my first time playing this game... lots of good reviews , but the storyline is a complete . i cant cope and understand what they try to reach the story upon us... i got high hopes when i bought this game, but frankly a dissapointment.",1
"least user-friendly game i have ever played (or attempted to play). if you are an online gamer, good luck figuring out how to join a server. after spending over an hour trying and failing to play multiplayer, then searching google for a tutorial, its very obvious why this game will never succeed: its impossible to join any multiplayer server. stick with games made by professional developers and avoid this wanna-be bs crap",1
"unable to play with my friends in co-op. we could play on public servers together though (by joining them manually) but we couldnt play on servers created by one of us. we tried several tricks with firewalls and opening ports, connecting directly to server ip - doesnt work. maybe we actually could fix this on our own but were not with freaking nasa. bohemia probably thinks theyre very special cause i cant imagine why in 2014 i should freak myself out to find a way to play with my friends. i mean, its not even dark souls. game is great by the way, but its a special one. its not bf for sure .",2
"best military simulator out there. its still clunky as hell like arma ii, but we still love it anyways.",2
"awesome multiplayer game, but not always very good optimized.",1
"this is probably the first game that ive played that actually had people working together. joined a 40 player co-op server where everyone communicated with eachother and coordinated movements between squads. 10/10 would buy again",1
"game looks amazing, feels realistic but there in is the problem, the game is not fun when it becomes so frustrating because the game has been over complicated to be fun, its a shame could of been a perfect game.",1
"the life servers/mods can make you spend way too many hours infront of your pc. if you like i bought arma ii first, arma iii is just an perfect sequel. 10/10 -xar",3
"i got this game thinking it would not even be worth my 22 euros. but hell i was wrong, another great game in my library if i get bored.",1
"pretty basic until you get mods for it. find a good community of gamers who game regularly and with good mods and this becomes one of the best games youll ever buy. im going to fail my degree because of this game. 10/10",7
"an amazing games that will entertain you for a while, and the mods make the content on this game endless.",2
"game is ok and all but if you expect it to be realistic then you are wrong have fun emptying more than half of your mag into a guy 50m away and he lives",2
"a better looking version of arma 2 with little about that game fixed. steep learning curve. better tutorial this time. ai has aim hacks. you will watch as your team cant hit the broad side of a barn while the enemy ai can nail you with one bullet from 1500 yards. too frustrating to really continue with campaign.",1
"this is the greatest tactical game ive played other games in this genre none of them can compete with arma 3s huge map and amazing graphics while having amazing gameplay.",1
"arma 3 is a great game,if you kown how to enjoy it",1
"great game, great graphical infrastructure and great team play. this game has it all. with modding available in the workshop, you can create your own war. if your a fps fanattic, this is the war game for you! online is just as fun :)",2
"after the update with the launcher arma and bisudio can go to in hell i uninstalled the game and hope they burn up in hell",8
"from what i played of it i had a ton of fun especially in the multiplayer, it was all out chaos and i couldnt stop laughing i had a cop strip down and run into the ocean while firing his gun in the air and then someone drove their truck into the water and killed him. 1510 -ign",1
"i got lost in the middle of the ing desert and got electrified by zeus with dead clones of me by my side. 10/10 best game since go! go! nippon: my first trip to japan.",1
"yep so i have played 100hrs+ great game - still as good now, if not better then when i was first new to it. only thing i would say is dlcs would be nice if they where free, but i can get over that",2
"solid graphics, but too many issues.. 1. swaying is extremely unrealistic, your character literally sways his gun so much it could be considered an arm excercise <.< 2. enemy skill is unbelievable.. they can literally shoot you from 200 yards away with iron sights while you are slightly out of cover prone (lowest enemy ai settings applied) 3. after shooting an enemy, their bodies bend like the bullet applies an incredible amount of force 4. squad ai and ui is so wonky that i would rather just follow than lead.. 5. it doesnt feel rewarding to complete missions, its like i accomplished nothing i am only recommending this game because its challenging and visually exceptional. however, if you are looking for a game that isnt extremely frustrating at points this isnt for you. i really hope these issues are resolved..",1
"i really like this game but i only got to play it for the weekend i just dont have money to get it im not that welthy i wish someone could buy it for me but no one will so geuss ill have to save up for it d:",1
"it is usually fun but sometimes people are like way to srs on it and pretend it is irl amd that can be annoying.",1
"its a good game, the test on the weekend was great",7
"this game is amazing! it might not be as complete as arma 2 but it is nonetheless fun and fixes some problems arma 2 had problems with. over all, its a brilliant game that will become more and more complete over time :d",3
"endless fun with huge gamepaly improvements over arma 2.",2
"20/10 would get lag but still enjoy it everyday plus many game types increases the load of fun things to do",4
"arma 3..... a fun and immersive experience.pros: great graphics, immersive, great editor, awesome mp, and 4 factions to play as, fia nato aaf csat. cons: a few minor balencing issues, and is not optomized to well. 8.3/10",4
"bought the game - have been terribly unhappy with the slow rate of updates, the unoptimized graphics engine, and general lack of content. an open world with very little in it - not very much fun at all.",5
"great game overall with a great modding community!",1
"this is crazy !!!! best game ever but you nned a decent computer i got a msi and i play the game on ultra (the max) at 25-35 fps that is the playable fps",9
"this could be a great game but is way too demanding....my pc beats the minimum requirements and still runs laggy no matter the setting even on the lowest settings its still bad,,,,,dont buy unless you have a high performance pc or it will be a waste of money. keep in mind what ive described above was on solo/single player, online is much worse even if its a dedicated server. dont click the buy button you have been warned",7
"43 hours of getting to the battlefield and 1 hour of getting shot and dying, great military sim.",1
"ive played many hours on this game... and the singleplayer sucks... the only thing that kept my hopes alive was the multiplayer. and my hope. is still in this franchise",4
"awesome fun if you have friends to play with and you are able to run it smoothly.",3
"when do u get rid of your global ban i did have it over 1 years and 4 months",4
"look at the hours^^ do i need to say more? its hard to learn tho so be prepared!",5
"very hardcore game for anybody who likes mil sims as much as i do, although, if you are nto used to the arma series i do not reccomend it to you, there are so many controls to remeber but you can still learn them! def a 10/10 game",3
"one of the best games ive purchased without regretting it in the end. a+ modding community, great looking graphics, and hundreds of sandbox hours clocked already! not to mention the already available content is amazing! 8/10 i gave it an 8 because the sound design and particles need work. i would have loved to see a more complex and more realistic sound, physics, and particle engine. the lack of proper vehicle and ragdoll physics is something this game really needs to get right. sure it has physx, but its not enough... thanks for a great game, b.i. and modding community!",4
"probably the most played game that has this many bugs... though the huge variety of community servers with custom gamemodes, and a really enthusiastic playerbase, makes this game great! especially with a friend or two, roaming wasteland to gear up and fight other passerbyes",1
"this game, its shrek. and shrek is love shrek is life.",2
"a very good game enjoy playing king of the hill which is a really good multiplayer mode also like the wasteland mod. if you are bored of the same old shooter like cod and bf then get this but there is a very big learning curve for new players but if you wait it out and keep at it the game gets loads better. also the moddng community is massive for this game and if you get bored there loads of new mods to choose from 9/10 would be 10 but im still not good enough and sometimes the ai getts annoying because they are good and i get killed a lot but to be fair thats my fault.",1
"one of the best simulation game great ambient so immersive & the other mod just special i recomanded battle royal , you need absolutly try this mod incredible experiences..",1
"great game for anyone looking for a realistic war game. probably the closest thing youll actually get to shooting people. 10 potatoes/10 mushrooms.",1
"this a a great game for some one who likes combat games, but wants a realistic system. i fully injoy playing this game. i think that it has somthing that everyone likes. people can make their own mission host their own games and even modify the game if they want to. if you like simulators like minecraft and also like first person shooters i recommend that you get this game.",2
"undescribably amazing, the best experience of any pc game, in my opinion. this military simulator can be turned into virtually everything, through addons, and simple mission scripting.",7
"playing wasteland in arma 3 is alot crazier the it was in arma 2",2
"difficult to master but awesome to play. realistic army sim.",1
"the new age has arrived, imagine playing a dayz mod that doesnt eat  out of your cpu....it does exist friends, and arma 3 is its base. get it.",1
"get it and play it enjoy it. it is alpha and it will have annoying bug or something weird.",4
"my favorite game ever! altis life,breaking point",5
"children play call of duty boys play battlefield men play arma 3",1
"i bought this game in the steam summer sale 2014 for a few euros ( 22.45 euros ) and i havent been disappointed since then. in addition i just can say that the graphics are awesome and that the mods ( f.e. : altis life ) are funny. sure no game is perfect so this game has also a few bugs here and there, but it is its money worth! well playing guys.",1
"great war simulation game ! i recommend it to all people who loves real action combat, but you might need a decent config for it.",1
"this is a great game hours of fun i played the altis life mod great will recommended to anyone",4
"arma 3 is a great game but isnt as good as arma 2 (in my opinon) this game has lots of bugs and glitches. arma 3 looks good but it needs a great pc to run smoothly. sa-matras wasteland is amazing and id recommend it",1
"if you like dayz kinda action, and you are willing to rpg. altis life mod for arma 3 is verry cool, look up a good community and get your life going. get a job: pick apples, peaches, mine for iron, copper, salt and even diamonds. become a criminal, and pick, process weed, cocain or heroin. become a cop, arrest ppl. search vehicles, and hunt people that have a price on their head. you can even become a rebel. before you get a life on a server, read the rules of a server, the rules may vary on each server, if you want to become a cop, most of the time they want you white-listed. the server i play on the most: serverfilter: trinity join me.",3
"amazing! just wow, graphics are so good, its scary, (oh snap! granade!! wait, its just a game! :) ) i am a huge fan of bohemia interactive and codemasters, from operation flashpoint when i was 7 (dont tell anyne :p ) all the way to this beta game, and for this price ( which is steep, but you will never ever run out of missions to create. want to kill a government leader? get a mod of that guy and do it! , and the ai are tough to kill, but if you catch them by suprise they are alot easier to destroy, and no spamming units in warfare will help, its all about strategy, and with the new uavs and ugvs , im suprised the millitary doesnt use it to train their teams, ( would be crazy to even think about that, but we have alot to learn from games... to sum this up in two words? buy it!!!!",1
"love the game, it is a great experience and i like to rekt redwingz everyday on arma 3.",9
"you need to buy an extra 3 cpus and an extra 80 gbs of ram to run this game at low settings 30 fps",1
"i think this game is great buy it omg im crying to my mom because she slaps the  out of me please help she wanted me to review this game help",1
"ive pondered the question many times what is arma? it is an military simulator but it isent? the conlusion ive come to is its minecraft for grown ups you can do anything as long as you have the skills and imagnation that the game requires and yes sometimes since its an upen world game it can get a bit willy wonka here and there but thats with every upen world game",10
"this game is very fun, but battle eye is a pain. they globally banned me for my cd key being stolen and my account was used for hacking. they told me it was my own fault for get my account hacked and my cd stolen. battle eye is a horrible company and i have no idea why any one uses their serves. if i was you i wouldnt get the game because you will probably get banned in the next week and waste $60. this game is not worth your time or your money.",1
"love it or hate it, but you wont be on the fence about it. i love it and if i had time it would swallow my life whole. (un?)fortunately theres another (none) game out there that can do the same; rocksmith 2014 and i cant put that one down either so at tqeh moment rs2014 is winning out, but i have no doubt i will return to arma 3 and loose a whole other chunk of my life!!!",1
"such a great military simulator you cant turn your head around in a car to look around where are you supposed to go... a z-category shooter but you still have to use controls like if it would be starcraft. i dont play an fps to use my whole keyboard to issue broken commands. dont buy this game. for a strategy game theres only horribly-done strategy elements, and for an fps theres horribly done fps elements in it. for squads and commanders, buy battlefield or any other non-garbage tactical shooter, this game is just bad.",1
"arma 3 is the latest game made by bohemia interactive. it is absolutly beautifull when on high graphics. lots of possibilties for modding, *cough* arma-holic *cough*. a new mod has surfaced called arma 3 takistan life. its the arma 2 taki life mod ported but it feels better. arma 3 altis life is very good. many servers and lots of fun to be had. as you can see from my hours on this account alone arma 3 is a very enjoyable game. its also a very very good combat simulator. king of the hill is one of the most enjoyable. the new karts dlc is very fun to play with friends and the zeus dlc is brilliant. great for multiplayer missions. get this game 9.5/10. 0.5 - waiting for my battleships ! bohemia. :)",5
"a good game with a big community adding so much more to this game. 8/8",5
"fun game, has a different feel to arma 2. just make sure you have a graphics card that will run it well.",1
"this game is hard. you jump out of a building-splat-dead. you are walking aroung- bang-dead. you are in a tank-mine explodes-dead. however,once you learn all of the tricks(about 75 hours for me) it starts to get really rewarding. this game is very immersive from the fact that you can shoot enemies from over 2 klicks, you can fly helicopters, fixed wing, and drones. you can drive tons of vehicles, or you can just walk around as a rifleman. use the mission editor to create a mission to your liking, download mods to (nearly) perfect your game. a.i. is kinda glitchy, some textures arent perfect but overall, fantastic game. seriously, one of my friends needs to buy this so we can play together.",3
"while we were chatting it up around the fire cooking some poor  who ran into a group of people he wished he wouldnt have, our buddy in the background died in a massive explosion while refueling his chopper, just another day in epoch.",7
"best shoote...er simulater ive ever had the pleasure to play. cod is for toddlers, bf is for kids. if youre a real man, or trying to emulate one; buy this game.",2
"awesome game want it so bad i think if you press ctrl and v or something you knocked them out can can steal thier money",1
"im glad i could play arma 3 for free on this last weekend, thus preventing me from buying it, ever. every game should give buyers this option, to try before buying. while arma 3 may be a good game, im sure now that its not for me. i have been playing bf for a long time, even bf4 now, and i think bf spoiled me. i really tried enjoying arma 3, but i couldnt. in my humble opinion: bad graphics, bad optimization, bad performance, bad gameplay, bad controls, bad hud, bad voip, bad campaign and bad multiplayer. ive spent nearly one hour on multiplayer driving a truck around the map, trying to figure what to do, how to get a weapon and where were my team mates. before that i tried campaign, with no satisfaction either. its is an expensive game. im really glad i didnt bought it.",1
"a3 is gorgeous. bohemia really did a good job with this game. for now i play the epoch mod & anticipate all future updates to both the mod & the game itself. would like to see more dlc.",4
"having followed this franchise since its original appearance as operation flashpoint back in the late 90s it struck me as game to follow, and for good reason. it wasnt a game about running in guns blazing (although youre welcome to give that a go), it was a simulation of what war is like, where one minute you could be running through a field with your squad to hold the town and then the next you get clipped by a bullet from got knows where because you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. if you want a game that is a corridor shooter, with arcade reflexes and regenerating health, then this isnt the game for you. if you like a challenge, like realism and immersion then deffinately give this a go. on another plus side, the devs are always updating this franchise with patches and has one of the best modding communities out there. if the devs havet done it yet, then the modding community more than likely has.",1
"pros: it is a game, it does things, good things, things blow up. not all games can do that cons: when ever i play zeus riod is in control, he is german, this is not a problem, only a fact, he is though an utter  when he lightning strikes my face just beucase the only weapon i use is a missle launcher, i mean this is a realism game, that means it is realistic. and there for if someone hides in a feild i will not see them, so i just blow up the ing field........ say that it is a realism, and in real life how the  can you call down magical lightning strikes...... ing german people and there magic powers......",6
"my game wont install its really annoying can anybody help?",1
"best game ive probably ever played? i would really reconmend this game if you got a mate its brillant, its great crack, lots of laughs not buggy and fun to play even if your serious about it",6
"great game fun playing with friends and just having fun",3
"highly recommended for serious tactics-gamers. lightyears away from more or less arcade-games like battlefield 3, cod etc. even as an alpha-release its already a great game with really benchmarking features in tactics, gameplay and suspense. as the subtitle says: this is war - or at least something very similar.",1
"arma 3 had a horrible release, it took about a year just to make it somewhat decent, still not a great game. arma 2 is still far better in my opinion.",1
"the most unrealisitic realistic simulation game ever.",2
"11/10 realistic, immersive, amazing. desync and randomly exploding vehicles are still an issue though. overall fantastic work by bi!",5
"yes i would recommend i watch videos of arma 3 and there cool",1
"playing wasteland is the way to go! love the mechanics of this game.",1
"i really enjoy this game, its mods and glitches add a whole lot to this game. i personally enjoy arma 3 life the best because of the roleplay and occasional police chases.",2
"this is an awesome game!! really realistic. so far everything that i could want in a shooter and more.",5
"hello arma i will just go streight on and say its a good game worth evry penny of the money they ask for .",1
"a really fun game that is a great improvement compared to arma 2 when it comes to combat and animations as well as the variety of gamemodes. however, the game is a little unfinished or requires a little more refurbishment when it comes to general points such as audio and factions (combat audio such as firefight sounds including distancing of gunshot sounds is disapointing). however, overall, the game is a deffinate must buy and some improvements can be made with few simple mods easy to download.",7
"if you like realistic war games, this has to be yours!!",1
"this is by far the most dumbest and worst game ive ever played, the misions are ing horrible, nothing happens in 30 mins and then only 3 guys pop up and then nothing happens for another 30 mins. if you are ready to start hating yourself then buy this game and regret it forever. its was a mistake buying this",1
"maybe someone can help me. ive been running arma for a few months and after about a month of playing my computer atomatically shuts the program down kicking me from the game completely. then it will let me back on the game for about 10 mins and do the same damn thing. why is this happening plz someone tell me whats going on.",1
"first arma game ive owned along with great frist impressions.",1
"well am an arma 2 veteran i was skeptical on getting the 3rd game of the series and man am i sad to say this game is a blow to the series while there are many new things that do look and feel rather amazing most of the content was cut out by the devs due to unknown reasons,lack of weapons,vehicles,maps and general content makes the game feel rushed and unfinished. i have been there since alpha and yet not much honestly has changed i think the creators let this game slip with intention since little information is given about new content from the community managers and devs themselfs making this just another generic ocd/add combat shooter. it may best to say wait 5 years until most of the content will be added by the fanbase and community modders . . .",2
"id rather eat someones ashes then play this game. ive spent $60 on papper once and thatwas more enjoyable then this ing piece of . this makes call of duty look fun.  this piece of  game.",1
"i played during a free weekend on steam. things i liked: realistic gunplay and movement. graphics look pretty good. online multiplayer in modes such as wasteland are very fun. basically dayz w/o zombies (although there is a mod like dayz for arma 3). what i did not like: while the game played smoothly for single player the multiplayer played not nearly as well. i would get around 15 fps even though i am above the minimum requirements. this may be able to be resolved with more tweaking or patches in the future. i have found a set of servers that seem to run pretty good however so i usually stick to those. from the time i spent with it during the free weekend (10 hours) i was convinced to buy it for the 50% off price of $30.",1
"great funny but you need a good computer to run this i get 60+ fps in any gamemode.",6
"call me stupid, close minded, or awful at this game. i read the reviews, plenty of people said you either love it or hate it. welp. i tried joining 3 or 4 games. it was buggy as all get out. i clipped through random crap, there was no meaningful tutorial, the controls were confusing, and the maps seemed huge once i managed to join. i had no idea what i was doing, most of the guides were either in cyrillic or were mentioning some game mode, nothing outlining the basics. im not usually one to say something is overcomplex and walk away, but  this game is hard to enjoy. ill take another crack at it im sure, because i did just sink $40 in to this that i can never have back, but id advise others to avoid purchasing, even if you arent a filthy casual like myself. because damn. this game is stupidly obtuse.",1
"have you ever wanted a game that makes you feel like youre a badass army dude? if so, dont buy this game! no, instead this game has an even better experience. it requires skill and teamwork in order to win. the map is huge too. not only that but the modding capability is very expanded. overall i would easily play this game instead of call of duty or battlefield any day of the week.",1
"3 hours and i already want a divorce and quiet place to play...forever...",1
"only played about an hour so far however, i have enjoyed that small time very much! way more realistic than arma ii, which i enjoyed as well. attachments, costume customization, ragdoll, graphics, swimming, extra animations and improved sniping adds for a great game... well done although, i cannot rate this yet. if youre looking for a war simulator, this is for you. the graphical optimisation still makes me want to vomit and i have not currently found the character customizer yet. snipe on!",2
"there is nowhere to start with this game. i started a editor level and flew around the cities. i nerdgasmd when i saw the water in this game. bohemia have done a beautiful job designing and making this game. my computer isnt the best one to play it on though - but i still managed to fit in a worthy amount of the campaign and multiplayer options. the maps in arma 3, ( atlis and stratis) are very large and have been completely mastered. from guns to drones, i adore this game. thank you for bringing us a masterpeice, bohemia.",1
"this game is really fun, i enjoy playing online alot",8
"really great game! much realistic, very deaths. but seriously! this game is the most realistic fps! it only takes a few shot to die. you definitely are not arnold schwarzneger (terminator), sylvester (rambo) or daniel craig (james bond). it has very hard singleplayer missions. maybe its because i usually act like terminator and try to run in everyones face with my assault rifle... dunno.. feels realistic.",1
"if your looking for a very demanding military shooter experience this is it. great campain so far and the modding comunity is adding fantastic things to the game.",9
"pros: better graphics better controls better sound cons: same laggy multiplayer as arma 2 same terrible interaction system still using outdated arma 2 mod tools (all mods are just ports) most vehicles and weapons are the same between factions, just different textures still uses 2004 netcode its trying to be more casual as of right now, i do not feel as if this game is worth the $60, it still plays like its in alpha. unless they release proper mod tools, i would not buy until it drops atleast 50% in price.",3
"i swam for 30 minutes and the black man ran over by boat.",1
"alpha version of the military simulater arma iii. worth you time, if you enjoy tactical immersion!",1
"unfinished piece of . not a game but bugged platform for users to make their own games.  in all aspects but unique hardcore gameplay.",3
"love the game!. havent had as much fun playing a game as i have this one in a long time. the multiplayer mod servers are where you will have the most fun at!.",1
"if you like your military sims this has to be the daddy! also add mods to your game and obtain even more playability. one game i will recommend to anyone.",2
"for me is this the most realistic game ever! campain is less boring than in flashpoint and previous arma series. for me is main editor. you can create what you want. you can make funny scenes etc. this game is really originally and one of few games what are good for buy. authors are looking after this game -> thats next reason. this is not wasted many !",1
"this game is not in the least bit enjoyable. graphics are really good, but everything from sound to gameplay is straightout of 1995. its buggy, half of the features dont work correctly, and the community is absent. on a saturday afternoon there are maybe 2 full servers at best. i think this stems from terribly boring gameplay, you dont see another player for hours and the community is no help whatsoever. all they say is herp derp go play call of duty if you want something enjoyable to play save your money.",1
"a really good game!a lot of mods to play with.but it has some bugs.",2
"broken and they are making dlcs instead of fixing the game.",1
"do you like wandering around in the middle of no where for 2hrs just to get killed one min into combat? do you love admin abuse? well boy do i have a game for you! its called arma 3 , if you like a whole lot of walking around and doing nothing , your gonna love this",1
"want a game you can play for years and have no limits to what can be done with this game? 275 hrs and counting and i still find new stuff to do all the time. only cons are as always with arma, optimization blows. but quite honestly, i probably wouldve paid $200 if thats what they charged, its that good.",3
"u can buy dayz u can buy payday 2 or u can buy something like that price or u can buy arma 3 and play wasteland with your friends or solo u can single u can play dayz mod or if u want to real life go play it arma 3 has it too nah im interesting with something else if u are saying arma 3ll have it mode buy it mate...",1
"best game in the world armaa iii is one of the best games ive ever played in my life... cause its not just a war simulator... all the people would like this game cause : 1- if youre a kind of man who likes rpg games then you can just go and play arma iii altis life or the life mod... 2-if youre a kind of man who likes survival games then you can just install epoch or breaking bad mod and enjoy it 3-if you like pvp games you can just play arma iii wasteland or king of the hill or coop mod... so as you can see arma iii is just full of different mods and stuff... but people dont have same feelings...i like this game i my self but a guy with different feelings and needs would not . so youre the guy who chooses what to play i hope this review be helpful... and sorry for bad english :)",1
"its a great game, i mostly like the rpg mods but thats just me, what do you think?",1
"amazingly fun, amazingly hard. this is for real, folks. forget about running and gunning. forget about killing soldiers who see you first. youre dead. annoying? yes. but so much fun, still! i love the feel to the game. the graphics are amazing, and its incredibly immersive. especially coupled with a good head tracking system like the trackir!",1
"very fun game, requires some skill but also a great amount of strategy. lots of fun to play with realism communities as well",2
"needed to get to a battle. player flys squad out to a strategic overwatch position. pilot doesnt know how to land. flips helicopter and plows us into the ground. ok respawn. still need to get to battle. different player flys squad to a strategic overwatch position. pilot also doesnt know how to land. barrel rolls into a treeline. weve been playing for 45 minutes. 10/10 no but seriously, amazingly deep military sandbox.",1
"better than cod. may strain your computer, your memory (realizm demands many keyboard shortcuts), and your eyesight (is that a rock or is that a sniper trying to line up a shot at my head?). longer multiplayer matches than battlefield (lets retake the entire island with our 30 man team against an actual army). fantastic steam workshop content in the form of car races, single- and multi-player campaigns, and shooting ranges. 9/10.",1
"best game ever. you can play wasteland or battle royal. if you prefer more relaxing gameplay then try altis life role play.",4
"good games also if still in alpha with a big potential to became one of the best ever",1
"fantastic sim/game. learning curve is fairly small and incredably rewarding! if you like action games, blowing sh!t up, team work, driving, flying and diving! then this is probably the best game out there!",1
"if you like tactical military simulation genre, buy this, try to explore arma world like altis life, wasteland, and many more cant stop play without it 11/10",6
"this game is great it offers a wide variety of things to play and to whether your thing is role play or killing people just because u can. id recommend this game to nearly everyone who like fast pace shooter or zombie survival.",3
"this game is worth way more than $60. when i buy a game i think that every dollar should act as an hour of fun, i have over 150 hours on this game and i do not plan to stop playing anytime soon. the free roam is better then anyother game i have played/watched. you can be anything... a plain rifleman, you can be a sniper, a diver, you can wear a ghillie suit and have silenced weapons, a drone operator, a tank operator, a platoon commander/squad leader, and so much more. there are also great community game modes such as: bennys warfare, king of hill, and so much more. this game will fit any kind of playstyle you have. the realism is truly amazing, the only bad thing: you need a good graphics card to truly experience the beauty of arma 3.",6
"terrible optimization, controls, plot and animations. most of servers have white list so they will kick out as you join them. when you find a good server all you play is a walking simulator and not a war game. i am not a call of duty or battlefield fan but i think they are good games if you compare them to this. also, people pretend this war game is realistic. no, its not. the only realistic thing is the boredom",1
"this game is totally not recommended. i have a superpowerful pc 2x geforce 980 gtx and got only 30f/s or less. the problem is that the game uses only a small amount of your hardware. i think it only uses 30 percent of the full power of your pc. no one can play this game on max settings even with the highest end hardware.",1
"children play call of duty boys play battlefield men play arma",2
"remarkably well put together as bohemia games go! i only noticed two serious game play  ups: the ai twice ( in my entire 40 hour playthrough) decided to just sit in a house and play dominos rather than follow me into battle. beautiful game, the sound and your vulnerability makes every firefight an intense one, and close quarters stuff is just amazing. the thrill of getting the drop on the enemy ai ( which is a tough son of a  at the best of times) is great.",1
"one of the best sim game i have ever played. can be slow at times but once you get in the action it feels great",2
"buy this awesome simulator, and it doesnt need high powered computer for graphs!",1
"i would not say this game is worth buying at full price, but i can tell you that its really fun nonetheless. there are a lot of bugs and it feels more like a retextured and updated arma 2 but there are plenty of fun scenarios and multiplayer is very good. the game requires a really beefy computer to not run on  graphics so if you have a crappy computer and you dont want to see  graphics, then dont get this game. however, if youre up for an intense milsim, then get this game. rate: 8/10",1
"i love this game, but i have a screenshaking problem that has persisted over many updates. ive posted in the troubleshooting forum to no avail, and ive looked it up online and tried dozens of troubleshooting processes. nothing has worked. i payed full price for a game i cant play, kinda sucks. r9 280x 6gb, amd fx6300, 8gb ram.",1
"great game few minor glitches but overall singleplayer and multiplayer are fantastic",1
"this is not a game, this is a simulation if anything. admittedly its not really war, and its not a good representation of the horrors of conflict, but its significantly better than call of dutys over romanticized grade 6 representation. as for worth, this is not a game you can really quantify. unlike many games where the campaign length or the multiplayer dictate its quality, this is much more than a game. if you played and liked arma 1, or 2, buy 3. and if youre thinking about buying arma 3, do it. the endless modibility, the mission creation and steam workshop, and the rich community are what make the arma series a true beauty. not to mention the multiplayer and campaign are kick .",5
"best like real gameplay! when you hear bullets pass over---- puts you in a place where you never think you be in.",10
"this game is worth buying just for battle royale alone. the controls are a little awkward, but with a bit of rebinding, youll be just fine.",2
"soo realistic that i cant tell the difference with real life and the game.",1
"if theres any game i like, its arma 3 with its amazing gamplays. arma 3s singleplayer is fun, but i think multiplayer is the best",2
"so, this is my review on arma 3, now if your looking for a game with a weak canpaign involving real military tactics but slow gameplay, this is what you get, but, this game is all about the multiplayer and the mods, the mods are out of this world, the only real gamemode i play is battle royal, you bassically get chucked out of a heli onto an island you then have to find a a gun and other things to keep yourself alive, danger every where, random carpet bombings, carepackages, and the other playes, it is a free for all, theres only one surviver, the game does not end till there is only one person alive. overall this game is one of my all time favourite games and i 100% recommened picking this up specially as its on sale, 9/10.",2
"graphics, gameplay, and multiplayer. this game has many things that make it awesome! 10/10",5
"the gameplay is very enjoyable and the engine provides accurate simulation. it is heavily let down by the lack of optimisation and ai performance. while the desync issues have mostly been ironed out the complete lack of performance on even the highest performing pcs sees this game well under even 30fps. but i still reccomend it if you can push through the negatives.",7
"outstanding game, many many hours of fun! the large support of built-in mods, and friends make this game a serious winner. intel fans will love this game, amd processor fans.... not so much. personal experience is that my i7 2600k had a good 30% increase in frames compared to my fx-8350, same graphics cards and memory amount + memory speed.",1
"take a few friends and play wasteland mode if you want awesomeness !",1
"i love this game.i remember watching gameplay of the alpha version and when arma was released i bought it even though my pos laptop wouldnt run it.i played and averaged out about 11 fps on minimum settings,but even though it sit in my library i have grown more facial hair so its a plus:)since then i bought a better pc and so its playable now",6
"alright is this a good game or not.well if you ask me its kind of hard the controls are wierd (exept walking shhoting and spriting) and they are hard to remeber.but this game offers alot and by alot i really mean alot.good looking graphix and textures intense heartbeating combat looting military wastelands mode custom mods that i dont know how to install windows 8 skin :(.co-op and campaing are pretty good but i wish some of my other friends would ow this game but it costs a lot and its no worth of that amount of money like 25,50 euros are good price in my opinion but then it offers alot of game modes.i think this is a good game,but you should just buy it from a tf2 outpost dealer.but i got this cheaper caus of the alpha release. but overall 4/5",1
"well at the moment i think this game is not for action game players or absolute novices. it is game about walking long distances (as you cant run as you always are tired and out of breath) just to shoot few bullets and get killed. as a military game i believe it is best what you can get - forget that stuff like call of duty or battlefield. personally - this game is not for me and every moment i get pissed off a lot in it. recommend only for someone who is looking for very serious ang high quality games.",1
"fantastic improvement on arma 2. while it is a military sim, and im still not 100% how to play the proper game modes, theres plenty for the adverage fps player to make the most of. gun game and battle royale to name a few,",1
"been a battlefield fan for a while then i came upon arma 2 which blew me away and since then have followed to arma 3 and it just keeps getting better and better. maps are big and a big varity of vechicles just need a good eye and switched on and you do fine.",1
"as an arma veteran, i personally recommend this game to anyone who likes the arma series.",3
"poor singleplayer, excellent and huge ( i mean really, really huge) multiplayer.",1
"good game suggest playing wasteland and altis life",2
"i love this game more than selena gomez. (thats a lot) :)",2
"arma 2 - failed college and became obese. arma 3 - failed my life.",1
"very fun i have had it for like 4 months and i never played it but once i did i was hooked",1
"hey gamers! if you want a buggy game that feels like an alpha test for the low low price of $60 then this is the game for you! multiplayer? you will lag out and be randomly kicked to add a certain degree of excitement! hey! i finally got a bunch of weapons so i hope the game crashes and kicks me off! that could be you! here at bohemia interactive we couldnt care less about your gaming experience! we already have your money!! so hurry up and give us your hard earned cash and you can jump right in the fight, then get randomly disconnected and overwhelmed with bugs! go on! you know you want to!",3
"the closest thing to being in a real war, except you can fight this one sitting on a comfy chair eating hamburgers. realistically modelled grass gets in your way when you lie down, which i never really thought about until playing this game. 5 stars!",3
"arma 3 is a great tactical shooter. im going through cons first and then pros. cons -sometimes joining servers might be laggy -if you dont have a good pc you wont be able to run this game -single player isnt the best thing in this game pros +great multiplayer +good graphics +many weapons and vehicles +really good tactical shooter 8/10 when playing alone. 9/10 with friends",1
"free for a weekend played it for 24 hours, great game",5
"oh god yes <3 this game needs more units tho... but it keeps getting better and better so dont worry :p",1
"awesome game! very fun and well thought out. the big arsenal of mods makes it endlessly more fun to play! 10/10 would play again.",6
"a game in which almost always when you die it is the games fault. broken  piece of  in which you have to scroll through menus to do  which is very convenient when in the middle of a firefight, almost revolutionary id say. a simulator where the cars explode(!) when you crash it into anything. this is a game made by devs who have never played any modern games and take all their inspiration from their own past games and the only one that they made that was considered modern was the original operation flashpoint back in 1998 or something. all their games past that have imitated that game and arma 3 design is still based on that game (read: doesnt work very well anymore, or never really did) if it still isnt very obvious this is a rage post. ive played the game for over 100 hours for some reason and i continue to play it but im still convinced that 10 hours in bohemias office and i could fix the design of this game.",2
"logged on. got kidnapped. had my kidneys stolen. fell off a building and died...10/10 would buy again!",1
"so much fun playing the game along with friends. the single player has alot of fun working with players to take down your enemy.",3
"if you see me playing this, im probably having the time of my life, so dont bug me.",3
"one of the best simulation games ive ever played! :d",1
"amazing depth and attention to detail. highly recommend trying (but really giving it a chance) altis life... really submersive gameplay with almost a realitime interactive storyline to it.. train to become a police officer or a medic, or become a rebel and perform raids and attacks on towns. only issue i have with arma 3 is when i alt+tab and then go back into to the game my player loses the ability to jog, only walking or sprinting...",6
"if you get bored of all those cod/bf clones out there, try something new and more real. in arma 3 one bullet can be your end, at full health. how it should be. it has far better emersion than any cod, bf or cs game ever had.",2
"looking pretty amazing; absolutely can not wait for the final product. this game is going to be intense.",10
", you pay $60.00 for a game only for it to be 40% off, 3 days later!!",1
"while the ai can be a flaw, there are mods that fix that, and i greatly enjoy this game overall, its one of the best games ive ever played. 15/10 :3",1
"a very fun modern war game! i also really like the mods for the gam.",1
"would suck  for this game, 10/10, (but seriously, someone gimme game plz im in severe arma withdraw.)",1
"this game is very broken, and the controls are horrible. just like arma 2. therefore, its amazing",1
"decided out of the blue to finally buy... did not regret, only a few hours on a multiplayer koth and i enjoyed myself. great game like arma2 and oa was plus more features, cant wait to see dayz mod here. furthermore im running on a laptop, preformed well enough",4
"i won a firefight in the middle of the night chilling out in limeri bay and it lasted 3 hours 10/10",2
"i love playing on epoch and altis life but i wish it was optimized.",1
"amazing. so much to do. so much content. whoever likes sim-style games/the arma series. this is (after some patching and content adding by the devs ;) ) definitely a must have! edit: too bad they add all these (expansive) addons, but now after the game and campaigns are finished its for me like an amazing sandbox/sim/fps game, that only the kerbal space program can reach in terms of replayability. very well done bohemia.",1
"this game is nothing but amazing.... i dont have a bad word to say about this game... this game is even better when being used to play dayz.... a must have for any arma fan",2
"this is a must buy if you like shooters and strategy games.",1
"best military game out there without a doubt. with the active community youll pretty much never be out of things to do. the only drawback is the low cpu and gpu utilization which kills fps especially online.",1
"its a very good game to play with your friends but if you want to play something like rping then try altis thats something that is fun to do. plus you can be a cop, medic or a civilian!",2
"this (like all the other arma games) is a great game. there is just so much to do with the workshop that i would never get bored. multiplayer is also fun. single player : i dont really play single player in arma games mainly because the ai, but it is great. mutliplayer : multiplayer is awesome! you can play actual gamemodes like invade & annex, wasteland, or domination. then you can play the rp gamemodes like altis life or takistan life. i give this game a 8/10 could be optimized better.",1
"outstanding tactical game if you want realism, multiple play styles and endless customisation!!!! a must have to learn to play!",7
"found a chance to try rp. bought a car and equipment before a crew bumped to my car. they stole my equipments and my clothes also my car. ive said them i need to find my kid. they said we will help. they took me a place where they stole your kidney. they stole my kidney and literally gave it to my hand. then they took it back and put a bullet in my head. 10/10 would take my kidney on my hand again.",1
"best game ever shoot many enemy wow. get apc sshoot many raket for enemy i like 5/5 only noobs and  dont recommind this game #yolo #sweg",2
"arma 3: arma the almighty miletary sim, which may catch your eye with the immersive feel and the futuristic feel which i will get to later. i feel that this is a good arma but not on the same par as arma 2 which can i tell you can be either a bag of piss or alot of fun to play with bugs and  ai to some of the most action packed immersive combat you will experience to date. arma 3 delivers what it sets out to do an invasion of a made up map and you need to help secure it (sorry if you would class that as a spoiler). there are few if any bugs and beautifull graphics great multiplayer improvement from arma 2 but as a fan of the series i am a bit dissapointed in bohemia with their choice of a futeristic feel which i dont personally like compared to modern combat. if you are a laid back gamer you will still enjoy this title due to the community, multiplayer, beauty, editor. the editor is my favourite part of the game as it lets you be creative and put what you would want in a campaign mission into your own. overall i would reccomend this game but if you are looking for an army sim go for arma 2 by far.",1
"if you like super realistic, first person shooters, this is the game for you!",1
"best combat simulator of all types to this day with a varied selection of add-ons via the steam workshop",3
"excellent stuff (if you like this sort of thing, i certainly do). there are so many missions on the steam workshop that gives this an incredible amount of content to play.",5
"this is very amazing game! , you guys should buy it !!!",4
"to have fun in this game you must work with your teammates. communication makes this game fun (or funny, youll meet great guys on this game). going somewhere alone if the most boring expierence youll have. get to that city with all your teammates and find a town to take over, plan your assault then execute. you might be able to get some good mods on this game too (battle royale, breaking point) that will only expand your game expierence. when you first start off your frames will be absolute crap, google stuff to find fixes, you just have to change some stuff in your game files. stick to certain servers too. they may be the only ones with good frames/those cool guys you were playing with earlier. all in all you gotta trust my review because i only write long reviews for games im passionate about. single player: creates that epic feel that multiplayer has, with a story. 8/10, a little clunky multi-player: epic stuff. great community. you can let that tactical guy out of you that says tango or hostile instead of enemy. 10/10 mod support, in-depth video settings. overall: 9/10 game. does not deserve to sit in your library and rot.",2
"this game was amazing! after only 5 hours of playing during the free weekend, i must admit it was hard to say goodbye!",1
"if you like buggy  that doesnt work, this is the game for you. thank you bohemia, for another glorious crapfest.",1
"this game is great, however you should get it with friends or join a clan right away.",9
"fun and realistic combat simulator. strong lurning curve but when you start to learn it, you can have alot of fun. i strongly recommend to people who like realistic games.",1
"coming from a very extensive flight sim background, i generally expect too much from games these days. having the whole planet at your fingertips flying from city to city, country to country... high fidelity aircraft systems correctly simulated.. it sure sets a high bar! but arma 3 leaves no part of me unsatisfied, the immersion factor is brilliant and playing with the right people very professional! i definitely recommend!",2
"brilliant game if your in the market for mil-sim where you arnt a bullet eating machine like in cod. easy to learn the basics but a very steep learning curve to master. a brilliant mission editor gives this game endless replyability. (better with friends)",1
"if you like milsim games then this is the game for you.",4
"one of the most realistic games ever. gr8 b8 m8 no h8 8/8",1
"hard in when you start playing but get more fun while you play, this game is the best 10.5/10 and if you have epoch message me",1
"love this game could play for the rest of forever just need to make the dlc free and add in new gun skins aswell as new air/land/sea vehicles. other than this its a beautifull game.",9
"arma 3 is a fun game to play with friends if you dont have anyone to play with its not gunna be that fun but its a great game but only one thing i dont get why did they have to make the controlles so weird i mean why but besides that its a great game",1
"great game without mods. even better with mods! my favorite mods are tfar and acre!",10
"seemed pretty fun, but i think it would be much better if it was actually optimised and able to get more than 25 frames. its way to arcadey, and took arma 2s barebone flight mechanics and somehow made it worse. barely anyone online (probably playing their $30 mod) too. playing this game makes me want to be a ing terrorist, so i could do the world a favor and kill the team at bi who made this. 9.999999999/10 its alright",1
"i love this be nice it was free for one time and i can keep it i really like it so cool so fun to play u guy rock :3",3
"very laggy, and soooo much swearing. (i have a gaming pc)",1
"arma 3 is suddenly marked as a complete game, and they come out with a big dlc a week later? better idea, how about you suck my  bohemia?",1
"this game is one of the most, if not the most realistic shooter game i have played. the multiplayer is a definate must especially if you can find a semi serious server where people work together to complete objectives. all in all this game is very enjoyable and the community is great!",1
"easily the best, most polished installment of bis arma series. ive been playing bi games since 2001s operation: flashpoint. its amazing to see how the same engine (real virtuality) has evolved over the years, errrr decades actually, wow its been a while - now i feel old. so, in summary, arma 3 is a complex and realistic simulator that allows players to realize the rapidly impending date of their last breath, to know that every second that ticks by their billions of cells die just a little bit more, their neurons demyelinating, and their arteries incrementally hardening. its a firm unyielding grip that death has upon us, he authoritatively clutches the keys to the universe in one bony claw and simultaneously our hearts and souls in the cold phalanges of the other. thank you arma 3 for revealing the terrifying reality of my mortal existence. in death we are infinitely alone, no one to hear our trembling wimpers as we rock back and forth in the dark corner of an unending void of pure, sterile, black nothingness that warps us further into catatonia. score: 10/10",4
"great looking game altho it has probably the worst control setup of shooter i have played. after 30 minutes of trying to figure out how to walk and turn trying different key configurations i gave up.",1
"although many fans of the arma series have been critical of certain aspects of this game(such as the choice to make it based in the future) i would still highly recommend this game to any fan of fps, rpg, or strategy game types. the base game is basically fps, but the modding community has expanded its basic description to meet other gamers needs(including my own). this game has a strong/loyal fan base, and has for years. if you dont try this game at some point you honestly havent lived!",9
"this game is epic battleground. worth to buy and play. so many different maps and mods.",3
"they need to work on there servers, hackers are taking over the servers and changing stuff, so they really need to work on that, other then that its my favorite game.",2
"wonderful game... the only problem for me is that my multiplayer will crash when trying to load it up.",1
"this is the most realistic war game in existence at the moment. do not buy this game if you enjoy call of duty or other similar shooting galleries. this game is hardcore with its precise controls, realistic damage model, and complicated battles. the singleplayer campaign is something to be marveled. it blends realistic war with an intriguing story. this game is for those who want more from the everyday shooter. you must be dedicated if you want to play this game. i will easily reccomend this game but only if you know what you are getting into.",1
"nothing can compare to the variety of gameplay arma iii has to offer.",10
"this game is great. i would suggest playing the gamemode called altis life in multiplayer. find the right server and have fun! you choose your lifestyle on the giant playground altis has to offer. with friends, or not, its one of those things that work either way.",4
"excellent sandbox simulation, but unlike others i will not say it is a total military simulation. vehicles and aircraft and their controls, pathfinding, etc. need vast improvement for this to even be considered a survey sim. however, arma 3 is an excellent infantry simulator and the vehicles and aircraft used as a supporting cast are sufficient. thrown in the community mods, game modes, and missions and nothing can beat arma 3. i just wish the grass was not so cheesy looking when you crawl though it, and the graphics were a bit more cinematic. i guess one cannot have everything.",2
"i got shot, dragged into a garage, was told i was now a sex slave, and t-bagged until my inevitable death. i then went back and thanked the people for that experience, and they shot me again.",1
"will not update it goes to 100 then update pasued then ill play it and makes me redo the update then over and over again someone help plz",4
"10/10 best military simulator i have tried and although it takes some getting used to its worth the money 100%",7
"arma 3 is turning out to be a great game, with problems at the start which knocked my confidence it has now bounced back and is shining",6
"a very very good dude shooter with things that only can happen in arma. 11/10 its kind of the bomb.",6
"new mechanics, less gear. thats all i can say. i miss the mass of equipment in arma 2, now a days you can buy some more  purely for vanilla mp servers. so yeah, equipment is in lower quantity with a bit better quality. the downside is the s want you to pay 66 bucks still, i payed around 30 or so when it first came out. so, i recommend this game, lots of cool , but on the other hand ill point out the lack of crap in comparison to arma 3, also vanilla maps suck. modding it is a helpful option to deal with the lack of vanilla .",4
"an excellent soldier sim, made for the grown ups, no cod kiddies here! the game is massive, the multiplayer is extremely good, has a great mod community thanks to the stellar steam workshop and the visuals are fantastic! definately worth a buy!!",1
"right ... this is one of the best/worse games ever and i say that because the gameplay experience is awesome, like no other, but all the glitches and crashes of the game just put you off playing it. i every morning try and play it and it crashes on me more than 10 times, now tell me who will have the nerve to keep on trying and trying and trying to get in and play. most of the people wouldnt even bother. i would understand the situation if my pc was crap and for that to be the reason for the game to crash, but i have a dell 8700 xps (specs under) and it still crashes on me like its nothing. 35 pounds for a broken vanilla game ... man thats outrageous ... proper daylight robbery is what it is. really pissed off ... this game could ruin your whole day, but if ... only if the game starts and you get into a server ... im telling you youd have the best 3rd person/1st person shooter/military simulator gameplay experience ever ! ... it is totally up to you if you want to got through all the bs for this game .... processor 4th generation intel core i7-4770 cpu @ 3.40ghz operating system windows 7 memory1 16gb dual channel ddr3 1600mhz - 4 dimms hard drive 2tb 7200 rpm sata hard drive",4
"great game with great potentional with the modding community. arma 3 engine in itself is an amazing engine with plenty of scripting opportunities for new developers and experienced ones. without the modding community i dont think this game would be as popular as it is, but with the modding community its amazing what they bring to the table in this open world military simulator. between altis life (best described as grand theft auto where humans play every role), to wasteland, and even ahoyworlds co-op capture gameplay, this game has definitive replayability. i really love the dayz epoch mod, and breaking point mod as they both bring their own taste of the post-apocalyptic mayhem to the arma 3 community. now i cant wait for the helicopter dlc and the markman dlc coming soon. realism in flying helicopters and additional mid to long range weapons will just be icing on the cake for this series, and the cake isnt a lie with this one.",8
"what a dissapointment. massive step back from arma 2 and the campaign is made in the basic mission editor, i can make better missions myself. embarrasing.",1
"bohemia interactive outdid themselves with this game easily one of the best in the franchise to date. great modding community and forums.",5
"fantastic game, anyone with a brain can look at this and realize its a game to buy!",2
"arma 3 and the rest of the arma series is best enjoyed with either a good organized and not so serious group or friends. since this game lives by its user created content there is an editor included that lets you create you own missions. let those be small or large, easy or tough, you are the creator. not to forget the steadily growing amount of user created mods. this game is a simulator (sometimes for walking long distances), so do not expect any arcadey gameplay, you get shot, you may live and treat your wounds or you may die instantly. tactical thinking is the key here and running head on is mostly the wrong thing to do.",5
"i have been a fan of tactical shooters for as long as i can remember, my first one being the original rainbow six and all of its additions. hidden and dangerous, ghost recon, and the game that spawned this one operation flashpoint. as buggy and screwed up as that game was i was still able to eveintually play it. not the case with this game. there is no excuse for the graphical bugs and gameplay issues present in this game. there has been ample time for this game to be optimized and yet it is still a mess. i am able to play every graphic intensive game out there on my system yet this one is barely playable. it seems some people have been able to get it to work but no luck here. this is unfortunate as it looks like i would love this type of gameplay based on my history however looks like ill never find out since i cant even get it to run properly.",1
"amazing game!, has many things to do and have never been bored playing. full of cheap dlcs you can easly spend 50+ hours on this game, for what it costs its worth it!",6
"60 fps on singleplayer, 10 fps on multiplayer. 10/10 i ing love it",1
"not untill they get all of the bugs out, other than that its a great game!",5
"so much game for the money. its more than just another shooter game, there are loads of mods available which increase playability of this game hugely. from dayz style zombie survival mods to flappy birds style atv flying. race around altis in go-karts or try and complete the sky track in a 4x4. get serious with a sniper mission, or get scared on a horror map trying to find the mothman. have a second life, rob people, sell drugs and buy a house on altis life or survive and build your own base on overpoch. team up with friends and take over a village from terrorists or become superman and take on an army yourself. some of my favourite mods include overpoch, altis life, wasteland and battle royale. i highly recommend arma3. you all should get it! lots of hours worth of gaming here. entirely worth full price, even better value if you get it in a sale.",3
"the game where you can literally mod anything into it!",3
"so good i spent this time on making this part of a song made by epic rap battles of history mozart vs. skrillex :) was that a verse or did you just get the hiccups, im a protegie sonny & im about to smack a guy up, my music is 200 years old & its still excellent, in 2 more months away everyone will forget about you skrillex, i cant belive the way you dress when you dubstep out of the house, your like a emo steve argyle uhhh, reeka dead mouse, i am the worlds greatest composer, no one knows what you are, except a lonley little troll who knows how to press a space bar! - mozart",1
"its grown on me a little......*looks at hours played*",4
"brilliant game lovely guns but needs physics update for vehicles",2
"best milsim on steam, but needs a few mods to really shine",1
"better than arma 2. not so ing buggy. but still, a very nice game. i have 200 hours on this piece of . its very fun to slide on my  and shoot. i think call of duty advanced warfare should have the should  slide feature in it. overall i give this game 9.999999/10.5 .",4
"great military simulator. one of the best i have ever played. recommend it if you want to be challenged!",3
"1st game best grahpichs and features and mods and communicate",9
"great game. i use the editor for dayz cinematics. actually i dont really know how the game is. if i ever play it, i play altis life. but i know a  load about the editor. 9/10",1
"the best massively open world first and third person shooter i have every played. arma 3 makes call of duty advanced warfare and battle field 4 look likes child play. the amount of detail in all there helicopters, tanks, troop transports, characters, weapons, maps, lighting, effects, go-carts is overwhelming! sometimes when im flying over a city getting ready to para-drop into a hell fire of tanks and jets, i feel like im watching a hd action movie of the year! i dont what i love most about this game the most, might be laying in the grass on a hill a mile away from any conflict staring down my scope of my rifle calculating the wind and the bullet drop, then taking the shot. no game has every made me feel so rewarded when i complete a mission. amra 3 missions are not these 5 minute deathmatches there long fought out high action battles. also there map is so big its insane, and its not just one island, theres others that are insanely big, i cant even imagine how long it would take to go from one side of the main island to the other flying in a helicopter going over 200+ miles per hour. lastly very unique complex non-repetitive terrain. love it, care for it, buy it!",3
"pretty great game to be honost, but im gonna be real with you, this is not a game you play alone, at least have 1-3 friends you play with or else, itll be doll and boring. great realism, shaby graphics, good mechanics and a ok singleplayer.",1
"nothing beats popping a tire on a road sign and having to walk 10km to the nearest repair kit 10/10 i only really play this when i have a whole afternoon of nothing to do",4
"incredible game if ones rig can handle the beauty!",1
"great fps/simulator, not for cod style fans. -pros very immersive gfx with the mods/game types it always keeps the game fresh bullet physics are accurate excluding windage -cons sometimes (depending on the server/mod) you can have a very buggy gui overall this game is awesome if you like a more strategical fps (though it allows you to use 3rd person). due to the multitude of servers that run different game types you will find it hard to put this game down. if you like to rp then there is altis life which allows you to take up an persona and do task associated with a job that you choose. these types of servers are policed by a selected police force. if you are after some team work you can either choose a co-op mission which allows players to take on objectives enforced by a very intelligent ai. this being said there are servers that offer a pvp experience whether you want an objective base like king of the hill or deathmatch style. this game has what most gamers that enjoy fpss and even those who may not!",3
"a great military sim that keeps you engaged both in its story and its warfare. its a perfect slow and fast paced game and allows for multiple playable areas whether you are deploying and picking up troops, running a covert mission with your nightvision, traveling by sea to support ground troops, or fighting on the ground in armor such as tanks or battling on foot. it includes even more areas of battle such as close air support (cas) to diving underwater and traveling off shore to the area of opperation (ao). i highly recomend this game to anybody looking for a fun first or third person shooter that is very flexable with its battle.",9
"do not expect to find a completed military simulator upon downloading the game. do a little research, get the mods from the modding community, and then play. this game will not have many of the most requested features, its always been up to the fans to mod the game to perfection, dont expect that to change here. with the right mods, this game can take hours out of your life. without the mods, this game will fall short of your expectations. do not get this game if you dont like having your game modded. if the mods arent out there yet, give it some time. arma ii fans, welcome to the next installment, its about to get intense.",3
"a game in which almost always when you die it is the games fault. broken  piece of  in which you have to scroll through menus to do  which is very convenient when in the middle of a firefight, almost revolutionary id say. a simulator where the cars explode(!) when you crash it into anything. this is a game made by devs who have never played any modern games and take all their inspiration from their own past games and the only one that they made that was considered modern was the original operation flashpoint back in 1998 or something. all their games past that have imitated that game and arma 3 design is still based on that game (read: doesnt work very well anymore, or never really did) if it still isnt very obvious this is a rage post. ive played the game for over 100 hours for some reason and i continue to play it but im still convinced that 10 hours in bohemias office and i could fix the design of this game.",2
"the best available game for those who seek a reasonable combination of realism and gameplay balance in any first-person game!",4
"i love this game so much there is soo much to do on it with all the workshop and gamemodes there is a endless time i well play this game.",2
"dlc... so f***ing expensive mannn but gameplay witout dlc not so bad except bipod that cant f***ing use without markmans dlc wtf. pdf im suck at eng",1
"not much i can say one of the best games i have played",1
"best game in my mind. started playing arma 2 back when it came out and the amount of mods you can get for both is amazing but this game takes it a bit further. i can spend hours playing dress up and making meth in my underwear, nothing else compares. and if you want to play with milsim groups there are plenty out there. you can go diving with the female mod so you can have your babe with you, go sky diving then watch the sunset together. 11/10 will try to hit on that chick again.",8
"watched some streams and videos about altis life so even with the high price decided it looked fun. umm, yeah, the arma ui is all kinds of wonky. switched to single player campaign to learn it a bit better and it was pretty meh out the gate. lot of money for something that is everywhere for cheaper. probablly be alot more fun for me if i had a group or some like minded people to play with. /edit i still stand by the wonky controls but i have grown fond of some of the mods. king of the hill and some others are quite fun. i cant say i am that good at them but i have gotten better the more i play. for the money it still seems overpriced, but some good gameplay is to be had at times.",3
"i can wear a tron suit and drive around in a go-cart and blow up bases with an rpg, 10/10",5
"if your looking for a good military simulator, arma 3 is a game for you, there is a few bugs, but other than that, its provides a very good experience for casual and hardcore gamers, you should also check out arma 2, operation arrowhead and many more amazing games by bohemia interactive!",4
"playerunknowns battle royale - easily the best mod",1
"probably the best military sandbox game out there. quite a lot of bugs, might be unstable after updates, but the community is here, custom contents (mods) are a gamechanger. grab it, join a serious community, and enjoy the hell out of it.",7
"best army sim on the market. price may be a little big, but i dont regret it. 9 out of 10 highly recommend",1
"great game! but the problem is that it is too expensive. make it cost less and peoples will have more fun playing it with there friends, because right now arma 3 is forgotten cuz of day z. this game is without doubt the greatest war-sim ever, but yet it is way too expensive.",1
"this game is great. it has tons of different gamemodes to choose from. its a great realistic game with great graphics. (warning: need preety decent computer to run well) some of the best gamemodes include, altis life(stratis life, arma life) which is a role playing gamemode, where your goal is to make that moolah. whether it be selling apples or dealing drugs. another gamemode is wasteland, an open world gamemode where you make money and fight other player. to wrap this up, i would definately recommend this game. great to play with friends.",6
"my second day playing it and already experiencing stupid bugs. some game controllers disappear after being killed in mp on win8.1 64bit. its beyond annoying and many people are experiencing similar issues.",1
"this game is great i love it. its cool how you can port jsut about everything form arma 2 to arma 3 and how bis put were you could change your outfit. a must have!!!!!!!! and the modding coummity is over the top with mods",5
"good game. can do almost anything thanks to the modding support. i strongly recommend altis life, a3wasteland, and possibly arma 3 epoch when it gets out of alpha.",3
"best looking game of the year so far, not to mention great gameplay",1
"dont buy if u dont owna $500 to 600 gpu or it in sucks",1
"altis life in a nutshell: -takes 150,000$ out of his atm to go buy a helicopter -gets stopped and robbed all my money on the road to the airport -goes back to the copper mine to earn money -gets stopped and robbed by a kid admin, except i already got robbed before so i had 0$ -asks me if i could drive him somewhere -i insult him and i drive off -kicked by admin, reason: being rude 10/10 would get robbed again",1
"have you ever seen a platoon of soilders advancing towards the enemy by shuffling on thier butts, legs stretched fowards? no? well now you can! experience the ultimate leaning and awkuard stance simulator, arma iii promises to deliver the biggest  raping any game has ever given to you. and i promise you that when you see the enemy you will  all kinds of runny solids, because these arent just regular guys, these are regular guys dressed up in futuristic bug suits, they have party ballon animals, they have goats and they have weird helmets. buy now or forever be dissapointed that you didnt get to experence dragging your  all over the 19km island of stahpthis.",2
"great gameplay, great visuals, sounds, and the two new islands are frankly wonderful and huge. in my opinion the most noticeable improvement since arma 2 is that we are now evolving into some realistic and visually credible open world, as opposed to the narrow places kinda looking like more or less similar checkpoints in previous games. the gameplay adjusts extremely well to the new terrains, making arma 3 something closer to an actual simulation than just an advanced fps with milsim elements into it. however, it is impossible to talk honestly about arma 3 without telling what hurts most: the lack of vehicles (planes notably, but not only), the lack of weapons and few annoying ai pathfinding issues (sometimes even on places where all should normally go well). that being said, i personally can see an insanely great potential behind arma 3, and the way it will continue to evolve will in my opinion probably make it simply one of the best game ever created. all it needs is some more time to grow up.",9
"why buy h1z1 when you can play battle royale on this puppy without having to pay $7/month later?",1
"i have heard many things about this game such as its poorly optimized or its too laggy. yes it is poorly optimized in some situations but when it comes to graphics, knowyour computer specs and dont argue when it lags because you bought the game without looking at your computer specs and noticing their bad. in my opinion this game is very fun. it is a very realistic game because crashing a car that your in will hurt you. getting shot in the head will kill you. when sniping there is bullet drop. i love this game not only for its graphics, but mostly for the gameplay. i will note that i reccomend having friends to play with on the game because its not so fun alone. well at least there are some nice people in the game, others willbe totlal douches as a teamate. i love to play gamemodes such as king of the hill, wasteland, and battle royal but not so much. i will rate this game a 8.25/10 due to the lag even on low setting. also if you have the settings too low for your computer, the game will lag, i can play this game at 50fps on ultra settings.",6
"it is really a great ecperience with friends and foes it gets my vote that is for sure",1
"probably one of the best games i own, everything about this game is great! 10/10 if i could i would  this game!",1

"my first day playing a3 was awfull now i just cant quit ,its too good its as good as it gets now i know why ppl call it an army simulator cus it is",3
"this game is amazing,if you like military simulators this game has it all from realistic gun play and simulator controls for air vehicles. also what this game has that the other fpss lack (bearing in mind you can play in 3rd person) is the vast community with community made gametypes such as altis life in wear you play as a cop, civilian or rebel in a huge roleplaying surver.or wasteland where you scavenge for loot in a mass sandbox map killing other survivors on site or you if thats not enough you can download scenarios (single missions built by the community in editor) in which you undergo a mission that someone else built! and if all of this is not enough you can even download the breakingpoint mod, a dayz esc mod with the polished look and features! there is also a very rich campain if your looking for a single player experience. hand down the best game i own to date i seriously reccommend this for any true gamer. master piece!",3
"fun game its best played with friends though however it does feel very realistic and it takes a bit to get used to if ur used to more close ranged fps",3
"the closest thing to real life firefights that ive seen to this day.",1
"this game is full of bugs. the ai is either thicker than door posts and couldnt hit the side of a barn with a shotgun, or supersnipers with laser xray vision. glitches abound, gameplay is like wading through liquid latex. optimization will leave you thinking microsoft, intel, amd, and bohemia interactive are all conspiring to make you buy the latest liquid cooled 10 000thz cpu, nvidia/radeon gtx 9999 in crossli with ram up the ying yang. buy it. seriously. it will disappoint so badly, but give you so much satisfaction, that you will overlook all of the above and become addicted. i know i did. and then....karts. seriously?! from a dev who listens to its supporters a milsim dev. that creates absolutely peurile sidesteps. instead of working on fixing stuff that is actually wrong? karts?!! w.t.f? i am so disappointed i want my dragon rising to cry me a red river. codemasters...dirt....i see you on the horizon.",5

"doesnt run that well when playing multiplayer because for some reason they thought itd be a good idea to load the entire map... kinda the same mistake unity made by having 12,000 npcs on screen at once.. so its not a bad game at all, very fun and good looking when the game runs smoothly however if youre looking for a fun military simulator that you can play then you might wanna buy arma 2 instead. so its not that i dislike this game, i have a lot of fun with it its just that sometimes i have to run it on low to play it at 30fps at most. i have gtx 970 if anybodys curious so yeah, 7/10. wouldnt recommend, but its a fun game still.",1

"very fun game, and gets better with higher graphics. if your computer can run games with really high graphics, and you enjoy playing games like arma, then definately go for this game. my pc has decent specs with minor touch-ups here and there, and it ran fine for me during the one weekend it was free to play.",1
"buy one game and thanks to the countless mods, you get several different games. best video game purchase i ever made.",4
"arma 3 is the perfect driving simulator if you are a woman. if you are a man, you will hate how feminine your driving will become. flying helicopters is just like it used to be, hilariously dangerous for everyone around you. the only problem with the game is the map. the only problem with bohemia is understanding what optimizing means. 9/10 milky ways suck",1
"its a damn amazing game so much fun, when your roleplaying, fighting or just playing zeus with your buddies i do feel they tried to soak up money with the helicopter dlc but personally i dont mind they do need money for a new engine which im sure they will try to make. when your roleplaying speeding from the popos in yer trusty hatchback yeling cya m8 then when you come back around you wheels get popped and your car just stops you just go like .... oh my god d: run it has a very very big and challenging campaign depending on the difficulty your playing at personally im finding the campaign to be alot of fun! and the battles on altis life rpg the battles just ok ok ok this game has so much content cons - old bohemia engine - helicopter dlc was said to be free but then when it came out ._. - yeaa i cant think of much else 10/10 100/100 1000/1000 213819273123712738973/10",6

"seriously, its not your average battlefield or call of duty shooter... far from! this is real war simulation what all possible factors included! if you want to wage war like a real soldier in life-like situations, this is a game for you. this game however has many different controls and doesnt exactly have a user-friendly control because you need to press multiple buttons mostly to even execute one action, apart from basic movement and such, but if youve ever played any other bohemia interactive game, you should already know that. other than these hard-to-master controls, this game is truely amazing, breathtaking, and even lets you use an editor for putting together your own missions. i personally like it for combat flight simulation.",1
"a realistic army sim, not for the kids that enjoy call of duty. bloody amazing though.",1
"a well made military simulator with a great community. the game puts you right in the action during those tense moments when the bullets flying around you could kill you in one or two hits, making every battle decision worth thinking over. missions with a team could never be more realistic then when you are just a band of gamers who have never met before, hunched over your computers and just barely making a dent in the opfor forces. even when you are on the move to the action, the game still keeps your attention. the moments when you are completely oblivious, then suddenly ragdoll to the ground with the respawn screen popping up really teach you to be aware. overall, arma iii is an amazing game that made a lasting impression on me, considering im new to the series. originally buying it to play altis life, i soon found the rich treasure trove of content this game holds.",2
"great multiplayer. massive open world and a lots of oppertunity. this is war",3
"cant join any servers anymore. 10/10 wouldnt join again!",3
"only to angry people that are pashent not x call of duty players because that s^*(ts fake arma 3 is the defnation simulator game!",3
"attempted to fly a helicopter and immediately crashed into my teammates. 10/10",1
"awesome game. great simulation progress, and great for people who have an imagination and like to great their own modifications and missions.",9
"beautiful, complex, difficult and advanced. many things can be said about arma 3 but one thing is for sure. when you get a group of friends together for some missions, its very fun and entertaining. on the downside is the learning curve, which is long and the game lacks a tutorial wallktrough. atleast i havent found one. ive never played arma or arma 2 either, which problably makes my period of learning even longer.",1
"great game, would reccomend for anybody. just read the requirements or you might be a game you cant run -_-.",5
"this games interface is horrible it is not intuitive or natural by any means. would have loved it if the interface was more like battle field 4. also the game feels very choppy and i am not referring to frame rate. i guess you either love this or hate it do not think this is anything like any other shooter game. i am sure the game will appeal to fans of the previous releases but at this stage i feel like i wasted my money",1
"one steam review for this game was as follows: cod = kids battlefield = big boiiz arma = men if, like that reviewer, you feel that your manhood is at stake, you might be willing to convince yourselves (and vociferously attempt to convince others) that this game is great. the tedious gameplay would be tolerable if not for the truly awful ui. maybe it makes you a man to want a game in which you crawl through grass for 20 minutes before being shot by a sniper from 1km away, so you can start the mission over. or maybe its the experience of trying to navigate poorly designed context menus when someone is getting ready to shoot you in the face, or being set back an hour of gameplay because of an invisible toggle that was on the wrong setting. this is a game for people with egos that need stroking, who think bad interface is the same as challenging gameplay, and dealing with it makes you manly. and i suppose that is a lot of men. but not this one.",1
"nice graphic, gameplay is pretty good. story/missions not so if you are looking for a singplayer game dont buy this game. all the fun is really in the multiplayer. a lot of different gamemodes and servers. singleplayer: 4/10 multiplayer: 9/10 all in all: 7/10",2
"game crashes a lot but its fun. stop crashing pls.",1
"abit buggy, but extremly fun! join the funest atlis life server: 1) go to the multiplayer server search 2)remote 3) type in 74.122.192.171 and port 2302",4
"i got pinned down in a firefight for half an hour, got shot once in the leg, crashed a jet into my teams base, then i started playing arma 3 and i thought it was ok 8/10",2
"same ole arma, if you enjoy the series, its worth a buy. active multiplayer community",5
"the keybinds and controls are so absolutely garbage i honestly believe the develeopers are trying to troll. hands down, the most unintuitive and convoluted shooter ever. i have never before played a game and actually wished it had a how to play tutorial.",1
"this game is a military simulation game, it will put into perspective a better way the militay (especially the front line infantry and spec. ops. soldiers) work and gives you a more realistic world to play on. everything about this game is about being tacticle and smart not just rush and shoot like call of duty game or even battlefield game do. the campains are long and more difficult especially considering you dont get superman health. if you get shot 2-3 times or sometimes even once, then you are dead. explosives are more realistic in thier lethality and distance of effectiveness. you can customize your weapons and character on the go also, by simply picking stuff up off of the people that have been killed (if youre into that sort of thing [i just replenish ammo if i can get it]). the multiplayer is also completely different from other fps multiplayers, it is an experience that you just have to try, and the graphics are amazing! rating: 10 out of 10",1
"when i played arma 3 during the free weekend a few weeks ago, i enjoyed it a lot and i also like the graphics and the interface. it really fits in with the players. altis life rpg - definitely recommend it, go play it...",1
"went into a multiplayer server, started a smoke grenade rave at the ao. got teamkilled shortly after. 11/10",9
"very neet military game ever developed. extremly good to create you own army :) and play it with many steam friends.",1
"same engine, just prettier with future caseless weapons and underwater shenanigans. not worth it, keep playing arma2.",1
"complex, difficult, but extremely rewarding. great campaign, lots of mods and things you can do to it. really shines when played as a group!",1
"this game is just as incredible as arma 2. the only thing i do not like about it is its extremely infantry based, with little combined operations.",3
"amazing game. new to the arma series and its the best realistic fps game to date. 10/10 c: more cpu hungry then gpu, just an fyi.",1
"cant run it on my dell laptop well but from the little bit that ive played it its pretty fun i guess",1
"best military game ever! there are very interesting mods out there, from altis life over breaking point to epoch. try it!",4
"got in a chopper so pilot fly team to the lz , got crashed by the same damn chopper and pilot 10 times a in row , then i gave up on the game and went to play epoch , got bashed in face for clothes , then i decided delete the game , but then i just realized , isnt these things what makes arma way more different than other shooters ? would die again before doing anything again 10/10 .",1
"good game yes it is headed in the wrong direction however because it is going down the same track as most mmogs they are asking to much money for the simple things in the game that should be part of the game for free not to long a go it cost $90 or so for any game and you had funn for a long time now the greedy bean counters want it all killing the gaming industry and making it for the rich in most cases not all cases the not so well to do games do not cost much the top end stuff costs to much.",3
"really realistic, if youre looking for an indepth immursive military simulator, or you just want army vehicles to blow up, this is your game.",3
"greatest military game i have ever played. realistic physics, vehicles, aeroplanes, jets, etc. it is extremely fun to play with friends, especially on custom gamemodes like altis life, epoch, wasteland and others. almost every building is enterable and detailed. the community make this game fun, and never ending. you can always do something new! 10/10",1
"love this game could play for the rest of forever just need to make the dlc free and add in new gun skins aswell as new air/land/sea vehicles. other than this its a beautifull game.",9
"i would totally recommend this game for those who have the money :p",5
"amazing, it makes you feel like youre actually there and youll be running whenever you hear explosions and gunshots and you will probably be hiding and taking shots sometimes. best experience ive had with any game, get it on sale though because 36 quid is quite alot.",3
"love this game so much,but you will need a goog computer",4
"this game is pretty fun. the game types you will have the most fun with is probably any type of life server. epoch is also fun, but what out for the exploding zombies. and finally king of the hill, this game type is the kind that most people play because its the most competitive. nevertheless, you should get this game. have fun with it.",1
"i love this game well worth the 30 bucks from steam sale",6
"pretty basic until you get mods for it. find a good community of gamers who game regularly and with good mods and this becomes one of the best games youll ever buy. im going to fail my degree because of this game. 10/10",7
"it is an amazing game with alot adventures and amazing graphics it is worth more than 36 pounds in my opinion i reccomend this game to every person that likes roleplaying flanking and doing epic things",1
"very good game the graphics are overall amazing.the gameplay is very smoth for me.i always have the now and then crashes but other then that amazing game!",2
"i loved it, i really did but battle eye destroyed my fan with a global ban to the fase after i did nothing",1
"i definitely appreciate the vast amount of badass simulation elements there are in this game, however at this point in tme what needs to be fixed is the relatively low variety of weapons, enemies/allies/civilians, etc. that makes arma 2 so much fun in editor. still, 4/5 get it.",1
"arma 3s features in comparison to the previous arma is sustantial. npcs no longer have extremely odd path finding patterns, and animations are much smoother. the recorded voices for commands and such are more lively and smoother. npc dialogue or qeued dialoge seems more in-tone with the situation. command voices for specific objectives run smoothly, and actually sound more pleasent. bohemia interactive really showed what they can do this time. 5/5",1
"so far only played the epoch mod. tried the campaign and as soon as im done with the tutorial, i recieve an error message. tried reinstalling the game and deleting the mod files. still doesnt work. but the mods make up for that so id still recommend this game but wait till its on sale, steam always has sales.",1
"hello, very good game if into simulation and also it relates very well to real life, this game is very mod flexible and there have been alot of mod releases latley e.g. arma 3life milsin units and all of that sort of stuff that takes the modding cabablilties very far with this game",8
"quite possibly the most in depth shooter ive ever played, even in alpha stage it still blows me away. the graphics are insane, the guns feel realistic, the movement system is revolutionary, and its just too much fun.",1
"this is the game ive been waiting for. everything i loved about arma 2 with hugely improved engine and animations and unlimited potential for unique missions and gameplay. i got arma 2 for dayz, but i got arma 3 for arma! best. game. ever... :)",2
"with the amount of community support, this game is a must buy.",3
"this game is a good leap from arma 2 but i want the building a base and defend it from your fo ...... ya i know there is mods that allow you feel that but they should of have it in the venlla game ...... but its great awasem graphics and game play.",1
"this game is hours of endless possibilities if you put in what you want to get out. best shooter of my lifetime.",2
"er-ma-gurd get this game, cant stop playing, best army simulator, so fun get it now",1
"love it currently at 342+ hours if you loved arma ii you will definetly like this!",4
"youll shoot your eye out kid! well, maybe if you could figure out how to shoot.",1
"great military simulator and an amazing followup to arma 2 8/10",1
"this is possibly the most realistic and entertaining military simulator ive ever had the joy to play. my absolute favorite part is the flying. the planes and helicopters in this game fly better than any flight simulator ive seen. i have only experienced a fraction of the game, yet im already hooked. creating missions is very fun, but it takes a little bit to get used to the mechanics. i highly recommend this game. 9.99/10",1
"if you havent already bought this game, its a must buy!!!! its 40% off atm get it while you can!!!",6
"1. fix the ai intelligence 2. fix the neck rubberbanding 3. fix the fatigue 4. fix bugs such as not being able to heal and forced walking",2
"although it may still only be in a disguised beta sort of stage,its still immensly fun when you hop onto a multiplayer server (try invade and annex which is what im referencing here) hop into a formed up squad and clear aos with the help of coordinated allies. zeus is also incredibly fun if youre into dropping people into s**t storms. the ability to basically create your own batles is a very fun concept indeed. workshop intergration allows mission creators publish their stuff easier and more people have more acess to it. if you want to buy it or not, i dont mind but you definetly keep your eyes on arma if incase something makes you just suddenly get the urge to buy it (like many, many mods) and i hope to see you on the field.",7
"great game. desync kinda kills it, but all the fun you can have in altis life/wasteland pretty much makes up for it. the voice acting is pretty bad, but i dont really play the game for the campaign anyways :p 8/10",2
"1-10 fps on medium settings, waste of money and time.  dlc pratices include sniper bipods and helichopter gunner slots.",1
"think if skyrim and battlefield had a baby and then it started doing meth.",1
"most realistic shooter i have ever played...and thats a lot.",8
"put this game on sale again do it now please now do it ple",1
"this is a truely good game that will take hours of your life. you can play the campaign wich is fun but you can also play the multiplayer that has all from user generated funny stuff too realy realistick battels/missions",1
"the server browser sucks , it cuts out your internet everytime you refresh the list of servers and the game is poorly optimized, but once you actually get into the game it is a lot of fun.",2
"amazing game it is very realistic and very awesome i recommend it",6
"it took me couple months to master all the commands and controls etc ,but after that the sky is a limit ,10/10 comrade stalin approves !",7
"i would suggest you dont buy this game and just go play other stuff and try to be happy because quite frankly it gave me the worst gaming experience ive ever had after 12 years of gaming.",1
"alot like arma2, graphics and some very slight phisics updates. though these games usually improve with age.",2
"this is by far the best military game ive ever played; if you have money to spend and a good rig; buy this game",1
"my most anticipated releas eof the year! after being an arma 2 junkie for years this fulfills my wishes and brings the arma series to the modern age, also i have to add that this game is probly the most beutiful game ive seen to date. highly modable, sandbox, multiplayer experiance. 10 out of 10 !",3
"the engine looks nice, but based on the older operation flashpoint engine still. entering houses feels iffy and like walking around on honey - god forbid going prone in one... its like the house knows judo.",1
"arma 3 is a nice improvement from arma 2 however it can still be improved on, regardless of that its well rounded and nicely polished for what its worth, you can get hours of fun online in multiple game modes or you can play a nice military simulator campaign, there is also the editor which you can mess about with and create your own user made missions and just have pure fun in.",2
"not a huge fan of this game, but....i am really liking the breaking point mod for it. is it worth $60 ? not for the game, but for the mod, it could be close. keep an eye out on sales for arma 3, get it then, and immediately download the breaking point mod. much better",1
"a amazing game, good gameplay. love it, keep up the good work!",8
"very good. all that running in this game is good for your thighs and heart. and lungs. 100000000000000/10",1
"realistic weapon sounds good graphics (for today) you feel like a real soldier in the war - in this game . good game.",1
"one of the best militiary based games out there. action packed and is worth the $50, numerous amounts of mods aswell.",4
"brillant, keeps updating and never gets old, easy to mod",7
"ok this game require to train to fully appreciate it value. the game is not hard but its unforgiving. you will die a tons! it make dark souls look like candy crush. but take the time to learn how to pilot, how to command and install some recommanded ai mod like ffis and i promise you a superb gaming experience. arma3 is unique! but you will never forget your first success. this is no wonder why the community is so productive with this game. you really can simulate anything! just take the time to learn it! its a sure buy ! the only con against this game ? it require a monstrous pc to be played correctly i run a i7 4930k/32gig@2400mhz/2x ati 7970 on an 2560x1440 screen and this is not very fluid i often run between 40-60 fps but nothing more. because the pace is rather slow the fps slowdown is not really a big issue. just be aware of its hardware requirement",1
"this game will make you love it. then it will kick you in the nuts and you will hate it. then you will love it again",2
"aema 3 game is a very good game for its graphis nad visual thanks",1
"arma 3 is a really good game. if you feel like a real army game, go and play arma, good tactics etc makes your team win. for the roleplayers out here, they are also at the right addres, arma has an rp mod called altis life this is fantastic for people who love rp with good graphics. i really recommend this game for actually every player who loves an army game and for people who seek real roleplay",4
"i highly recommend this game to anyone who really loves fps/third shooters and anyone who loves hardcore combat! there are sstill glitches of course... the multiplayer is awesome. singleplayer is awesome. everything about dlc missions and the dlc packs are awesome! i also recommend this to anyone who loves arma or big open world games!",3
"probably the best purchase of a game ive made in a long time. theres so many different modes, there is literally something for everyone. picture this: youre moving forward as a patrol, scanning the area of rakka as you walk the dusty roads in a collumn. suddenly, tracer fire flies right by you, and your ic is hit, the combat medic crawls to him, but suddenly he is hit as well. youve got a choice: drag either of them to safety and patch them up, or dive for cover. being a hero, you naturally grab your medic, with the intent of reviving him and getting to the ic asap. however, some dumb er in truck comes screaming up the road, stops next to you to help. he doesnt. the enemy cas locks on to the active hunter, and lets off rocket-powered fury. your screen goes red, in the bottom left: [5r] sergeantplant was killed. its all good though, you respawn and set off on another patrol. seriously though, buy this game, it is so varied, and theres so many mods available as well. the community is brilliant, both in clans and on forums like reddit.",2
"man, doe be like comin out of the trees and , and you be all like oh mayne, who hims that? you that and your team all like nah, it aint me, but it do and you like yah, it do and then you both shoot him and , people droppin all around, man with helichopter come in all shootin missiles and , blowing up children and you like yah, but there is the cav and everyone else dying, but you not. nah, you not.",2
"spawned killed many civs were the gun shop was then i saw one getting held up so decided to be nice so i shot the bad guy took his stuff nice gun btw then blew the civs head off with my favorite gun the m1911 *bam* he fell to the ground dead will do this again but i was kicked off the server 10/10",1
"pros - fun editor good multiplayer nice community good devs cons - fps lag if you dont have a amazing computer hard too solo - multiplayer over all 9/10",4
"great simulator when you are playing with people who are serious, organized and actually simulate warfare - horrible piece of  when you verge off that track (go karts? wasteland? and other stupid game modes along with a bunch of dayz hungry kids and immature 12 year olds). mods enhance the game as which it did for arma 2. coop is very good for when i said organized but can sometimes just consist of idiots running around and lone wolf sniping.",4
"for people who like simulations this is an excellent choice you make, from my personal view, its the most realistic game ive played yet, even though its a game and it isnt yet possible to make it more realistic, it is a really nice game and its money well spent if youre looking for has i stated before, a simulation game",4
"if you are looking for a tictical military simulation get arma 3",1
"waay better than call of duty its awsome. if you love open world milatary games that are realistic buy this game now",5
"a very fun game if you can find the right people to play with, you can do missions like battle royale, wasteland, altis or maybe stratis life idk do what you want. 150 hours means its over 10 stars. its outstanding the graphics somewhat the physics bohemia interactive yet have to figure out the physics other than that buy it.",5
"its not optimized... no fun playing at 20fps always while on online servers. i would say, spend your money else where. it could be fun if they ever fix the framerate issues but i doubt they will. i think id have to be honest and say i dont recommend this game because of that.",1
"this is the best sandbox shooter i played in my life you definitely have to try this one with a mod like wasteland",6
"best first person shooter ive ever played! challenging, realistic, wide open,you name it... its in this game. even vehicals got their realisticness maxed out!",1
"love this game , great community and people have the best of servers. the a3l stolen stuff drama is fun to watch ;) love a bit of drama , great altis life servers out there and also some amazing mods to play with. i am aiming to finish the campaign soon since im finding it semi difficult but i will get there ;p 10/10 would bang again play*",5
"a game that has no equal, there really is nothing quite like arma.",5
"had a great experience in this game,plenty of details in arma3,so impressive!",1
"great game would recomend that anyone who is anything should buy this game.",1
"an amazing military sim with so many possibilities it is up to you to decide how to play, wether it be to mess around with the editor, the so far wonderful campaign or different team based games in multiplayer. its a definate recomendation",2
"you can pick apples!!!!!!!!!! you cant do that in any other game can you",1
"while crawling at the amazing forest enjoying sights youre spotting an enemy in a bush 5 meters from you. youre making a 3 well-placed shots right into his unprotected face from your heavily modded fictional mxc(whatever that means). blood animation confirms that youve been successful. enemy runs into the other bushes. he probably heavily injured.. this is what arma3 is. unpolished, unfinished game with fictional weapons on a map that makes you feel yourself an alien. they should really expanded eastern europe theme instead = arma 2 wasteland > arma 3 wasteland",1
"arma 3 is a that you play with friends and other people and have a great time on lan or online.",1
"this game is one of the best that i have played, it has unlimited playability, great gameplay, and amazing graphics. what makes this game have unlimted playability is ita ingame editor where you can design your own missions and then upload them to the workshop if you choose or just keep it for yourself. this game is also the most realistic war simulator on the market because of its large maps, weapon physics, amazing ai, and its wide range of weaponry and tactics. this game is by far the best shooter you can get right now and i highly recommend it.",4
"very good game just need to fix bugs i recommend it to all",1
"you dont buy crack for sometime in the future just like you dont buy arma if you plan on going to work the next day...",4
"fun as everything run nicely and the workshop items are pretty dam good",1
"the only game series which is progressing from installment to installment instead of degrading.",2
"nice game xd best review ever. but anyways i recommend buying arma! :d",5
"its just a terrible battlefield where you get lost because the map is so fukking huge. gun mechanics are cool, but who cares if you never use it? i spent five hours running around up and down hills before shooting one dude. he was afk. just go play counter-strike. 4/10",1
"very good game with alot of mods that you can play with yourself and friends!",3
"much like its predecessor, arma 3 is an outstandingly good game. the sandbox action and incredible battles that the player can create are absolutely brilliant, and its great graphics also provide a treat for the eyes. that being said, i cant recommend it entirely. the amount of realism is a bit too much, and i guess thats the dilemma with shooters. theres one series that makes about as much sense as the plot of batman & robin, a totally unrealistic game; but with this, its like, you walk 10 feet and then you have the aim of an imperial stormtrooper. also, the amount of keys it has is a bit too much to bear at some times, and configuring them can be an absolute nightmare. my ultimate verdict is that i recommend arma 3, but there are still some things that i dont really like about it. im not attempting to ward off potential buyers, but just know that every rose has its thorns.",3
"very strategic and requires skill more than anything.",3
"sp or anything that isnt a mod is a no go, wish i could have given my cash to a few mod devs instead! if you do have it you should definately get the breaking point mod, plays better than the rest of the game. *update as of 1/13/15* still a better flight sim than a tactical shooter by far...",6
"ran than jumped off a stone wall than flew like supa man than flew to my death 11/10 best game na",1
"my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game, ever. were on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. im leading a team of 4 men. we come to a crossroad and i sprint across, telling my men to hold back. i cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. nothing. i run, my saw gunner runs, my medic runs. but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across. anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through? remember the sniper scene? the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down. he then takes two more in the chest. the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. he screams as hes being shot. crawling, drenched in his own blood. sarge? you aint leaving me out here like this, right? i-i wanna go with you guys! cmon sarge, h-help me! cmon! please dont leave me! he died after that. i cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.",3
"this game is fun, looks great, and is just straigh up awesome. pros: graphics new vehicles new weapons sounds gameplay large maps ability to customize your weapons attachments ways to store more gear other than a backpack. ability to move fast while prone/ do other things while prone (inventory, heal yourself etc.) cons: it may seems like it is laking content, but there are a lot of things to do not as big of a population in players that there was in arma 2 the npcs dont seem to notice you as often so you can really just shoot them a lot w/out being shot at unless youre really close. this game still has more to come and i would recommend it.",1
"arrested a guy in altis life for going 1kph over the speed limit. 10/10",2
"a great game, and great break away from the aa mainstream games like cod and battlefield",1
"amazing game love it, can be rage inducing at times, but in the end its all for good times, and good memories. 10/10",7
"if theres ever been a game for everyone its arma 3. the graphics are spactacular and the engine never stops amazing me. there are many multiplayer modes that inculde everyone from king of the hill to altis life the glories are endless! 10/10",2
"coming from a very extensive flight sim background, i generally expect too much from games these days. having the whole planet at your fingertips flying from city to city, country to country... high fidelity aircraft systems correctly simulated.. it sure sets a high bar! but arma 3 leaves no part of me unsatisfied, the immersion factor is brilliant and playing with the right people very professional! i definitely recommend!",2
"hour after hour the game can be enjoyable to an extent but with the serious lack of software support from bi-studios the game is lackluster in how it performs compared to its previous game. they still since the launch of alpha have yet to create a patch for a simplistic bug and are lazy programmers in the least. it seems that the modding community has to pick up the slack of their terrible coding to fix not only simple coding issues but also the major areas just to be able to have good mods...... pretty horrible if you ask me, i would have expected alot more coming from bi-studios.........",5
"arma 3 is in some aspects better than arma 2 but worse in other aspects. pros -smoother controls compared to arma 2 -editor is even more versatile now -vehicle handling is now more realistic -flying seems to be improved -you can change your guns attachments on the go -the new uavs are neat -you can change your clothes (aka play dress-up) -ai has been improved cons -the soldiers seem to be too durable now (you can survive a 40mm grenade direct hit or 3-4 shots to the chest from a rifle) -the public server list is full of altis life,dayz and wasteland (and i dont have any friends that play arma 3 so i cant play private matches) -the new futuristic theme is plain boring -a lot of guns appear under fake names -there are not a lot of vehicles",1
"very high quality. outranks cod, battlefield, and moh in my book.",1
"so once youve figured out what the  youre doing youll like this game, if not then go play some call of duty.",2
"best game ever shoot many enemy wow. get apc sshoot many raket for enemy i like 5/5 only noobs and  dont recommind this game #yolo #sweg",2

"awesome game that makes cod and bf4 look stupid. if you have a lot of spare time on your hands then go for it. 9/10",1
"just buy arma 2, its performs better and doesnt have the bulk of its content locked behind dlc. also it doesnt crash nearly as much.",1

"one of the best shooter simulators out there with intense gameplay, great map and amazing graphics",1
"great game, so much to do with the new zeus mode patience is key to success in this game the game is graphically awesome at night time lighting is great overall fun game",3
"meh. unless your a really devote tactical millitary fps player this probably isnt for you",1

"love this game... good action and pvp... base building is nice... only downside id say is the early bugs.... and if you dont find a vehicle... you run.... if you can make it past them 2 downers this game is number 1... like battlefield and rust mixed... absolute love",8
"game is terrible...thats why its a free play weekend",1
"amazing game great core experiance with full modd support i recomend sixupdater some of the best editor and mission making out there ecpecialy with the new zeus tool. choose arma for you military sim needs",2
"one of the best shooters out there. on ultra graphics the game looks real. the combat is so open that it is diffrent every time. i put 12 hrs on this game the first day i got it. with so many game modes it never gets boring. 10/10",3
"why why why is this game so lagy i get 14 fps and i have a i7 4790k @ 4.7ghz and a msi r9 285 if i put all max i get like 14 to 40 fps on a good sever but wen i put all low i get 14 to 40 fps like wtf why is this game so bad like what do i need my pc cost 1,700$ like really and yall see why ppl go to consols fix this my god you have a very nice game and ppl still play it even if they only get 14 fps with the top of the line hardware this is ridiculous.",4
"arma 3 is a real game with all the workshop items and dlcs and game modes that expands the game i rate this a 10/10",1
"its like arma ii but better looking. and nicer looking. and overall better",1
"an absolute beast of a game. among campaign which ive never touched there is wasteland, altis life, battle royal/hunger games mod, and last but not least the infamous breaking point. i fell in love in wasteland, and loved this game even more in altis life, and then i played br and bp, and this game is absolutley one of my favorites of all time. especially among shooter games. it may be laggy at times, and even unbearable, and downright prude, but with friends you can have nothing but a good time. invest time into downloading teamspeak and unite with me and we will downright reek havok and tomfooleries among this whole game. i give this game a 9/10, only due to laggy and buggy servers at times, but besides all else this game can do nothing else but give you a good time.",3
"the game by itself isnt that fantastic. the graphics and gameplay are good, but it isnt worth the price. using the breaking point mod adds a whole new depth into the game and i would strongly recommend downloading it if you have the arma iii game. overall i recommend it because i havent regretted buying it for $60 and therefore hope you feel the same if you buy it. (best to buy it on special though)",1
"this allowdamage false; fatigue mechanic makes me want to punch children. aside from that, an updated engine which looks ten times better, and actually runs smoother than the a2oa engine. everything is much more fluid and smooth audio has recieved a major update too, weapons sound better, soldiers dont sound like robots. my only gripe is that im not sure how i feel about the game being launched in an unfinished state, theres still a bunch of base content on the way that was initially supposed to be able at launch. arma is what you make of it, you can use it as a toybox, or you could use it as a sprsrs tacticool dad game. works just fine for either",2
"like cod and battlefield you wont want to play them after playing this",1
"bought it back in april, pretty bad. gave it another shot in january, holy  it is good. the custom maps and content are amazingly fun and the campaign seems pretty good as well. the games controls are horrifyingly complex and non-intuitive and the game intself can be a little buggy seeming but the combat realism and graphics are so sexy. no shooter in recent years has provided me with the proper fear of that unseen sniper 800m+ away that arma 3 has. 9/10",4
"for sure one of the best games out right now. arma 3s attention to detail is just amazing.",2
"its quite a bare game for the price. but luckily theres tonnes of high quality addons out thare to make this game legendary. the campaign was tough... but unpredictable and awesome. the dlc is overpriced for what you get. and the editor is just as awesome as previous armas. 8.5/10... would arma again.",2
"feels wrong writing a review of this game now as its not finished. the engine alone is just limitless to what can be created. the online community is very active providing a mass of servers and different game types. overall awesome game and can only get better.",2
"very awesome game, simulates how war is very well, if you liked arma 2, you will love this. you can play online such as wasteland which is fun. ive had this game since they released it.",1
"for what this game tries to be (which is a war simulator) it fails misserably at that. the movement is clunky, the a.i is dumb and overpowered as hell. so if you get into this game being all like yeah, this is what war is like, this is realistic and really precise then sorry. you need to get out in the real world pall. because i dont consider a game that when you shoot the enemy in the head they are able to do a 180 turn and shoot you 3 times in the head before dying very realistic. same goes for boosting of stairs when walking down from them to quickly and breaking your legs. this game is however one of the funniest games i have ever played with friends. the amount of vehicles, the guns, the destructible enviorment. the overall map is not to shabby either. if you get this game for fun gags with friends and just cause overall chaos then this game is perfect for that. if you get it to play it as a serious war game then id say the clunky motions and faulty a.i ruins that emediatly",1
"there is alot of talk about how the souls games are some of the hardest games one can currently play. that is glossing over arma, these games are hard. overcoming thet challenges in any arma game are the most rewarding expeience i have had in gaming. this game is not for everybody but if you want to see a large battle unfold around you, or create that battle in the mission editoy arma 3 is a great platform for that. oh and on a quick aside this game has a incredible lighting engine, the dark of night time without night vision is amazing.",1
"i just bought this because of altis life and breaking point (and wasteland). 11/10 still best military simulator",3
"one the the best fps game i ever played no no no its thee best fps game i ever played. if u havnt dl yet i highly recommend to. hmu on steam if u want to squad up, iampandemic6.",4
"arma 3 has increased my sexual life ten fold and given me a new perspective on our lord and savior wilford brimley. 10/10",1
"the perfect way to play arma 3: 1: get 2 ugvs and a buddy. 2: tell your buddy to get into the first ugv while you get into the second. 3: control the ugv that your buddy was in while you have him control yours. 4: drive around like idiots",5
"arma iii has come so far from the alpha, to the beta, and then the full release. you will put in countless hours playing this game in a variety of modes you can play. with the modding community making amazing mods there will be endless options of playing the game. i definitely recommend this game for anyone that loves a military shooter.",4
"im not going to pay this money for this game - totally not, you shouldnt. 1st you should get a better gpu, and i mean a very good gpu, arma 3 still needs better optimization. 2nd wait for multiplayer fixes, it still has some desync insues here and there, multiplayer performance needs improvement. 3rd why do i need ot wait for multiplayer fixes when i can play singleplayer? - well arma is made for coop action, and by this i mean join a clan/ group/ unit that knows how to play the game correctly. 4th buy it and you will see it will be worth it!",7
"the campain is a major improvement compared to the missions from arma 2. also the overwhelming support from the mission and modding community adds seemingly endless posibilities for gameplay.",5
"if you are looking for a real challenging game i invite you to try arma 3 cause you will die more than once during the entire game and that is a fact, no matter how many fps you have played or action and strategy games they wont be too much helpful, you will almost need a real military training to play this game because its a war simulator and hell it is hard but fun. i did not have the chance to try the full game but from what i could its fantastic its an open world in which you need to find your way in to go though and there is not just one path. you need to take your own decisions of how you are gonna make one mission depending of your resources and plan every single move you make, otherwise you are welcomed to visit death,its like chess, if you did not paid attention to the moves of your opponent you will lose. you may be freely walking and up ahead there is a patrol that you did not see coming or you step over a landmine or even fall in your own traps which happened a lot times to me. yeah i know the game is frustrating but when you fit in the game it will be a different story. and lets not forget of the beautiful graphics and enviroment that the game offers. 10/10",1
"although this game does have its qwerks, like other arma games, the large scale and extensive detail in graphics makes up for it. the game offers endless fun and although is better with friends, you can make friends who play arma 3 all the time very easily. would recommend for anyone interested",2
"while arma 3 is a good game, it is still has issues. myself as well as a lot of other players have experienced multiple problems while playing, one such problem would be when we are launching the game, a message pops up saying handle is invalid. dont risk your $60 - $65 on a game that still has issues. dissapointing... edit: there have been a few things that i wish to add to this review. i think it was a poor decision on bis part to add dlcs that cost money with little content. the zeus free dlc/update hasnt done anything to the game multiplayer wise, the karts dlc looks a bit fun, but still needs more stuff, the helicopter dlc only adds 2 choppers and a few new gameplay mechanics that should have been in a free update, which costs $15. also, like i have stated before, my game often crashes on even at the lowest possible settings. im overall dissapointed in this game and its just a huge waste of money that could be put to games that are actually enjoyable and not riddled with bugs and costly dlcs.",1
"this is the first arma game ive played, the first milsim acctually, and its great ive been looking for a game like this for a while.",1
"extremely enjoyable game but its still arma and it still has the horrible desync and lagginess. altis life is extremely good except for some servers which have lots of bandits. normal campaign is quite fun but very time consuming. the challenges are good except a bit glitchy as you cant seem to complete some of them. other than that its a very solid game that you can put many hours into!",1
"very good and impressive, especially for me, im a not easily pleased when it comes to video games i would reccomend this to all my friends it made a big jump from arma ii",1
"arma 3 is a great game. is it the best shooter? no. it does however have many features no other shooter offers. the ability to switch views is neat, but the real difference is gun positions. to prone, kneeling, leaning on that fence, rolling on your side, high and low ready with slung. if this game had the money of bf4 or cod it would blow them out of the water. team coms and work mixed with the pure massive size of the maps work well. the other large draw is the mods. where else can i cook meth, have a shootout, steal a helicopter, get away. then take out the herion dealers with the helicopter. lose it in the fight and be gunned down after running 2 miles trough a mountain trying to avoid a manhunt. almost anything or scenario that is avaiable irl can be set up in here. there are some downpoints like bugs and glitches, but no major ones. some nights are an effort in frustraion while trying to get geared up, then killed soon as you do. best when played with friends.",2
"a virtual battlefield and simulation experience like no other since 2001 (op. flashpoint). and series, as arma, continues to evolve with this great, yet not perfect, title. enough said.",10
"if you love military simulators or just plain out love the military this game is by far the best out of any other game to play. i have played arma 2 and oa and ever since arma 3 came out i have not touched arma 2 or oa. this game has a learning curve but ask people in multiplayer or play the campaign for help. overall 10/10.",1
"great game, very poorly optimised though i am not getting good frames and there are no dayz servers in australia!!!",1
"ran into a teammate pilot yesterday who was jamming creedence clearwater revival through his mic while flying his helicopter. gave it that sort of feeling that you get from watching vietnam movies when he landed us in a hot zone. 11/10",1
"one of these best games out there. you do how ever need a strong pc to play on high graphics but even on the lowest setting i still love it. final grade 97/100 (for a few bugs that have only happened one)",1
"if you read this buy me this game it taughts me about writing a review but i cant play if you buy me this i will give a blow job.",2
"i recommend this game to anyone who likes a more realistic type of shooter. this game also has a big modding community so there are tons of different ways to play the game. controls are most fluid then arma 2 and it feels more natural and less mechanical. it does still have a slight mechanical feel but that just goes with the genre. every act requires you to take a second to complete that task just like rl. i didnt log many hours when i first got it but iv recently found servers that run the sc (sector control) game mode and its fantastic. you gain levels by being in the target sector and money to buy new gear. il keep this brief but its a great game and keeps getting better with every update.",2
"better than battlefield 4 and every other fps combined times 2",1
"youre paying 5 more than we did for alpha release. get it if you have the ram.",2
"addictive shooter, enjoy playing multi-player with your friends on custom servers and missions. endless fun.",2
"arma has long been one of my favorite modern military games. arma 3 started off rough but it is a very fun game for those who like that type. it is very satifying to play and the commuity of mods and addons is fantastic. the fact the game company allows so much modding is what makes this series great.",2
"really good game. heaps of mods and game modes comming out all the time. this game is a great investment for the future and i think everyone should have it in there steam library.",5
"very clunky game, not fully optomized yet in my opinion. requires a very high end pc and also requires dlc to play on most servers.",1
"great game. lots of mods. lots of multiplayer fun.",6
"pretty awesome game. make sure you have a high spec pc though, otherwise youll miss out on the best reason to own this game - them graphics guy!",1
"this game runs well, plays well, and allows me to feel immersed in a realistic military survival scenario. did not get to play it long during the free period so to speak, but at the same time i still enjoyed my experience. i definitely plan on purchasing this game in the near future when i get the chance",1
"needs more servers and players but overall its good",1
"one of the best pc games i have played only down sides are the optimisation is pretty bad but apart from that awesome game",4
"what has made this series so popular is the ability to mod it. the game by itself (talking about arma 2 and arma oa) are terrible games, but i have 100s of hours playing the modded versions of them, particularly the ace mod. since ace is not out for arma 3, and no sign of when it may come out, i cannot in good conscious recommend this game to anyone. the arsenal available in vanilla arma 3 is miniscule, and they have recycled a lot of graphical stuff from arma 2, making this worthy of the $20 shelf, not the current $60 price point. in summary, with ace out i would pay $60 for arma 3 today. without ace, only 2 maps, 2/3 of a campaign out, and no real game improvements coming from bohemian i would wait until this game gets to $19.99. update 22 july 2014. i can finally recommend this game again, since there are enough mods out there to once again make this game great. bi makes a poor game, the modding community makes it into a great game. while ace is still not out, there are other mods coming forward such as agm that make this game great. the weapon sway is completely broken without mods. as of this writing it is still $60, which is more than i would pay. pick this up on a steam sale for $30 or less.",4
"this game has a lot of potential. cant wait to see what becomes of it through the community.",1
"1. run cocaine wit ur bois 2. love your mother 3. make money 4. f**k bi**hes 5. ?????? 6. profit",1
"i would definitely recommend this game, if you are in to tactical  and great graphics. 10/10 stars",1
"a really fun game but the lag is deniably the worst! arma 3 is a very good military simulator but it still has that arcady feel to it which is not necessarily a bad thing. the only problem i have with this game is it gets boring very, very quickly!!! therfore i can not reccomend this game.",1
"this is one the best combat simulators ive ever played. the sand box on here is a blast and the steam work shop is awesome for user created content. the only down fall for me is that i dont have anyone to play this with.",4
"great game for realism, even more so if you have patience and friends to play with",1
"what has made this series so popular is the ability to mod it. the game by itself (talking about arma 2 and arma oa) are terrible games, but i have 100s of hours playing the modded versions of them, particularly the ace mod. since ace is not out for arma 3, and no sign of when it may come out, i cannot in good conscious recommend this game to anyone. the arsenal available in vanilla arma 3 is miniscule, and they have recycled a lot of graphical stuff from arma 2, making this worthy of the $20 shelf, not the current $60 price point. in summary, with ace out i would pay $60 for arma 3 today. without ace, only 2 maps, 2/3 of a campaign out, and no real game improvements coming from bohemian i would wait until this game gets to $19.99. update 22 july 2014. i can finally recommend this game again, since there are enough mods out there to once again make this game great. bi makes a poor game, the modding community makes it into a great game. while ace is still not out, there are other mods coming forward such as agm that make this game great. the weapon sway is completely broken without mods. as of this writing it is still $60, which is more than i would pay. pick this up on a steam sale for $30 or less.",4
"i recommend getting arma 2 instead, this one sucks",1
"the game is apsolutly awesome grapich,world.its bugged in 30 min gameplay once.second best arma game",1
"arma 3 is the best simulator out yet!!! recomended for everyone:d",10
"how arma 3 was made: producer: oh god no.... producer 2: what is it? producer: dayz has more plays then arma 2 does and in order to get more money we need money. producer 2: i have always feared the day this would happen. producer: what could we do sir? producer 2: i know! we could make arma 3! producer: but sir pepole more would still play dayz! producer 2: your right, have the introduction in a helicopter and make the campaign really small. producer: thats fantastic sir! producer 2: wait, im not done have lots of swear words. producer: swear words sir? producer 2: yes its very odd but pepole love swear words. producer: ill be right on it sir. and thus, arma 3 was made.",5
"iam in love...altis life....love it even more then dayz :o",2
"enough with arcadey nonsense. this is realistic combat simulator. mods are fun.",1
"a very,very,very good first person shooter war game it has so much possible controls that when first time playing i didnt know what what is xp",3
"was tazed by a cop for trying to sell illegal fedoras 10/10",2
"arma 3 is great when it runs as intended, the problem is when it doesnt it becomes some what unplayable. ill keep playing it (as you can see in my hours played) becuase its the only game that does what it does.",5
"this game includes everything you could want or need in a military simulator, plus the things you didnt get with arma ii, even though it was just as a fantastic game that were the two games (oa and the base.). pile on the bold face of a military sim mixed in with some arcadey gameplay and realistic graphics and features, and youve got a great game that everyone wants to play. rating: 9/10.",1
"great game, can have all out wars or simply moddify it to be a roleplaying game. but non to less its a great game with lot to do. zeus is a blast with friends making missons on the go.",4
"overall the game play is difficult and focuses on real life accuracy making the movement mechanics very frustrating to navigate. unless youre driving a land based vehicle, youre going to find piloting any aircraft a complete nightmare. the game looks great but has a very small variety of weapons to choose from, which in turn makes for some pretty bland game play. the enemies are all crack shots and can hit you from miles away even if youre in a concealed, prone position. i picked this up during a sale recently and still regret the purchase. lesson learned. will be avoiding any future bohemia interactive titles.",1
"this game is in full aaa price and you just stop making content for it and want to charge for dlcs? i hate you scammers!!! this game is terrible, there is a huge lack of content for the original price, the single player campaing sucks and the multiplayer modes are only created by the community, i thought bohemia had learned from arma 2, dont ever buy this game, unless you have  tons of money, you will be sick of it after one day.",3
"best game to ever be created especially if you have the kart dlc :d 9.333333333333/10 half life 3 confirmed?",4
"well arma overall is one of the greatest games ever made the one and only problem pretty much is the fact it has horrible optimization and requires a nasa computer to run but other than that its a 10/10 game for me",1
"this is a really good game, i enjoy playing this game loads. the amount of gamemodes is great as theres loads of things to do and popular gamemodes such as wasteland can give you hours of fun. worth the money 100%",3
"do you want a army simulator where the professional army personal cant run farther that just 10 seconds? this is your game!",3
"time has no value when playing this game, hours are mere seconds. its like a crack addiction, you cant get enough and you just dont know when to stop. 10/10",5
"good game im just starting to play the story but for some rerason when i try to play on a atlis life server i lag out and get disconnected.",1
"as buggy as the beta still is (as youd expect), this game has been more fun and engaging than any other new game ive played in the past 3-5 years. i almost never get to say this, but i am actually looking forward to the full release.",3
"for the small amount of time that i have played this game i have found it to be extremely boring and monotonous. you might think that it would be fun with zombies or karts or other stuff but no, its not. if you want to play a moddable game might as well play garrys mod, which is much much cheaper. the game is full of bugs and the controls are all backwards. half the time i find myself looking at settings when im actually trying to open a door. overall this game sucks and i reccomend that everyone steer clear from it. i also forgot to mention that it is poorly optimised. 9/10 if you want realistic 0/10 if you want fun",1
"the controls are doo doo, but with friends this game can be pretty fun.",1
"want to sneak around in a camo suit and sabotage the enemys base from afar? want to drive into the enemy base with a tank, pockets loaded with explosives and heavy weaponry? or do you just feel like transporting your allies to key strategic positions for today? well, the good news is that in arma 3, you can do all of that and more. this game was designed to be a sandbox military simulator, and it is just that. the beauty of it, is that its not locked to either small-scale fast-paced run and gun or massive scale 24-hour battles. it can be both those things, and everything in between due to fantastic modding and custom map-creation tools that every player has access to. i havent taken much of a look at the campaign, but to be honest, the arma series was never really created for its campaign. multiplayer is excellent, graphics are excellent. what else is there to say? just make sure you have a beast of a pc if you want to run it on ultra-high settings.",1
"great military sim. a step up in every way from arma 2:oa, and despite being very demanding of the pc, isnt quite as wasteful as arma2. it pulls of a lot more with a little more.",1
"great game found it hard to get into at first found it a bit of a tricky learning curve. since the bootcamp missions was added found it alot more easy to get into the game and im currently enjoying it.",1
"this game is amazing! i enjoy having the more realistic feel, while still maintaining the fun of murder!",1
"best game i have played give this game 10/10 would recomend to a friend fawking luv this game",9
"first arma game love it really easy to get into worth the money",1
"highly recommended! as no big fan of any fps genre, i found this release impressively beautiful, complex, and truly a representation of military simulation game were long to. my fascination to the series began when bi, together with cm in the old days released operation flashpoint, then the next release such as cold war crisis, the first armed assault up til the third installment. gamers with high preference of immersion and reality would actually addicted to this beta-state game; which will be developed more as the community demands more realistic, more challenging battleground. i recommend you buy it now, before its development completes and eventually released in full-version. cheers :)",1
"brought game. played campain. got the hang of it. becoming quite good. shooting enemies as my team cheers me on. a friendly tank runs me over 10/10",1
"good for battle royale, only if its hardcore/ zeus is worth trying it is awesome in my opinion, also epoch will be released soon so a3 is worth playing!",3
"i just brought this today and what the  it goes down 10 dollars!!!!!!!!! give me my 10 bucks back!!!!!!",1
"buy game to play altis life. finishes downloading. plays the bootcamp a little bit. has to download  tons of things and get all dlcs to play on a server. 10/10 would waste time again.",1
"great game with great potentional with the modding community. arma 3 engine in itself is an amazing engine with plenty of scripting opportunities for new developers and experienced ones. without the modding community i dont think this game would be as popular as it is, but with the modding community its amazing what they bring to the table in this open world military simulator. between altis life (best described as grand theft auto where humans play every role), to wasteland, and even ahoyworlds co-op capture gameplay, this game has definitive replayability. i really love the dayz epoch mod, and breaking point mod as they both bring their own taste of the post-apocalyptic mayhem to the arma 3 community. now i cant wait for the helicopter dlc and the markman dlc coming soon. realism in flying helicopters and additional mid to long range weapons will just be icing on the cake for this series, and the cake isnt a lie with this one.",8
"such a great game. once you get over the learning cure then its such a joy to play",2
"this might not be your game if the only fps you play start with battlefield or call, unless you only play on hardcore modes. if you like military sims, then this is the quintessential experience. you can devote endless hours playing this game with nearly endless options. bi supports its modding community and it is very expansive. they also occassionally have cash prizes for mods. unfortunately the modding community isnt well represented in steam workshop, but downloading mods from bis forums isnt difficult. there are some intuitive control issues with the ui, but its forgivable. i wish i had more time to give this game so i could join a group that plays regularly, like shacktac.",1
"a very nice game alot of mods the altis life mode is the best. i give it 9/10 .",1
"quite an amazing game. definitely one of the most realistic milsims out there that isnt marketed towards people that are actually in the military. (vbs2/3). definitely not everyones cup of tea, and community is pretty harsh on former cod fans, but once they realize that you hate cod youre welcomed. still, many tactical units out there, and some amazing community members that do amazing work.",3
"greates millitary sim ever made, if realism interests you then buy it. 11/10 would play again.",1
"fps is spotty, but with some work and knowledge, you can get it stable for your rig. all in all, really good.",1
"after 200 hours into this game and playing in the aplha i would still reccomend arma 2 there isnt as much in arma 3 as its counterpart way more items in arma 2",6
"great for people who like realism, lots of realism groups for you to join to do this on a large scale, it has a nice community and with the addition on zeus mode the game is pretty much an open sandbox world for mission creators to play with. would definately reccomend picking this up.",3
"finally a game worth spending my hard earned $60 on. a fun game! hate it when i take a bullet in the head, but hey, thats realism!",5
"best arma ever so many game types and weapons best open world fps/3rd",1
"went on a server. got kidnapped. was screemed at for 10 mins in arabic. told to run and got shot in the head. 11/10 would get kidnapped again",5
"walking through the countryside, hitching a ride on a helicopter for 10 minutes, and a whole lot of nothing happening all the time. just like real life, 10/10 would wander pointlessly for 2 hours again.",1
"enemy ai is amazing friendly ai is terrible love it",3
"overall a well rounded, well put together game with a vast community. whether its role-play, co-op, pvp, or pve the community has made and played them all. the game is constantly evolving and constantlly being tweaked and fixed. the progression on the game from alpha to the latest version is by far some of the best work and dedication i have ever seen out of any dev teams, even that of some triple-a titles. if youre looking for a serious gamestyle there are many different realizm groups around to show you the ropes. if your more of a relaxed weekend warrior, the winners of the make arma not war competion for multiplayer missions, kink of the hill has what your blood thirsty hands are looking for. from survival to out right blowing  up this is what your looking for!",6
"this is a beautifully detailed military simulation, but sadly quite a poor computer game. it demands a very powerful pc to run well, and it is not at all friendly to new players. there also doesnt seem to much hand crafted content besides the huge sandbox they created. for example, i remember playing several fun missions in the original operation flashpoint with my friends, but when i tried to play co-op with a friend in this new game, there was very little to choose from and some missions were very confusing.",1
"amazing i love it its so realistic :d would say its a amazing game.",2
"arma 3 is gr8 holp to see more games like this from u guys 11/10",2
"ever wondered how it feels to be a muscular, hard- operator? well too bad, youre a scrawny ing toy soldier with futuristic gadgets which does all the fighting for you so all you get to do is walk around in your undies while in base. i want a refund, this isnt what i payed for, even for an alpha. however, bis sure nailed that underwear buldge just right. 9/10 average rail-shooter.",3
"if you enjoyed arma 2 you will definitly like this one aswell. the graphics are really nice and the missions are awesome too. there are some nice mods aswell that will keep you play this game after you are done with singleplayer",2
"amazing game well worth the money, doesnt get boring with the amount of endless funny stuff to do, alot of mods and customization for game modes",6
"this game is fun. it has some pretty cool survival aspects and also has vehicles that arw somewhat stable. you should definetely buy the game if you have the spare cash :d",1
"could not complete the first level of single player 10/10",3
"ever wonder what its like to be in the military? well this is as close as it gets without killing uneducated village people who dont know better in the name of oil and terrorism. god bless america.",1
"brain damage isnt the word.. if you love walking about hill sides & empty towns for hours on end then by all means knock your self clean out. really good graphics, half decent engine but just awful gameplay. trying to even see who is launching nades and rounds at you is a fecking personal nightmare. could feel myself falling asleep in one game where a guy was flying for an hour with me in the back of a chopper.. and yes.. we met no enemy the entire time. 4/10 just for graphics",1

"now arma 3 is a awesome game but were here to talk about more than the fact its awesome, graphics are amazing well the way i can run it, arma 3 can bring someones fps to -100 depending on your comp. so if it is lagging i highly suggest you lower the settings down alot. what can you do on arma 3: you can do atlis life (alot of role play, it has a bank and cops so there you go), battle royale (hunger games but in arma 3), dayz brecking point (arma 3 dayz mod) now about brecking point its a pain just to login to it so i suggest you play atlis life and battle royale, and it is a 1rst/3rd person shooter i rather allways be in 3rd person for certin reasons that im not gonna disscuss. there is alot more gamemodes but those are my things. is it worth the money, depending on your comp. yes as allways my rateing for this game is 10/10 remember this is all my opion so do not think its all here. thanks for your time",2
"whats the diffrence between buying normal arma 3 and buying arma 3 digital deluxe edition because it seems you pay for 5 euros more for absolutly nothing.........",2
"the engine this game uses is still a joke. it runs horribly.",1
"while the ai can be a flaw, there are mods that fix that, and i greatly enjoy this game overall, its one of the best games ive ever played. 15/10 :3",1
"in my opinion, much better than any of the previous arma games. first and foremost where do i start? the animations, the graphics and the physics are all improved perfectly and it just feels like you are at war! the optimization gives you much more freedom to tweak graphical settings. the co-op just has to be the best feature, knowing that everyone depends on you and you depend on everyone as a team.",1
"hmm, i dont wanna say this but your dlc so f***ing expensive. 14 dollar for 2 helicopters? are you f***ing serious? i cant use mini gun in helicopter cause dont have dlc, what the f*** is this? but gameplay not so bad. i got a sniper i see bipod when ill use it. buy dlc marksman are you f***ing serious? i bought it 59.99 dollar. ill buy this helicopters? 14 dollar? its in your dream bohemia.",1
"severly clunky animations, appallingly bad gunplay and still buggy months after release, will never buy another game from this company that expects the modding community to produce content for them. it makes me sick that i actually spent money on this utter trash. so poorly optomized it runs under 60fps on a fairly high end system that runs bf4 on ultra at over 80fps.",5
"the most realistic military experience short of being dropped into a live warzone just got more intense with the go kart addon.",1
"arma 3 is a military simulator, it gives the game a very realistic feel to it but the only issue is the fact that the developers of the game break things quite often and dont fix them for extended periods of time. such as the new update that came out today.",9
"played co-op invade and annex last night multiplayer last night for the first time, told all of the other players that i was new, and many people were friendly with helping me out and showin me some tips. played for 4 hours, and love it already!",1
"really fun, a bit buggy, but not liike dayz buggy.",1
"if youve got a fetish for first person shooters and the military and happen to be rejected by a real life military branch or happen to be a mechanic or cook in the military then this game is for you. other than that, move along in your real life and join the military. if you cant and happen to be in a wheel chair and love the military then buy this game and dream.",1
"deffinetely the best game ive ever played. great to play with friends on wasteland mode. so much you can do",1
"this is a great game it combines a bit of the ace mod dayz loadout vibe and great graphics!",10
"steal team members heli, get shouted at, crash 10/10 ign- 1642bc",2
"amazing game! alot of different community made gamemodes available.",1
"this is a amazing game struggle to get bored off this game as there are so many mods you can play. theres day, wastelane, atlis life etc.... the campaign is a struggle and hard to complete. the gun effects and other effects are mint there game is so realistic its unreal rate this game 10/10",2
"if you are looking for a realistic military sandbox, then look no further than arma 3. from a mission editor that allows the player to create any scenario possible, to an extensive list of community mods and addons, the possiblities are endless. the developers do an amazing job of fixing bugs and fueling all players with new content, and will do so for the next few years for sure! 10/10",4
"this game is ing hard. 10/10 like skyrim with arma would play again.",1
"better than arma 2 betttere customization and graphiics loved it",3
"dont come here if you like to rush things. ignore the worthless metascore. the power in armas longevity is in the ultra powerful game editor giving players the ability to custom design every aspect of the game, the missions, design/build weapons, anything you can imagine is possible in arma 3 and amazing directx 11 gfx. with arma editor, only your imagination is the limit. it is possible to simulate and relive just about any (tactical) situation imagineable. six to ten years from now, youll be playing arma. you will keep coming back to arma, long after you have completed and forgotten loads of other games. im a operation flashpoint veteran, the grandad of arma 3 that appeared in 2001.",2
"simply amazing. fun to play insurgency and king of the hill",3
"the leader in military simulator third installment arma 3 arma 3 has so much content that you will keep coming back. with a dynamic campaign that is influenced by the players actions and a user friendly editor for custom single player co-op and multiplier missions. armaholic supplies the player with one of the biggest modding communities and content that is almost endless.",9
"great all around combat sim. if youve played arma since the beginning then im sure your loving this one too. if you havent played arma then, well, what the hell are you waiting for!",7
"running around aimlessly through miles of durka-durka land squinting your eyes for multiple hours trying to find something that moves. once you do, you find out that you need to reload your gun and you get shot a million and a half times. i like this game. it is fun.",1
"this game is excellent! if you are looking for a realistic military shooter, you got it. but becareful and check your specs, cause its hell on the machine.",2
"arma:3 is a great experience with high quality graphics and realism. it even manages to run more efficiently then its predecesor, arma:2.",1
"i would of recomended this game but as i was globaly blocked from the servers i will not recomend it simply for installing it on both of my hard drives ! = global ban wtf is that all about",1
"great game but isnt as expansive as arma 2. amazing graphics though",2
"after almost 500 hours of playing arma 3, i still love it. yes, it does have points, where you most likely will say something along the line oh arma, why did you do this? but on a global perspective, the game is amazing and with its mods, maps, etc. it will give you a lot of opporturnities to play with.",8
"its a game that opens a gateway to mods that are better than the game.",1
"one of the biggest scams in steam game store. deserves its metascore of 74. if you liked arma 2 then just think of all the things that were good about that game (lots of real world guns, vehicles, etc). now think about all of those things taken away. now double the price. enjoy arma 3, with a bad netcode and crappy user generated content. at least people who bought it when it was still unfinished only put a 34.99 usd deposit, but well, game is not finished, now it is 59.99 usd with a bunch of gimmick dlc. arma 2: combined operations, the previous title in the series, has over 10 times the content for around 40% of this games price.",1
"you can pretend to be dead 10/10 it really works.....",1
"waste of money, game is pointless if you want to play the actual game (no mods)...",1
"this is one of the better games i have played from graphics to gameplay. it has multiple new weapons and vehicles, ai will actually be somewhat fair and not use their wallhacks, and pvp is suprisingly good. the only minor flaw about the game is that the ai still have very bad pathing in some areas and that they sometimes automatically know where you are. while mods can fix alot of what bohemia didnt, its still a very good game overall. definately recommended if you dont already have it.",3
"obviously, youll know what youre getting into if youve played, and had fun playing arma ii. potenetial for some really fun mutliplayer experiences, and a whole bunch of missions on the workshop to play on your own. huge map and great game mechanics.",6
"i have to say, this game blew me away the first i tried it. heres what i think of the game: pros: -realistic, if you get shot twice your dead, no regenerative health. -editor allowing you to create your own missions. -hard combat makes you think on how to complete said missions. -you dont always have to be the commander, or even fight. -multiplayer gameplay can be intense and make you think even more than against the ai. -makes you work with your team to actually get stuff done. -actual terminal ballistics. -booming mod community. cons: -hard to learn controls (if new to series) -some minor bugs (this will go away hopefully after beta, so im not taking a point away for it) i cant think of any more. so, overall, i give this game a 10/10. edit: just thought of 1 problem that affects a lot of people: optimization issues. new score: 8.5/10.",1
"this game is amazing. i played the second one as well and i can see that the third builds and improves on it ten fold. the looks, the motion, the weapons, environments, physics, and most of all the audio. i feel surrounded in the world as if i am part of it myself. i greatly approve this game with all its differences fromt its predecessors. anyone looking for a great simulator should pick up arma 3. bohemia interactive has amazed me yet again and i am so glad that they have.",3
"a grate milatery simulator i defantly recormend this game. (could try and put mods on steam like dayz on arma 2)",1
"best game ever on lags a blt but look up vlds pn how to get rld of lag",1
"this is the best war simulator you can get,most of the players online take it very seriously and you can co-operate a lot with other players.the campaigin is pretty hard ,but killing an enemy feels very satisfieing.bohemia really keeps eveloping the game to make it more awesome.",1
"just finished the main campaign, it was pretty fun and challenging.",4
"this game is amazing, the sounds just feel so real, the graphics are amazing and the fact that there are so many mods that can enhance the game even more is fantastic",2
"fun and realistic combat simulator. strong lurning curve but when you start to learn it, you can have alot of fun. i strongly recommend to people who like realistic games.",1
"this game is great and very realistic, but you definitely need to play this with friends and it has a definite learning curve.",2
"great game so many different game mods and is a great role-play game definatly worth the price. i highly advise buying this game!!",1
"arma three fits into the modern fps category very poorly, its not a bad game its just not cod, a better category would be tfps, tactical first person shooter, cause thats what it is, its also a very fun and challenging game.",5
"if you enjoy playing battlefield and are looking for a good military game then this is for you. the only limitation is what you can imagine, as most things have been made by the amaxing modding community, and if you dont want to make your own missions then either play the best arma campaign ever! or just download one from the community.",3
"one of the best game ive played in the past couple of months",1
"dont know why i bought this. not my kind of game. if you are unsure whether or not to buy this just because your friends say so, dont do it.",1
"arma 3 is a great game. whilst there are still some bugs and glitches it is well worth the purchase. this is the only game where you spend an hour getting to the enemy only to have a 20 second gun battle, yet still enjoy it. this is nothing like battlefield or cod. unlike those games, every single kill that you make gives you great satisfaction and, since it takes so long to get to the battle, you value your life much more than you do in battlefield or cod. this game does have quite a steep learning curve and you will need a full keyboard, but after a few hours, you will really begin to enjoy playing this game. also, arma 3 is not only a military sandbox, it is also the best go-kart simulator!",3
"i had a lot of fun playing it with my friends, looking forward for arma iv ;)",5
"#1 who the  is shooting me simulator. 10/10 would die trying to get canned food again. all honesty though, get this game. into mmos? get this game. rpgs? get this game. into shooters? get this game. into military simulators? get this ing game. the amount of diversity along with how smooth it runs for how beautiful it looks honestly makes this game worth the full price, so if its on sale make sure you get it because this is a game id say 99% of people should try. itll make your life so much better to get some buddies, hop on ts, and have litteral endless hours of fun and intense missions while testing the extent of your friendships. youll get so lost in it youll forget its a game half the time too, just a warning. not into the multiplayer scene? still get this ing game. the campaign... wow.",2
"arma 3 is great with friends and also when your board you can mhave fun with other people.",1
"arma 3 is the best millitary sim out there! it has awesome graphics which alot of people can run on a decent rate however the game can be a bit glitchy at times, but will hopefully be fixed soon 9/11 - can play as a terrorist applepicker",1
"this game is great, better optimized than arma 2, resulting in better frames, and all the mods for it make it a overall great game.",2
"this game is complete crap i go on not being banned on dayz arma 2 or arma 2 operation arrow head play the singleplayer for a bit join my friend and get banned gloably -_-",1
"what is love? baby dont hurt me, dont hurt me... no more!",3
"buy it! i tested it and its the best and most realistic fps military shooting game ive ever played!",1
"bohemia interactive never stop surprising me. when you think they reached the best anyone can do, you notice the beta or alpha in the name, that tells you that isnt even the best they can do. from arma ii and pretty much all the expansion packs, to arma iii. if you enjoy a realistic war simulator, or wasting times in the huge amount of mods you can find for the game (looks like skyrim), this is your game!",1
"this game continues to be one of my favorite games. if you are into survival/fps games this is well worth the try.",2
"a really great and realistic game but do not buy this game if you are not patient because you will have to wait alot of time for a enemy to shoot or to get a chopper, car etc. sometimes.",4
"simply put, if your not a fan of arma - your definitely not a cool kid!",4
"just another arma. same bugs (with a bunch of new ones), same gameplay, same problems, same game. absolutely worth buying for anyone who fell in love with tactical shooters (any of the ofp, arma series or bf2: project reality). and not recommended to anyone else.",1
"this game is a buggy piece of  the commuinity ranges between  talking s too ai stomping nerds who think they are commander big , with a few normal people inbetween. but its a great game that is hugely intensive and adrenaline filled. there is plenty to do, plenty of missions to play and mods to download. amazing graphics. once you become familiar with the mechanics and weapons etc. the game is absolutely amazing, just give it a try.",6
"best modern war simulation in my opinion, tons of gamemodes to choose from. you dont need a 2000$ pc to run it play with your friends, alone or with strangers youll always have a blast playing this game!",1
"a very very good dude shooter with things that only can happen in arma. 11/10 its kind of the bomb.",6
"a fantastic game! its still in his alpha but its completely fantastic. its worth those 25 bucks you pay for it.",4
"its just the best shooter ive ever played the graphics are awesome the game play is realistic as a fps could ever be it is the pub stomber of bf4 n cod what ever number or  name there up too",2
"it does have a better physics engine than arma: 2/ao, but this is somekind more a for fun, not to serious about war. it does have a lot of mods, but it does not seems that they are that good. like, seriously. a go-kart, in a war. does not seems to realistic, but i do like the zeus addon. i would give it 8/10, because it does not have the war feature i want. well, i would recommend this to clans and stuff. who wants their own server, and make some war!",1
"definitely a big improvement from arma 2 and the player made missions are when keep this game interesting",2
"wen plaein arma 4, remember to alwaes have ur gun in pokket, becorse enemies come tooo you, and shoot. u shoold shute back",3
"download enough mods and it starts to get good again.",10
"you will have to look far for a bether modern military shooter, if you can get over the bad interaction menu",1
"this game....ooooh this game...is amazing. its a first/third person realistic tactical shooter. if you are a person who plays call of duty and think you can run into a room witha sniper rifle and g37 th053 sw33t yy360quicks20p3s 1addersta1ls, then this game is really not for you. the campain is meh but the multiplayer is where the fun comes in, you have altis life a sort of rpg gamemode, patrol ops (my favorite) where you look for enemy encampments or chemicals and deal with them, teamdeathmatch, and tons of others. if you have played previous arma games you will know that the controls are a bit...odd...well, in arma 3 they are still kinda odd, but they are better. there is an entirely new mechanic in 3 called the stance system. basically, if you are standing you have four different poses that can help with almost each and every situation, same goes for the four crouching, and four prone. there is a decent range of weapons and atachments and no limit to clothing options. the one big, and noticable problem with arma...is its optimization...the game doesnt run well on some systems for seemingly no reason.",3
"if you want to get a game with bugs and so on. get this one. and arma 2 ofc",1
"completely unpolished game with an engine that runs poorly. expect crashes often and low fps on even the best rigs. down right terrible execution of a game/idea.",2
"amazing level of control and realism. great variety in gameplay when playing as different classes, with different weapons and vehicles. however, this game still has ye olde arma feel to it, meaning that occasionally youll have to wait a decade to join a server, you suddenly drop to 2 fps, or get lifted into the air. the amount of fps you get also is kind of terrible i must say, but hey, its a beta, and itll get some kind of polishing before its released, im sure about that.",1
"incredible game made by currently unpresidented developers, supporting probably the best online community ever. there isnt enough superlatives to describe the astoshining feat made by releasing this sandbox, at least not without sounding like a rant. frankly, take any favorite fps or military game. then add sandbox, quality, free dlcs and continuos improvements, scripting possibilties, all vehicles and weapons and maps readily avaiable from the first try, no need to rank up and no need to pay to win. i could go on much further, but the best source for factual information is of course [dslyecxi] his youtube channel:",1
"an awesome game, lots of mods and missions coming out every day and just think, this game is still being developed with new things every day. 5 stars!",10
"just kinda wish this game was as popular as it was back in early 2013.... ):",3
"i recommend this game it has a tactical aspect and good graphics.also good gameplay.",2
"is it good? hell yeah is it call of duty? hell no is it worth waisting an entire day in your life? hell yeah",1
"if there are three games i would live the rest of my life playing, this would probs be like number 2 ( number 1 of course being lol you dota scum :) ). get this, and if invest a bit of time and effort into it you will reap the rewards by the mrap loads. if you have tons of spare time (which all of us do but actually dont) i would thoroughly recommend this.",2
"184.2 hrs on record, and i still have problems with cas 10/10, would buy again.",3
"i was on top of a tower looking this airport terminal a mile away trying to snipe and this tank shows up from no where and blows me off the tower. this game is a blast!",6
"great game id pay $100 for this! its a must buy if you like real life type shooters.",5
"an excellent military simulator, has a large learning curve and requires patience inorder to to become skilled at. like most multiplayer games, arma 3 works alot better with friends becuase it allos for you to have more coordination, which is a very important factor in arma 3. its fairly system intensive , but has gone through alot of optimiztion patches, but you should still look into the system requirements before purchasing. i would highly reccomend it, especially if you have friends to play it with.",1
"love the game!. havent had as much fun playing a game as i have this one in a long time. the multiplayer mod servers are where you will have the most fun at!.",1
"if arma 4 does not come out, i will slit your mother.",2
"arma 3, another great hit after the arma 2 from bohemia interactive. great open-world game. graphics are quite good, with the gameplay and game mechanics. another feature for this game it is a huge target for modders. contains many fun modes, as well many co-op modes and multiplayer modes. one of the more popular is the battle royal mod. and also the campain is very interesting. on the other hand, the bad things are mostly the optimisation. its open-world and good graphics come at a heavy price. takes a good computer to have a full expirience.",3
"this game is absolutely ridiculous in the fact that there is so much more to this game than shooting and killing. i was sick and tired of the neverending onslaught that is call of duty and battlefield. while i see both of those as fun in a fast paced competitive environment, i wanted to find a shooter that had more of a roleplay aspect to it. arma 3 is exactly what i was looking for. you cant just run out in the open and expect 360 across the map headshots while hipfiring with an smg (one the maps are huge and two bullet drop). cover can keep you alive while in a deadly firefight and can keep you alive while your buddy tries to save you with his gunship he stole from an enemy base. also, there is a free movement camera by holding the alt key which changes the fixed camera in typical first person shooters. you can be running into a forest while looking to your right and you might notice an enemy patrol and can drop to cover before they notice you. and then theres the mods. there are so many different mods to make the game sound and look better and modded game modes that add even further role play in the game. i spent about 80 hours in one week addicted to one of those game modes and ended up missing a few days of school because i was sucked in. this game is best when playing with friends!!!",2
"best game eu..! or it would have been if only they implemented the weapons of modern war, instead of weapons of a war 50 years ahead.. i mean 6.5 caliber rifles? i use that for hunting moose.. but nothing to cry about when there is mods.. alot of mods including modern weapons like hk416, m4, scar and so on.. with every possible attachment u can think of.. i highly recomend this game with mods.. and for multiplayer experince i recomend ahoy world eu#3 modded server.. its just a blast.. :d",8
"a is for amazing, r is for im not really sure, m is for magnificent and a is for amazing again and 3 lastly 3 times the amazingness (true fact...trust me im a doctor)",2
"all around a good game, i would highly reccomend it to anyone who likes fps games.",1
"if you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. if you dont have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. if you dont have the game to play, get the money for it. if you dont have the money for it, get a job. if you dont have a job, rob the bank. if you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.",1
"great game love the continued development of it also!",1
"best simulator. anything you can think of in the millitary is in this game. so tactiful i almost fell off my dinosaur.",1
"this is definatley the best sandbox game out there, it has a great and creative community which have created amazing variants, such as wasteland or king of the hill. it is always action packed online and it runs smoothly on most pcs. there is so much to learn and do which is why i find it so addictive and would recommend it to anyone i know.",2
"if you do not have friends to play with this game is really boring! without friends it is also hard as hell because most people travel in packs. if you get this game get the breaking point mod and it will more enjoyable. i have liked playing it with friends though, it does make for some exciting times. if you are use to cod or battlefield this is not in your wheel house. you can go days without seeing anyone at all in the less filled servers. in the packed full servers you die really quickly. in the end it is probably not the best game and is not for everyone but i like it! 7/10",1
"game is good, only problem is desync drop frame in multiplayer kinda  but game is 9/10 recomend to everyone !",9
"this one extremely good and detailed game :) i liked it a lot",1
"i really enjoy all the different gamemodes and it also looks incredible. if you dont have a super computer though, dont buy. very unoptimized even with a good computer.",2
"closest thing you can get to dying in combat in iraq. comes free with a convoluted, hyper-detailed ui that i wouldnt change for anything.",1
"absolutltely no , big no, do not buy this game. this game is super worked, is for geeks that like details to te point that is no fun. to many keys, to hard to figure stuff and when you figure it you need to many keys to make it happen. i buy it, if i could have the chance again to not bui it i would not buy this game. grafics = awsome, hard worked, like i said a game for perfectionists, but a common folk will have no fun. not recomended",1
"my initial review said that arma 3 would be a great game by late 2014 when more mods and content were released. i am glad to say that this became true several months before i expected. between the incredible zeus game mode (an on-the-fly mission creator) and excellent mods like advanced gameplay mod, task force radio and alive this is one of the best co-op games available. you will need at least 4-5 people to really have fun in multiplayer, but theres really no other game that offers what arma does.",3
"a great mil-sim, although its poorly optimized, which is the biggest problem with the game. even with a gtx 780 and a 4770k, i can still only manage 25 fps in cities.",3
"arma 3: is a good game but has its bugs but over all and rilly good game",6
"if you like other armas and acutally have a pc that can run this, this is worth it if you catch it on a sale.",1
"an in depth game about; what else? military combat and war. i love arma 2 but this one expands on that and then some. 9/10",1
"realism enthusiasts regroup! this game is very immersive, to make you feel like you are in a war, a simulator. call of duty and battlefield players, feel free to join and man up!",3
"arma 3 is a game like no other that i have ever played. the fact that this game supports the community workshop will only increase the value and fun that you can have in this game. there are an amplitude of scenarios and missions that can be done and will have you pulling all nighters quite a bit. probably one of the most popular missions files that are available is alits life which is an rpg gamemode where you can either be a cop,rebel or normal civ. there are hundreds more missions to be played and this game has gone above and beyond my hopes and expectations of what this game would be. 20/10.",4
"one of the best games i have played related to the military,there is so much you can do. the team work that goes on here in arma is awesome.",1
"do something wrong? repeat after me, gunshot gunshot gunshot im dead! do everything right but standing an inch too far to the left? repear after me, gunshot gunshot gunshot im dead! do everything right while sitting in the right place? repeat after me, need ammo! do everything right while sitting in the right place and still have ammo? i dont know i never did that in the demo. but im going to get this game.",1
"buyer beware. this game is not worth $60. let me make that perfectly clear. its a year old (since release) and is still an extremely poorly optimized game. my only advice is to make sure you have a fast gpu (4+cores means nothing here), an ssd (it loads textures directly so an hdd will be a bottleneck), and read plenty of forums on how to best optimize it for your system. this game appears to be player driven moreso than developer. hence (in addition to lack of optimization) why i believe that this should never be worth $60. controls are clunky and awkward, and the simulation aspects leave something to be desired. if you still intend on picking this one up, make sure its on sale.",3
"very fun game, i will be looking forward to the full release",1
"far more polished than arma 2, this brings the series into a more modern timeline. has a slightly more tech feel to it, graphics and engine are cranked up a notch and feels a lot more fluid, but this is still arma, and it wont suit the casual gamer looking for a call of duty experience. this is still a simulator shooter at the core. despite optimisiations and a vast improvement over arma 2, you will still want (and need) a beast pc to do this game any kind of justice.",1
"used to not have a lot of guns but its constantly improving. its the most fun with friends but still a lot of fun alone. i would give it a 10/10 but because of the framerates and flying goats ill give it a solid 0/10",3
"this is an awesome game to play. the developer team is really caring about the community. the workshop and map editor helps you to do a lot of things that no other games can. the hardward requirement is pretty high and you will not get the best experience if you can only run on low or medium. plus, if you one of those people who play cod or battlefield a lot, you may need a few hours to l2p this game. arma 3 is seriously an simulation game, any gun can pretty much 2 shot or 1 shot you at any distance(and the ai is pretty good at aiming). stay in cover, move quick and you will enjoy this war on the island.",1
"this game is so chic!!!!! i recomment it. the graphic is amazing.",1
"gets better with every update! modding community is growing my the minute. must have for any tactical or military buff.",3
"a very hard but rewarding game. not like cod where you run and gun,you must play the game carefully and strategically. also this game is very realistic. this includes: bullet drop,fatigue,heavy weapon sway,penetration,and so much more. this game is truly the king of war simulators.",6
"mostly boring but the fun times are way better than the  times, although i reckon youre probably better wit arma 2",2
"hmm, this is difficult. been enjoying this but my biggest trouble is being a ; a blind  at that i can never see where the enmies are coming from and thusly i am shredded on even the lowest difficulty by the competency of the a.i if you are good at like spotting stuff then go for it! brilliant game but i just suck at it :d",1
"its simple there is just nothing quite as rewarding as arma 3 in the video game industry. i mean sure its learning curb is hard to get around but the benifits much outweigh the negatives. great game 9.5 /10 must buy",1
"the game is just great, sadly im waiting for some better hardware to play it xd i bought it when it was 25 on alpha. no regrets at all! love the series. from arma 2 i feel so much improvement in the game its amazing.",1
"yo g its just like cod but with vehicles so... best evaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. but on a serious note it takes a pretty decent pc to run and its really fun if you play with friends",1
"best game ever played! is the best real life shooter game you can have!",3
"great game hours of fun you can play lots of gamemodes and will meet lots of people",5
"one of the best games i have played. massive improvement on arma ii.",6
"i played this when the trial was out (i forget when) but even with the visualys turned all the way down this game was breath taking. i only played with the artiliry tank for a bit so i wont talk about that game itself but from what i did play in this and arma 2, this is a perfect fps.",1
"this game is as close as youll get to being in a real war. frustratingly realistic.",1
"if you are looking for a true milsim game, then grab it. its worth your money, only if it runs smooth!",1
"military sandboxing at its best. i come from the very first operation flashpoint, aka arma: cold war assault. and from that one, to arma, to arma ii and now iii, all it has been are major improvements. combat, movement, vehicles, graphics, its just keeps getting better and better. game still lacks content compared to arma ii, but its community and potention do promise. this aint cod, battlefield or payday 2. god rambo and die.",2
"i highly recomend this to any person that is smart and patient if ur use to cod and like it dont play this arma is way to realistic compard to any arcade game such as cod/bf3/bf4. one of my favorite games and alwats will be",1
"great game. i personally like the 2nd one better. too much gun sway in this one. much harder to effectively hit targets. vehicle control is tough to get used to. shocks act like shocks, so watch the bumps.",2
"very nice gameplay 10/10 would reccomend, very fluid controls and gameplay",1
"this game is a very good. the graphics are amazing and the game play is just what you would expect out of an arma game. and i love what they did as far as the epoch mod goes. they still have some bugs to work out but nothing you cant work with.",1
"i have almost 120 hours in this game and i still dont know half what it got to offer. it is simply the best game of 2013. if you is wondering wether or not to buy the game so buy it. the editor is the best way to experinece all the vehicles. play it as the game is ment to be played and you will enjoy it. if you are an battlefield or cod player dont buy this it is slow phased and you dont get you healt back after 5 seconds so buy it if you like slow phased and realistic games. this is the best way i can describe it. i have to go and play the game",5
"arma is such a strange game in some ways. theres always two sides, and not in the enemy and ally way ;) on one side it offers an almost unique experince (certainly in the previous series) of playing a game seriously, with as close to real as can be, perhaps too much so. but it does highten tension when youre all fighting together and if you make a mistake youre out. on the other hand the game itself sometimes feels clunky and the controls seem like they have purposly been made difficult. not that this is differnt from previous arma, it just continues to annoy me. any game that does not have e as use might as well not use wsad as directional keys. every action seems like hard work, almost like a battle, and while ive had fun with arma 3, it sometimes leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth, of time wasted. even with this, i struggle not to recommend it, its a good game, theres loads of game modes and if you can handle the control setup then youll certainly have some fun! plus its a step away from cod/battlefield, which sometimes can be a welcome change on its own.",1
"the game is damn good. but it has worst optimization ever. i probably need 2 titans to run arma on medium setings. do not recoment for weak pc like mine. (970 phenom, 560gtx.)",1
"so good really recommened it to everyone such a good game 20/10",3
"a pretty darn good game i should say, amazing campaign, and i love multiplayer, plus, the good thing is that you can shift from 3rd person view to 1st person view, what are you waiting for? go get it now!",1
"this is an amazing, war simulator that i would highly recomend to those who want to lead or follow from the front line in a group as large or as small as you want, take control and win. see you in game.",2
"obviously, youll know what youre getting into if youve played, and had fun playing arma ii. potenetial for some really fun mutliplayer experiences, and a whole bunch of missions on the workshop to play on your own. huge map and great game mechanics.",6
"amazing game so far and its only an alpha! updated and improved on so many things from previous arma games. if you like miltarty simulators this game has you covered; infantry, boats, vehicles and aircraft. huge maps (20km) and you can pretty much go in to any building now! in short, pre-order this game :d",2
"this game is almost the perfect pc game (in my oppinion) however it would be great if the game ran a little bit better but apart from that you can mod the living  out of it and spend hundreds of hours playing the various life mods! 12/10 - me :d",3
"this is not your typical run and gun game. you must take your time to learn the ins and outs. i highly recommend it.",1
"jebus if you want to increase your arma experience or want to try any arma games? its ing great!!!",1
"fantastic game with a lot of mods. the best military simulator i have played, you should get it if you have the money. the arma 3 life mod actually reminds me of gta v but a lot of more role play in it. i recommend this game 10/10.",2
"*highly recommended* this is one of the best strategy action simulators i have played since arma ii. looks beautiful if you have top range pc. one downside is that it is highly intensive on your cpu and i cannot recommend this for low end computers/laptops. you never run out of things to do, due to the steam workshop and level editor where mahy people create great game types and areas for combat. i give a 9/10",1
"it doesnt work. you have enormous lag on pcs with quad-pcs. the engine uses only 1 core -_- so if you somehow still use a dual-core pc you can play this game. if you have a really new quad-core processor you can play this game too. that aside, the game feels like its unfinished and just a money grab. they didnt invest in a new engine that actually works, you have no story and it totally depends on mods which still doesnt make it any good. you are thrown on an island with a pistol and there are some vehicles on the island. thats pretty much arma 3 in a nutshell.",1
"awesome game, most of times. on your first time playing its frustrating but on the other hand, a good game. must get your hands on!",2
"i like the way that the squad actually isuue orders unlike any other war games i have played",1
"the base game i would give 80/100.....with all the great mods people put together for it i would give it a 90/100. this is due to the fact some of the mods are still.....meh....to say the least. great game overall and highly suggested to realistic shooter enthusiasts.",6
"great game! a bit rough around the edges, but the potential is great!",1
"nice game, nice graphics ....acceptable gameplay with ai, good gameplay in pvp, could be lots of fun but there is only one reason i cannot recommend this game to someone ...if it happens you to be banned from battleye, you will get 0 (zero) support plus you will be banned from all games that uses battleye; arma2, day-z etc ...i bought the game in the first day it came out, supporter editon 70euros ...just that i did not find the same support i was hopping to get if i have a problem ...i still love the game but no, no one has ever replied to me a damn thing to all my mails sent appart from the automated one ...so no ...do not buy this game! at least till battleye goes out of the picture ...good luck!",2
"a brilliant, yet realistic military game. as expected from the arma series!",6
"if you like mods and love simulations then this game is worth it. theres many things that you can do within this sexy game, things that involve (tactical bacon)! just make sure to have friends or to be with a simulation mislim when playing.",5
"theres not much to say about arma, so many crazy stories come out of it. once me and two other friends were scouting around in some woods near some buildings, we were loaded up with weapons and some good backpacks. we spot a building we wanted to check for loot, except theres already about 3 or 4 guys in there from where we could see in the hills. so my friends decide its not a good idea to go down there, i had a grenade on me, i took off my backpack and left my sniper in one place (so my friends could take it for me if i died), took a grenade and a pistol. i launched the grenade high into the air where it exploded confusing the enemy, i went rambo into the building with a pistol and took all the guys out. so yeah.....10/10. get this game!",2
"such a good game everything about it is great you should definetly pick it up",4
"the best in mil-sim-harcore-sandbox-ing-around-with-shooty-guns-and-tanks-games around.",3
"one of the best games out if you ask me. if you love military shooter games and love to actually play as team and not just play some type bf or call of duty where you just run around shoot  you will enjoy this game. campiagn is a decent lenght(if you play on the hardest settings it will take you weeks lol) but the mp is where the game shines. i personallly play on co-op servers that run invade and annex or patrol ops and its almost like playing a real war(i highly recommend the 7thcavalry co-op servers). you do get the mp servers that run stupid  like wasteland(dayz rip off but worse) or atlis life( sims ripoff) but thats not what this game is about. do you love the thrill of hearing the bullets fly past your head or want to pilot a transport helio or attack helio giving the ground forces some cover and take out the armor or maybe you want to jump in a tank to lighten up the enemies forces or a artillery vehicle and use the viop to have the forces closer to the fight mark or even use there laser guided scope to spot targets and light them up. this game has finally fillled the hole in my heart for a real war shooter that i have been begging and praying for the last 20 years. this is the closeest game you will get to the real thing! i highly recommend getting this game.",2
"dissapointing amount of vanilla content to be honest, and with the dlc coming it sucks even more, but a worthy upgrade from arma 2 or an entry into arma if you have the #cashmoney.",2
"played altis life rpg for eight hours straight. made my first million. bought a chopper, and fully geared myself up. died in a fiery crash when the cops told me i couldnt land in a meth lab. lost all my money and had to start from square one. 10/10 ign",2
"i got in an blackfoot, found a small town full of cars. decided to launch super heli attack on city. i launched a missile at a zamak transport, it blew up and the destroyed truck flew up, hit the heli and it blew up also. 11/10 would attack again",1
"flight suposedly has hotas and rudder pedle support but you need to asign everything yourself and then the controll is eather jumpy or intermitently unresponsive. rudderpedles are usles 1/2 the time game thies to map stuff to trackir. ground many intreactive items spontaniously become non interactive. entering a veicle before being told to will caus mission failure. if your wallet is 60 dollars to heavy this is the game for you.",1
"excellent simulator for those who prefer their gaming sessions to be immersive and deliberate. it doesnt run very well and is far from perfect, but theres no one else on the market who does what arma does, simply because its very hard to.",10
"worth every penny, but theres still alot of improvement to be done like fixing the eject from moving vechile and stuff like that there just quite alot of little stupid bugs like that. but would recommend.",2
"i drove a jeep for 10mins to get to where the fight was. immediately after getting out of the jeep i died without even being able to fire a single shot. let alone spot the one that was shooting at me.",1
"the game its self is pretty , its altis life that makes this game.",1
"meh...dont get exited for this game its kinda bad!",1
"i killed someone on a go kart with a lightning bolt, then i killed another guy by putting several planes on him that glitched and blew up. buy this",1
"best game for milsim ever. if you dont own it, youre a noob.",7
"this is hands down the best milsim out there. the vast array of everything you can do is just out of this world. whether you want to go via land, air or sea (or all three) youll be in good hands here. make no mistake this isnt call of duty but much, much more.",9
"i went online, ended up in a go-kart with a hmg on top, and then getting a nuke and exploding everywhere from hitting a small rock with a gokart. 10/10 gotay",6
"in my opinion, much better than any of the previous arma games. first and foremost where do i start? the animations, the graphics and the physics are all improved perfectly and it just feels like you are at war! the optimization gives you much more freedom to tweak graphical settings. the co-op just has to be the best feature, knowing that everyone depends on you and you depend on everyone as a team.",1
"if you like arma ii youll like arma iii. if you havent tried arma ii you should definitely get that before you get this, to make sure you like the franchise as it is definitely a unique shooter. however, be warned as the game can be highly graphically demanding on the higher settings, and is comparable to arma ii on the lower settings (which is a little underwelming). all in all its a good game, and definitely one you should get in the beta due to its reduced price.",2
"great game, by far the most realistic looking army game out there !!",1
"good game, but needs alot more addons. arma 2 did it better",4
"one of the best combat/military simulators ive played yet. the intensity and pace is unlike nothing ive experienced in a fps/shooter before. if you are looking for a game thats slower and diverse than cod or battlefield, i highly reccomend this game.",2
"unrefined and jerky -- describes every aspect of this game. even with the settings turned down the animations are horrible and the guns are garbage - i cant even hit a window on the side of a building. bohemia needs to take some pointers from other shooters, refine the animations, fix the guns so they actually can shoot someone, and fix the jerky animations and lag so that whopever you shoot at, is not ghosting and jerking around like someone having a seaizure. i wouldnt even call this and alpha build and this game has been out for years -- no excuses at this point. i want my money back, this game is garbage.",1
"there is so much content to enjoy in arma 3-from cooperative missions to battle royale to wasteland. i guarantee youll be spending hours playing through it all. the experience becomes even better if you have friends to play with. even though the single player isnt very enjoyable, its a huge leap from that of arma 2. if you can catch arma 3 on sale, i definitely recommend you buy it.",2
"arma 3 does not have time to teach you how to play it. it does not have time to help you find someone to play with. it lacks the common decency to provide a story, of any kind, at release. bohemia interactives sandbox military simulation series began life in 2001 as operation flashpoint: cold war crisis before the developer retconned its own title, renaming the series arma. updating the game for modern pc players was a tall order, and after four long years of development arma 3 still isnt done. bohemia interactive made the decision to release it anyway. arma 3 may be the most challenging, and the most rewarding, online shooter i have ever played. but its missing key components  most damning of all a single-player campaign. as a result, it feels more like a huge demo than a finished product.",2
"great game, still new to it, and enjoy it so far. has bugs in it like all the other arma games out there.",2
"the only downside is how i can shoot friendly players in the back, or scare them by firing a high powered sniper rifle near them. extremely fun if you have a sense of humor.",1
"i absolutly love this game though i have a bad pc and this game is very demanding (my pc runs at 10-30 fps with low settings) it is still very fun",2
"its only in alpha and it still walks, flys, drives and dives all over all the tunnel shooters! a real improvement over arma 2 which i loved for all its faults. get it, try it now!",5
"arma to others but it is not a game for everyone and even inside the game there will be aspects of the game you like such as [military reinactments] and dislike such as [ battleroyal call of duty deathmatch] so everyone will want to play the game differently, but remember its game where no one has to tell you how to play it. overall 7/10 the game has problems in its polish but when you look past it you get a gaming experience like no other. note: this review has alot of spelling mistakes and missing subjects as i came up with this in 30 mins, future reviews will be written on proper writting software and also days in advance. i hope this review has helped you! note2: 743 characters too long!!!??? sorry i couldnt provide enough info but steam has a character limit so in the immortal words of awsome people i say test review, please ignore.",9
"i cant say much about the games single player experience, since i havent really done a whole lot with that. what i can say is that in large scale co-op missions, you really see this game at its full potential. this is easily one of the best co-op experiences ive ever had, and ive been gaming since i was 3 years old.",4
"get it, why are you even reading this. never before have i found a game i never get bored of- buy it now.",1
"i just started playing and im hooked.this is by far one of the best simulators ive ever played . i am recommending this game if you are into shooters. the realism of arma 3 is amazing. this is no call of duty or battlefield.",2
"best war game for me batter then bf3 and cod but its differnt of you like to comend unit and play maiisons like really life this game is for you sorry for my bad english",1
"definetely a great game! great simulator and also a it has some great mods. such as altis life and wasteland. i truley recommend this game to most players. i have some problems with it with my graphics card which needs some programs to fix but overall, amazing game. 9/10",1
"best game ever but single player sucks. play altis life or other stuff. buy it",1
"sale ends as soon the day before i get paid. zero out of ten.",1
"highly recommended for those wanting realism this would be as close as can get.",1
"better than battlefield. better than call of duty.",2
"a fun game, well can be fun, if played with the right people on the right servers on the right game mode... have fun!!",2
"great game! always worth the money arma is. the mods, the life, graphics, everything is great.",1
"this game looks to be good but if you want to play multiplayer and have a decent rig do not expect frame rates any where near 30 fps. no matter what setting you use it will not change and it will ran at low fps no matter what. if you have an older rig it will run better and be playerable. arma3 bis need to fix this problem its very disappointing that a recent game has these sorts of issues which have not been fixed from arma2. basically this game in multiplayer is unplayerable and a waste of money. i do not play single player and am not interested in it. bis need to fix it or refund all the suckers that brought it.",2
"i really dont give a  about this game until ace and acre is finished for this 0/10",3
"this game is probably if not the best modern (well almost modern) first/third realistic warfare simulator you can get out there... it may not have content worth $60, but the modding community on this game keep it going and keep adding new content to the game.. if you want a version of this game (with worse graphics,animations, and ai) but has loads of more content play arma 2 combined ops its cheaper... but i recomend this game do to its shear scale and the improved engine... in all both games i recommend but this one stands out... if anything buy this game on sale.",1
"a very good and realistic game, not for players who just like to shoot alot and kill the most people, this is for people who think strategic and have te patience to wait if necesairy. keep up th good work bohemia!!!",4
"its really good i love it the community is great :d",2
"great tactical shooter :) love the graphics, love the campaign, love the user created content! :) totaly worth the buck!",2
"it sucks it has the worst campain, it crashes all the time, the phyics suck, it has the worst a.i., and also if your playing on sever that does saves your progress then when you crash which happens all the damn time you have to ing start over",3
"10/10, ive only had this game for a few days now and i have accoplished so much. reason being is because there is so much to do! countless hours of fun.",1
"i recommend this game to all modern day shooters and arma lovers.",1
"welcome to the best military simulator of all time, how??? i here you ask. because unlike cod and bf4 you dont sponge a bullet to the face!!!!!!!",2
"excellent graphics and fantastic team play. if you want a game that is realistic and fast paced then this is the one for you. there are also chances to go solo in several multiplayer servers if thats your style!",5
"if you like open word shooters this game is epic! best to get with friends",1
"glitchy. its been out for a long time and i finally got it but im not into it at all. love flying helicopters but maybe 20 minutes or so in, the flight stick is suddenly unrecognized and i have to restart. its infuriating. added to a whole other mess of glitches and lackluster multiplayer (for me anyway) and frustrating single player. ill rate it a meh. ill be hated for it, but thats okay.",1
"great game : nice graphic open world fun playing with friends :d p.s i wish there are armory mode like arma 2 also hope there will be more map coming soon :d",1
"ai bugged out and wouldnt let me carry on with the campaign. 0/10 would play.",3
"game is all well and good. but i really hate the fact that they put the game this far in the future! the weapons are absolute crap! im shocked that they didnt just say to hell with it and give you ing lazer guns. i love the addition of scuba options and implementing body armor and customizing your own outfit and the campaign is interesting plus voice acting is much better than arma 2. id give this a 6 out of 10 because i am not happy that i am gonna have to download a  load of mods to play the game with equipment and vehicles that should of been implemented in the first place.",1
"its not a good game for newbies. no, its not... i use to sit at a place and watch the sunset. i have no idea how to actually shoot, drive and complete missions. its like my personal sunset simulator. and its damn beautiful. 10/10",10
"ultimate game for lovers of war and realism, excellent physics, and optimum gameplay...though it seems to me it is incomplete!!!",1
"this game wont let me play and just now when i tried playing it says i dont have it.... steam really!!!!!!",1
"the graphics are great, and there is a lot of stuff in the game from mortars to drones, helicopters and jets, tanks, civillian and millitary transport vehicles etc. it requires a great deal of skill to pilot/use some of these. the multiplayer is really good, and you can play altis life rpg, wasteland, co-op, king of the hill and more. 85% of community is great and much more mature compared to other fps games. the only thing i dont like very much is infantry movement, not sure why though, feels different. overall its a great experience, i recommend it.",4
"ground combat. air combat. underwater combat. vehicular combat. this game has a lot of combats! its good but the armor system must die!",7
"first off, this game is amazing. it has something to suit everyone, even though it is a military simulator. this is because of a dedicated community of modders. so if you dont want to be a soldier, get on an altis life server and fish or something. if you want the fight a gladitorial battle to the death, try battle royale. if youre into zombies there breaking point or overpoch. if you want a strict pvp mode that plays similaryly to bp or overpoch, get wasteland. there is so much that this game has to offer that i couldnt begin to list it all. this game like every other is not without flaws, however unlike many games, the dedicated community of modder also takes care of that with their own patches and fixes. seems like bohemia interactive did everything right with arma 3, and the opposite with dayz standalone.",3
"im going to be completely honest, i bought this game almost exculsively to play the battle royale game mod. as such, i have played very little of the actual campaign of vinilla experience. i can say though that if you like or enjoyed arma style games, you will appreciate the leve of detail and dedication to realism this series provides. the controls are responsive, and the guns handle amazingly. every time i died, it was 99% my fault and the other the lag i blame and curse over the microphone as i mourn my body. if you apprciate more realism to your games then straight up, over the top action, i would recomend giving this series a try. i did not mind spending the money and i bought this before the summer sale. i would highly recomend looking at the modding scene as well which is normally very active with arma series titles (look at the dayz mod)",1
"i highly recommend this game. very realistic, very hard. what i like most about this game is the combat is not over in 5 seconds like most action game eg call of duty. also with all the wide range of guns and very unique future vehicle makes this game incredibly fun.",8
"an absolute great military sim! the commmunity mods are wondeful and the games editor/campaign is bugless and very enjoyable. overall, this games new mechanics and engine make it a must buy for an avid military gamer!",6
"this game is not realistic at all really. recoil is garbage, the weapon sway is way to much, the damage you do to enemies is way to low, it shouldnt take more than 1 shot to the head to kill someone but in this game it does at times, when you fire a weapon fire doesnt come out of the barrel like how it does in this game, also 90 percent of everything in this game is fake and the rest are prototypes/in use. the only things that i can think of in this game that are real are the 556 weapons which do barley any damage so you dont every use them anyways... this game would be better if it wasnt called arma 3, because it ruined the arma name...",4
"this game has great bullet ballistics , best i have ever seen in any consumer pc game... only thing. this game should have linux support....",1
"slowly becoming addicted, the mods make this game what it is. although it deserves a lot of praise as vanilla arma 3",2
"this game is great! even though it currently has some interface issues, the gameplay is awesome, the mods and different gamemods keep you playing for hours on end, and the graphics look almost real as you see each individual piece of grass sway in the wind... if you like war simulation games then im sure you will probably get your moneys worth out of this game.",1
"in my experence with the game i have found that it is even more cpu intensive than arma2. unless you have a good cpu i would not recomend getting the game i have a fx 8350 and i only get 30 fps. not to mention arma 2 has abour all the same stuff. overall all a 8/10 game",1
"buy it and start with the battle royale mod (which is excellent for both solo and coop play) if you like super tactical shooters with roaming like far cry/crysis games. the map is 270 km2 and super varied so the encounters are always different. ive played 110+ hours and i still havent seen everything on the map. i experience immersion in this game like nothing else i have played for a long time. there is a lot of potential in the mods. the value is good because its future proof due to mods and updates. you can really stress out your high-end rigs with this game, and the optimization isnt terrible - it runs better than arma 2 and dayz. i tried the game with a 7 year old rig and it was playable. the game is pretty much reliant on mods so you should be prepared to install some, they are easy to install though the game is definitely not bug-free at this time, and the physics are questionable. youll get stuck inside rocks and walls, shoot invisible obstructions, and die some unfair deaths. the controls are also really technical, so it is best for hardcore and patient players, maybe as an evolution from battlefield-like games",8
"arma 3 is a very fun game. on my other account i have put about 2000 hrs into arma 2. i just love the francise! very good driving mechanics also!",4
"dont walk across altis when playing this game...youll have 30 hours by the time you hit the other side...",3
"10/10 loving altis life,wasteland,battle royale this is a great game defos would buy an arma 4",3
"one of the best tactical shooters ive played since arma ii. :)",4
"highly suggest getting this game. i found it highly addictive, and love making new missions. also if you dont have a decent pc dont bother, arma 3 is best at its full quality and i couldnt stand playing it when my old computer couldnt handle it.",3
"i highly reccommend this game! amazingly realistic and accurate, but tedious to play at times.",5
"huge map awesome graphics only in arma moments not recommended for those that want a fast paced shooter or dont have a reasonable pc sweet game thumbs up :)",4
"arma 3, iv spent many an hour on you and i still dont know how you work... be careful, wooden fences may blow up your tank xd awesome game",2
"graphics 8/10 opitimized 4/10 gameplay 6/10 multiplayer campaign 7/10 mods 10/10 overall 6.5/10 now down to the deatils. the games graphics amazing looking. the opitmization. yeah thats not existing. its like dayz standalone in its early beta. so yeah... mods for it great. altis life, takistan life, city life, surfing, arma 3 life mod. really great game. plus overpoch. freaking amazing. now to the campaign... again... almost not existing. the campaign is about as boring as a math class would be on a friday afternoon. so would i recoomend tehe game? well if you only want to play the mulitiplayer and the mods then i definitly would recoomend it. plus if you rae into roleplaying games the mods for this game will be perfect for you. there very well designed and have great guis unlike somethign like gmod darkrp. now if you want a war simulator... no not the game for you... go back to arma",5
"i played altis life only, and had a couple of enjoyable hours with a few friends there. dont know about the military simulation, but i have to express a clear reccomendation based on altis life alone, so the rest doesnt even have to be good :)",1
"i bought this game expecting to have hours of fun... but the game devs thought differently. it has been a week since i got the game and i have not been able to play it because every time i launch it, i get error 81 and it wont launch. this has been happening to alot of people and there is no fix. the game devs are either lazy or just dont care because the problen should be fixed by now. im not reccomending this game untill the problem is fixed.",1
"well this is a good game but i got the game to play a mod called atlis life but i guess they added it into the game and i dont know how to play it. :(",1
"not worth the 60 bucks but i find its graphics to be a very nice upgrade to arma 2",3
"not a very good game, impossible to find a legitimate game online.",1
"the game was absolutely beautiful to look at, graphics were on target 100% but if your a first time arma player the user friendly version is not there. leaves you completely disoreinted almost immediately. camera views while inside the vehicle leave you going for the number pads 0 key a lot. once outside the vehicle your cameras axis is only in the up down view there is no 360 view here boys/ girls. it does however have the genuine military simulation feel. for the amount of times it use the f-bomb youd think you were on a military boat. hence the term make a sailor blush. all in all id give it a 6 out 10.",1
"its one of the most accurate action/mil-sim game ive ever played. there is nothing else like this out there. 10/10",2
"although i only played the free weekend my experience with the game (king of the hill and altis life) was pretty amazing. my only problem with it however is the battleroyale servers because they are always locked during a match which can take a longf time so to improve this i would make an area so players can wait for the match to finish. i was kind of sad about this because that was one of my main reasons to play arma 3 but i never had the chance. thanks to gassy mexican for showing the game on youtube (and making me play it)",1
"this game is sweet, i love playing it and have invested way to much time in it :p. oh well, my recommendations... step up your gamer level with arma 3!",6
"this is as real as it gets for war games. if your looking for a good realistic game this is for you 10/10.",1
"the realisim in this game is intense! this always has my heart racing and puts you right there in on the action. love it great job.",2
"there aint any horses in this motha a.  you and this game",1
"have you ever wanted a game that makes you feel like youre a badass army dude? if so, dont buy this game! no, instead this game has an even better experience. it requires skill and teamwork in order to win. the map is huge too. not only that but the modding capability is very expanded. overall i would easily play this game instead of call of duty or battlefield any day of the week.",1
"awesome game. different playstyle. find a good group to play with and it becomes stellar.",1
"it calls itself a realistic simulator game and it is. -great graphics -good campaign missions (scenarios or showcases) -full sandbox mode -multiplayer -wonds affect the player one bad thing is you will never stop looking at the control menu for the first few hours until you figure out what keys you will be using.",1
"pls update for more fps :c my pc is good i play 30 fps ( medium) but more is better :c",1
"this game is great combines between fps and simulation, in a realistic environments it got everything a game needs, starting with the amazing graphics, sounds, ambient effects, everything gameplay is great, & steam workshop got some of the best mods youll ever imagine, great game, a must have.",5
"downright the best military simulation game ever.....its a must play game highly recommend",4
"really fun to play with friends, 10/10 from me on how realistic the shooting is.",2
"software is buggy, ill get stuck between water and land and have to restart the level. also, i can do 2 direct head shots and nothing happens but, the character can take a single hit anywhere and die; this is on novice. if i take a differnt path, the level gets hung, and nothing will progress unless the level....again has to be restarted. my team members will have super human powers and they take off leaving me in the dust, while my character never recovers from exhaustion. i understand they try to make this a realistic as possible to being a foot soldier but, i spend most of the time walking from one end of the map and back. i wish they did more r&d before releasing this and spent more on combat; i wish i could have my $ back.",1
"i like this game they should add the hovering jet back from arma 2.....this game is smexy",3
"this game is worth the $60 many different modes ranging from role-playing, wasteland, king of the hill, breaking point, tatical realism, and many others. this game is also more fun with friends 10/10",3
"seems like a good game only did the training part but seemed good",1
"good single player, great coop multiplayer...when it works. the servers are rather sketchy, they dont run very well and there are hackers waiting to ruin your experience. just this past week one of the servers was hacked 3 times! but, it is fun and when you get on a server that is good it is worth all the trouble. but, the most annoying thing to me is this has only been out for a year or so and the coop servers are already kinda dead and this is dissapointing. most people only play altis life, the role playing section of the game, which id rather just play gta online. if this is on sale, buy it. wouldnt shell out the full $60 on it though. if you love tactical games such as ghost recon and rainbow six, this is your game. all in all 8/10.",2
"4 reasons to buy arma iii. 1. i looked at the horizon and saw a hemmt going to space, i had to double-check if i wasnt playing any space related games. 2. a guy hitted the brakes and got thrown out of his car. 3. a medic was driving on the mainroad, i heard his sirenes and suddenly boom and an offroad flew through the sky. 4. freaking people using go-karts as rocket proppelant. 100/10 altis space program",4
"very realistic game, its funny if you play with your friend but its also cool alone",1
"best shooter on the market. skill, tatics and stealth all required. not just run and gun like every other shooter these days. also has a great modding community dedicated to producing good quality maps, weapons, mods, etc.....",1
"best like real gameplay! when you hear bullets pass over---- puts you in a place where you never think you be in.",10
"this a very good game great graphics gamelay and everything the only bad thing is the price.",1
"i think this might be the most realistic war game i have ever played :)",4
"the previous title, arma 2 in my opinion, is in ways better than the third installment.",2
"i love this game mods are the best way to make this game one of the best",8
"as always the mod comunity makes arma iii far more fun than the guys at bohemia . altis life dayz breaking point wasteland to name a few mods worth looking at .",1
"if by chance you are fortunate to be right-handed, use default controls at all times, dont mind that even this comes with several impairing elements, dont mind tons of glitches and unstable content, dont mind wading through to find actual significant content yourself or want to put in dozens of hours of effort to make content in a steep and vague learning curve...then this game is the best a military simulation can do for now.",1
"game is really addicting and well maded only needs more work with ai. 9/10",1
"i highly recommend this game for any wanting to see the closest thing to real life combat without actually joining the army. not only does this simulate real military tactics but provides an excellent window of opportunity for clans to really feel like they are in the middle of a war! friends can get together and act like the special forces team that they all wanted when they were little kids! you can even have roleplaying games and custom games such as cops and robbers! this is by far my favorite military game of all time! sure it takes a while to learn about the dangers of not going prone when an enemy comes by or getting major fatigue in the middle of a firefight but it is a simulator and by far the best one for military standards. i do not recommend this game for the call of duty & battlefield lovers because there is just no simple respawn or run and gun it situation this is not built for deathmatches! it is built to be a simulator that simulates real time combat for the hardcore people! there are no killstreaks/cod type loadouts/simple respawn or scoreboard. if anyone gets mad because this game is just a simulator i only have one thing to say. this game is not for you!",2
"dont buy this game. its not finished. there is no story, there are bugs, ai is stupid,........ bohemia doesnt give a  about releases they promised. we are still waiting for the 2nd part of the campaign that should have been released - as promised - in december. now the tell us it will be february. its a sanbox and without community developers this game would worth 0.- i highly recomment to wait a few months.",8
"why is your ing game broken??!! i try to install and it just deletes itself..",1
"this is a really good game with amazing graphics. best to play with friends and to communicate.",2
"arma iii is a great game, entertainment and graphics wise. the workshop feature is pretty cool as well. being able to download player made missions, and derp around with vehicles and the wide variety of weaponry make the game fantastic. its not for everyone, not nearly as fast paced as cod, cs, and even bf. some of the stuff on the workshop are good enough to be games of their own. the scuba diving is awesome! 10/10",2
"very fun game. espically with all the mods like, epoch, altis life and arma 3 life. all very fun if you like role play. epoch is a zombie survival game if youve played arma 2 epoch its very simular.",1
"this is probaly one of the best games out there, you can really do whatever. mods, roleplay, missions, roaming, campaign anything really. it seriously worth buying!",1
"this game is all about tactics and fallowing orders great game if you can combine thoose 2 if not go play cod or bf where things are much more simple this game is a simulator.",1
"best milsim ever, but be in mind to put mods in to make the game even more realistic to sounds more guns etc. i highly recommend this game for players who like real sim-tactical shooters. with mp the game is even more fun. this game is also a fps-shooter. i recommend to buy this game when on sayle, because the price is way to high. greetings,",1
"probably the best game i have played so far in my life. futuristic feel to the game is a small minus. (story is set to 2035 i guess)",2
"one of the best games i have ever played. if you liked arma 2, youll love arma 3!!!",5
"a nice game, but not optimised for amd-multicore users. im a big arma fan, but its unplayable on my pc. (5-20 fps) amd fx-8120 black edition gtx780 8 gb ram probably the game uses one core most of the time. there are a lot of such called tweaks but they all have the placebo effect. please bohemia, fix it. when you have an decent intel processor, this game runs better. still thumbs up for the game.",2
"if you have friends, this is a great game to play with them. if you dont have any friends, this is a great game to play alone. if you dont have the game to play, get the money for it. if you dont have the money for it, get a job. if you dont have a job, rob the bank. if you get arrested robbing the bank, at least you tried.",1
"brilliant... simply brilliant. needs some premium hardware to play, but other than that, it is worth your money.",5
"although it can be unforgiving and difficult at times, this is still an excellent military simulation. thouroughly enjoying it.",2
"if you like cod or bf this is not the game for you... this is a simulater, its awesome and with some select mods its more awesomererer+12x2... the built in misson editor is a bonus too, countless user created content, just buy it... go on.",4
"if you like gmod/shooter games you will find arma3 very fun with many many different missions/vehicals/guns it is much more fun with friends",2
"this game was just too slow for me.. some servers are meh at best. the maps are so large and the server populations are so low, its a very slow experience. ive tried several of the game modes, which does tend to make for a different play experience, but for me, i like combat atleast every 3-5 mins in a game versus running/driving/flying across maps for 10 mins to get to the action.",1
"real simulator, veeery hard i wanted to refund... but its eally a great game",1
"awesome game to play if you into military sims, but you better have a beast of a machine to run it on :)",1
"0/10  microsoft vc redist worst communist software will not install plz halp much kill",1
"cleary the best military simulator on the market today. wasteland is out of this world. 10/10 42 hours i have played in the last week alone.",1
"if you havnt already played any arma titles youre missing out so why not start now?",3
"90/89 i only got this for the dew and doritios package.",1
"great game, i love the game, and i fell in love the game mode rpg, on projectnarnias rpg server, its nice and good staff",2
"fantasitc game ,no need to say more.hope for better feature.",2
"one of the best shooter games ive played....its worth the buy.",1
"my friends and i spent 5 minutes in a tank shooting at a bush on the road thinking it was a person. best game ever 15/10",1
"got arrested on my first day of gameplay for no reason in altis life. 10/10",1
"this game is really cool i like king of the hill eerything about this game. i just get",1
"a lot of fun in general and a whole bunch of awesome mods.",10
"the ultimate game for military co-op, its my hands down favorite game.",2
"fun game with many gamemodes and mods that are amazing, but you have to have a great computer and be willing to learn all of the controls.",1
"extremely realistic and fun milsim mmo. reccomend for anyone who likes, well, games!",5
"arma 3 is a great open world simulation military shooter. its not like your normal run and gun shooter. the game focus more on the realistic side where tactics and team work is key on being successful. arma 3 give you a large variety and options, kind of like battlefield 4. youre able to be just a random grunt or you can fly a helicopter (not as easy as other games) or drive a tank. bohemia interactive did a great job on the graphics of the game as well, it can be hard to find camouflaged players that are not moving unless you have thermal optics or what not. i recommend this game to more of the hardcore gamers who looks for a realistic game. i dont recommend it if your just trying to find a shooter to pop in and out like counter-strike.",7
"one of the most astonishingly open-ended games i have ever played. the sheer scope, diversity and flexibility of content packed in this game is completely and utterly mindblowing. this game and its predecessors stand and laugh at all those other games calling themselves realistic, and shows them how to get it done. twitch reflexes dont win here, player cunning and coordination does.",3
"graphics are very good and the open world is amazing. make sure you have a godly computer if you want to run 60 fps though!",1
"huge disappointment, lack of content, no jets, no campaign (later as free dlc - what a ...). imo arma2/oa still beat a3.",1
"optimized for nvidia cards. feels unfinished but none the less if you like simulation games and a fan of the arma series by bohemia interactive then i stongly recommend this game. its set a little bit in the future",3
"children play call of duty boys play battlefield men play arma",1
"singleplayer -it has its own unique features in every aspect of the game it has its own style. -the game is just simply perfect. -it has loads of fun playing in singleplayer. multiplayer -once youve step up on multiplayer, i think you couldnt go back on singleplayer, unless if you havent have an internet connection. -the different gamemodes of multiplayer is just simply fantastic! -the gameplay of different gamemodes is stunning! -tons of good words that i could say. **highly recommended** what are you waiting for? buy it, try it, and play it now!",1
"its a really good game, but the one problem is that all the dlcs (discounting one) need like a 10 for me, which is kinda annoying when you want to enjoy the game.",4
"epic game with lots of weapons, vehicles, drones, epic islands(alits-400 km^2 of hell)",2
"this is by far the worst campaign i have ever played. the only fun mission is the first one, the second one is absolutly horrible. you have to get to a camp in 10 mintues but there are 50 ai that are pro shots that will kill you instantly. oh yea i forgot to mention, there are ied/ landmines everywhere. the multiplayer is alright, i can only get in about maby 3 servers out of 200 update: i really like this game after playing it bunch. still the campaign sucks but the senarios are pretty cool. multiplayer can be fun if you get a good server. i like playing on patrol ops. anyways i give campaign 3/10, multiplayer, 8/10",1
"it is a brilliant game. sooo realistic. only downside is you need a good graphics card... a+++",1
"a good soldier is fast, accurate and effective in dealing with his weapons - all weapons in arma 3 have realistic ballistics and handling. adjust your weapon to compensate for the bullet drop, go into a squat or on the floor to reduce the recoil, and fire at short intervals in order to reduce scattering of ammunition. if you do not observe these points, your opponent has easier time to gain the upper hand. with 270 km , the island altis is the real star in arma 3 from large-scale cities over rolling hills to wind and solar farms - regardless of whether the layers flattened rolls with your tank in the south or cause an asymmetric war of the hills in the north, the landscape of altis offers extremely detailed locations with numerous combat options. one of the best military simulators at the time, along with the stunning new engine, and the variety of mods a good game. 79/100",1
"as all arma games they are hard to figure out the controls but bieng the next step after the most realistic game in the world its understandable.arma three has greatly improved its campaign after arma 2s rather terrible one arma #s is actually worth playing.when it comes to multiplayer in a arma game there is nothing like it ranging from altis life(role play) to conquoring the whole vast 270 sq kilometers of altis.i would definately recommend this game to anyone that has a computer that can handle it.nomatter if you have the recommended requirements or not as you can imagine this game puts a load on computers.",3
"do not buy this game. its a colossal waste of money. instead of paying bohemia interactive for their failing, they should pay you for all the pain and suffering while playing this game.",2
"the best game i have ever played, perfectly balanced, perfectly made. arma 3 has no competition.",2
"7/10 single player is fine. mods can make sp a fun experience. but once you try mp, thats a solid no unless you play wasteland or on a private server. the fps on any server running a custom game mode is terrible. it is higly unlikely you will get above 30 fps on a public server. i cant speak for private servers but if you want to play mp, play wasteland or find a group that has their own not-bad private server. only recommended because of sp",1
"this game is the most fun and realistic military sim i have ever played. much better than battlefield or call of duty claim to be. maps are huge and combat is large and extensive. i would highly recommend this game.",1
"before i played it for the free weekend i knew it would be good but it was much better than i expected.",2
"this is by far the worst campaign i have ever played. the only fun mission is the first one, the second one is absolutly horrible. you have to get to a camp in 10 mintues but there are 50 ai that are pro shots that will kill you instantly. oh yea i forgot to mention, there are ied/ landmines everywhere. the multiplayer is alright, i can only get in about maby 3 servers out of 200 update: i really like this game after playing it bunch. still the campaign sucks but the senarios are pretty cool. multiplayer can be fun if you get a good server. i like playing on patrol ops. anyways i give campaign 3/10, multiplayer, 8/10",1
"thought boot camp was hard...then i played the game. many shots. much bleeding. fun mods. been hunted,ran over and even shot for apples of all things lol.",1
"there is nothing, i mean nothing like arma. this is really and endless game. the mod community is robust and very active. everything, and anything is possible in arma iii. this is what pc gaming is all about! watch this video for a better example.",1
"love this game. love it how it is set and everything!",1
"there is a learning curve if you are looking to play it seriously, becoming good at this game requires dedication and time but there are usually casual servers to have easy fun on if you are looking to mess around",1
"this is the game for all of you wanting something more real out of your fps. not for casuals though not so compicated as arma 2.",1
"complete trash of a game. every single problem from arma 2 (which is a lot) is still there. do not buy this game. everything from the controls to the camera to the instructions is useless and made by monkeys. if you fly a heli the slightest turn of the mouse and your camera spins 180 degrees and you can see everything but what you want. waypoints are still in the dumbest colour ever so you can never see where you are going. such a shame as it looks amazing and has so much detail but you need to deal with so much frustration and just utterly poor game design. i wish you could get a refund cos this game is an outrage.",1
"i got banned for hacking in weapons to test weapons vehicles with my buddies whilst the game was in beta now i am still banned and i need to pay another 45 euro to play on another account",1
"i bought it a week ago and still cant play it ive tried everything even asked steam for help still nothig sucks when you buy a 60 dollar game and cant even play it this is the first and last game im going to buy from steam",1
"wasteland is great fun with friends and the game is very pretty, map could use some more development but other than that its an all round fun experience. i would not recomend this game to anyone with sub-standard hardware as this is no fun with anything less than 40 fps.",2
"this game is a must have if you like milsim. it is very realistic, and has a great community. wasteland is for those who enjoy killing everyone in sight even if they are wearing the same camo. deathmatch is meh. coop missions are some of the best game modes. if you are new to the series, check this out, the controls are a little strange at first, but you will grow to love them.",6
"great game! but the problem is that it is too expensive. make it cost less and peoples will have more fun playing it with there friends, because right now arma 3 is forgotten cuz of day z. this game is without doubt the greatest war-sim ever, but yet it is way too expensive.",1
"as the 3rd installment to the arma series the quality that this game brings to the table is unpresidented in any other arma game. with the rv4 it adds in directx 11 to bring stunning new visuals never seen before in the franchise. the clunky mechanics from arma 2 have been reworked and are now fluid as ever in arma 3. although the game was rough at launch with performance the series of patches have vastly improved performance and by far is the smoothest arma to date! multiplayer is better than ever with the new vehicles new guns! overall id recommend this product to anyone who likes realistic shooters!",4
"i dont even own this game, but really want it, 10/10 would write a review for a game i dont own again",1
"its a good game and with altis life the best game :d",1
"this game is very intertaining. you can have lots of fun by playing the campaign or online. i find the best thing to playis the mod breaking point. this is a dayz like game that has a lot less problems. you can pick a faction each time you die and respawn.",1
"i know this is still in development, however the game mechanics were not smooth enough to enjoy the gameplay.. 3/10",1
"a fantastic military sandbox with many addons & mods to experiment with. it has its fair share of cons and pros, the cons laying mostly with the multiplayer aspect of the game. if you intend to buy this game, i recommend upgrading your cpu as well as your gpu pc specs (if yours dont already meet recommended specs). while singleplayer is a graphical  and is fantastic to play on maxed out settings, multiplayer youll find it the complete opposite. multiplayer i found is managable only if you can deal with the fact that you may have to play on low graphical settings. as a cpu intensive game for multiplayer, youll have to deal with lower fps and graphical settings if you intend to play on bigger servers. on smaller servers, higher fps is attainable as well as higher graphics. if you can deal with this con that arma3 bears in its mutiplayer system, then your time & money will be well spent on this game. away from the cons and on to the pros, this game is the best military sandbox out there. with arma3s many details and functions you can find yourself commanding a squadron of jet-fighters or leading a squad to capture a control point. the scenarios are limitless with arma3s steam workshop integration. all in all id give this game a 9/10.",8
"this game is a tactical realism genre, you should only buy this game (59.99$ usd) if you like a tactical realism game. or if you are a arma 2 fan..there are not just millitary missions also there is atlis life rpg.wasteland (pve) pvp this game has an active community in the workshop uploading awesome missions used with the editor.they just recently added a 3d editor called zeus which will lets you strike lightning at people!.there are still glitches in the game but the devs are working hard to fix it.guess what no hackers!but the arma physics are ape .. and finnaly if you dont like the original game there is the moded version! dayz breaking point,has been released. new weapons,vechicles and maps for a new experience every time.arma 3 can get repetitive if you dont switch to another gamemode. the games graphics are beautiful :d a huge improvement compared to arma 2. ;d if you wanna check if youre pc can run this game google can i run arma 3?",6
"arma 3 is, by far, the best millitary simulator ive ever seen. only for those who like hardcore millitary simulators.",2
"arma 3 is not quite a first person shooter, it really is more of a war simulator overall. it is highly detailed and looks great visually but there can be a bit of a learning curve. the games strong point, in my opinion is the way it tries to do multiplayer, where you make missions and what not. i find this single feature what makes arma stand out the best. more shooters should have the level of control arma 3 gives players. there were a few cons to all of its pros though, so i will list my biggest as follows. 1. multiplayer servers (if not set up properly and efficiently) can make the game squat down and take a huge dump on your fps (frames per second) 2. i feel the multiplayer user interface could use some work. making the game more accessible to new players. 3. better single player. arma may be best for its multiplayer but i think overall more work could be done making the single player experience more enjoyable. all in all i think arma 3 does the shooter/ war simulation best, it may not be as popular as games like cod or battlefield but thats not a bad thing. imagine if it was that popular, then we would be dealing with those guys...",1
"the game barely runs, dont bother. gtx680, i7 2600k edit: there have been minor performance enhancements to make this game playable.",1
"realy nice game... a few bad hacks and buggs still out for it but over all very good game",10
"something between americas army and battlefield, this game gives me what i need regarding realism and graphic design. the performance on custom missions definitely needs improvement - sadly, nothing seems to be happening anymore. either way, i recommend!",4
"i want to get this game after playing the free weekend, but i will have to wait till any discount steam can offer me since i am low budget atm... i strongly recommend this game though, great fun",8
"ran over a hill. got shot by a tank. got called a noob. 10/10 would noob again",1
"this game has effectively ruined my life. i barley shower or even leave the house anymore. i no longer have friends in real life and my girlfriend left me because i play it too much. 11/10, would play again.",2
"downloaded and installed on free week-end. able to post review. 10/10",1
"when you play on stratis, your main enemy is rocks, and when you play on altis, your main enemy are fences. also, if you hit anything hard enough with a hatchback sport it blows up.",2
"exactly the same as arma ii but it looks a lot prettier. an improvement is that optimization is better... not on a server... which is where most of the game is played.",1
"a more realistic battlefield/cod when you play modes like wasteland or king of the hill; can also be fun if you play the dayz mod for free; battle royal, do i need to say more? get dropped on an island with 30 other people, find a weapon and survival of the fittest!; if youre the roleplaying person, who likes to deal drugs, have s (women, who sell their bodies to greasy guys) or just be a corrupt cop, then altis life is just the right thing for you! so in general, this game offers are great variety of mods, its very own realism and its not full of garbage kiddies, who flame and pretend to have made love with your mother (like the cod-fanboys, lel) 10/10 would buy again",4
"a very good simulation and game. so many things to! good buy if u like these sort of games!",3
"wish the items in the game had their authentic names instead of off brand nicknames. great game other than that.",2
"personally love the arma series, 3 started off good but has since got unplayable for me after each update. gone from 60fps to sometimes under 30 regardless of server or game type. nothing has changed at my end, so given up for now. edit: ok, on my new pc this gaming is truely awesome. just one of those games that needs a nearly insane amount of hardware to run best",2
"great game. great successor of the previous one. a must have for every military enthusiast!",2
"this was my first military simulator and i loved it. pros -graphics -quality of the simulation -variety of game modes cons -takes long to get used to it -a bit too addictive :d i would reccomend arma 3 to anyone but if you are feeling not so sure about getting this game get it in the steam sales like i did for 17 pounds :)",5
"this game is a lot of fun but their anti hack protection battle eye is dumb as !!!! i got a battle eye blobal ban (banned from all sevrers) for having my cheat engine running on another ing game",2
"i was knocked out by a 6 y/o with a vector 45. smg while he was attempting grand theft auto. 10/10",3
"great game, needs a good computer to run it but its well worth it.",7
"arma 3 is the most replayable game ever. its so easy to create your own content, and if you join a clan or just play with some friends you will always have something to do. yes, arma has its bugs; and yes they can be annoying. but the pros just out weigh all of the cons: buy the game.",2
"after the first update of 2015 my arma 3 had to be reinstalled and when i reinstall it it uninstalls itself and i have to install it again.",3
"too many bugs. cant finish the first campaign due to a bug. multiplayer is boring, very slow paced.",1
"tried to get away from robing the bank, while getting chased by cops. i get killed by a stationed car that wasnt moving. 10/10 would never play again.",1
"arma 3: the only military fps you need along with arma 2. lots of mods via steam work shop and a ever vast developement team updating and improving it. with games like altis life which you can be a criminal or cop depending on what server. ride go karts dlc needed lots to do.",1
"+ wide military realism gameplay experience + great graphics + moddable contets and huge community - currently issues with slow servers(some lagging = low fps just like in a2) - big hw requirements",6
"could have been better.... one of the best looking engine out right now, but unfortunatly suffers from performance issues even on high end pcs. probably most realistic military simulator out. but i think i can say its nothing compared to the original operation flashpoint from bohemia. that was one of the best games ever including its expansion red hammer where your a spetznas. overall, would give it a much better rating if it didnt run like a turtle.",1
"i just got the trial and i still loved it its relly fun with friends and epic :)",1
"yea if you are a guy who plays call of duty or some games then this game is not for you becuse it is tacktickal and you die wery fast but when you learn the controls and the game then... it fun and i recomend it for the person who can toloreit death and to colect your stuff and check out my channel pls",1
"campaign is hard, even on easy difficulty. but it is possible. what i most prefer about this game is the multiplayer, open world, loot and a good community. theres tons of different servers with custom gamemodes, some of them are pretty awesome. but, i flow a helicopter into a tree. 10/10",1
"disappointing on several levels. essentially youre paying $60+ for an engine that mods run off. the mods that currently exist are pretty underwhelming, and arent made by the studio. they have universally low production value, and there are only a couple that are played. the insulting part is the engine isnt even good. its pretty slow no matter what settings its on, and this is with pretty decent hardware. maybe if you can get this game on super sale it would be worth it, but the amount of content in this game in no way justifies the price",2
"arma 3 has made me hate every other fps, because in arma you have the freedom to do what ever you want. the games modding community is great, which keeps the game interesting with new maps, guns, vehicles, etc. the game is not that well optimised but it performs well enough and looks great. there is a lot of great gamemodes that get overshadowed by wasteland and altis life gamemodes. one great example is teetimes captrure the island gamemode. the zeus dlc is a great tool to make cool missions on the fly and the great thing about is that you dont need a dedicated community for it, you can just jump on a public game and have fun. arma has incredibly detailed mission editor in which you can spend tons of time just exploring the map, blowing up some ai, learning to fly a helicopter, and so on. if you like shootters and would like to play something more realistic get arma 3.",3
"this game has great potential, but is killed by engine issues in multiplayer.",1
"game is all well and good. but i really hate the fact that they put the game this far in the future! the weapons are absolute crap! im shocked that they didnt just say to hell with it and give you ing lazer guns. i love the addition of scuba options and implementing body armor and customizing your own outfit and the campaign is interesting plus voice acting is much better than arma 2. id give this a 6 out of 10 because i am not happy that i am gonna have to download a  load of mods to play the game with equipment and vehicles that should of been implemented in the first place.",1
"best military sim available, if your pc is up to task, dont miss it. i switch between this and battlefield 4 for the wholesome war experience.",1
"i highly recommend this game. very realistic, very hard. what i like most about this game is the combat is not over in 5 seconds like most action game eg call of duty. also with all the wide range of guns and very unique future vehicle makes this game incredibly fun.",8
"with all the different multiplayer modes and missions, plus custom made scenario missions from the workshop, this game never gets old. it is a great game for hardcore players. the game is gorgeous. especially at night. i paid full price for this game and never regretted it. if you see it on sale, it is a must have for military fps fans.",2
"completely recommend it, its one of the best games ive ever played, the great realism and tactical ability allows you to do practically anthing you want within the boundries great gammodes and mostly good comunity, always going to be one of my favourite games, hope you enjoy it as much as i have, try it even if your not sure, i can almost garaunte youll love it!!",2
"it opens the door to a new world of video games through which the player is more than just immersed!",10
"bohemia interactive needs to get their flippin act together. i can play every game on steam but this one. that is a problem. obviously, the developers at bohemia interactive dont understand that software is supposed to run on computers. if a game crashes everytime you launch it, chances are, something is very wrong. thank you for free weekend is all i can say. i was going to buy this horrible game, but now i wont because i know that this isnt worth the time and effort i put into trying to make this game work. you had one job bohemia interactive",1
"do you like realism? do you like  fps? do you like amazing games? well, this is the game for you! now including: realistic physics, completely horrendous fps, and a generally amazing game.",3

"arma 3 is a great game if you loved previous chapters and you enjoy combined arms wanna-be simulators. its completely customizable and has an experienced community developing tons of additional content. unfotunately the game suffers from an old engine concept limitations wich makes everything feel clunky and buggy. the single player campaign is one of the worst ever created and doesnt reflect at all what a military operation is but its there so if you want to give it a shot.. plus the plot has almost no effort put in it. arma series fortunately relies for the 1% on single player campaign and 99% on community made content and coop multiplayer wich is the real core of the game. a must have if you want to join a clan that plays this game as a serious simulation.",2
"a fantastic millitary sim that never get old with all the differant gameplay styles and the rp servers its deff worth 60$",5
"i love this game! so many different ways to play this game whether its a modded rpg or a survival apocalypse this game, in my opinion, is the best game to get if you want to download mods for it.",4

"i really enjoy the multiplayer, especially the rpg servers, but the performance is not that good, for every player, no matter how good the hardware is. but i highly recommend for realistic combat and fun in general!",1
"this game was released as an incomplete game, but content is added on a regular basis. in a couple of years itll actually be worth the $30 price tags itll be by then. i dont recommend it at its current price, but overall its a very solid military simulation game.",1

"a worthy set in the arma trilogy, it takes place in the future which allows for more unique weapons/vehicles, though this some times can feel like a discomfort. vehicles, weapons, and movements at disposal are all vasely improved and refined as well. with such an active modding community and develepors that are constantly improving the game, this is an expierence you cant disregard. and for the graphics the lighting effects are the best ive ever seen in a video game (ever).",8
"in my opionion i prefer arma 2 op arrowhead, however this game is more customizable with your character (always a good thing) and it is definatle more pretty than a2. if your into the growing futuristic modern warfare games, this is a great one!",1
"i think this game is fantastic, and is the best standalone milsim available, but im giving it a negative review only because its poorly optomized and im getting 20 frames on a gtx 770 on all low settings. this only happens on multiplayer, so if youre only looking for the single player experience (you madman) definitely buy this, otherwise, only buy this if you have the pc to back up this games inabilaty to run well. ive played better looking games in 4k resolutions and gotten better frames than this.",1
"if you have aspergers, or just suffer from a mild retardation, this game is perfect for you. i, no different from people who play this game probably do it with friends, which means its another one of those games you purchase using a fair amount of currency, only being able to play it once every blue moon. the graphic capability of this game, combined with all the mods and possible actions on the game, makes it a nest for all that is nerdy on games. this game makes you feel you are more than just a fat, mentally challenged, reddit reader and  poster, but sulks into the deep portion of your soul which demands more action in your life, making you feel good watching the controlled fit digitally created alpha male move around while imagining it to be a representation of yourself. would give a better score if voxel mining were implemented.",1
"terribly optimized and leaves you wondering what the difference is between this and arma 2. the entire arma series needs an overhaul. the only keeping these games alive are player made mods. wish novalogic still made games.",1
"best game ive ever played , good graphics , no bugs , reallife simulator #bestgame2014",5
"very fun to play, but can be very annoying as well. however, i would still recomend this game if it went on sale.",1
"the possibilities are endless! :d seriously this game can do pretty much anything if you know how",2
"terrible game unless you plan on playing it on single player only, major fps lag on multiplayer you will get 3 fps for ever even lowering all settings to low or disabled.",1
"massive maps, the biggest ever created and every soldier got their own part to play in the war, some are medics, some are snipers, some are tank drivers etc etc.. and wow are there some freaking epic battles in this game ! ! ! massive maps massive firefights amazing graphics & physics so much teamplay is needed for this realistic war game! 10/10",1
"i had got addicted to arma 2 combined operations before this game. the semi-futureistic feel this game has did not grab me at first, by after a while i loved it. great game for modding also, in-fact, it is so good for modding that my mod folder is now more than 3 times the size of the game folder. bohemia interactive did a very good job on this game, i recommend. i give it a 9.5/10. p.s. do not stand on jagged rocks or rubble - the result is not favourable.",5
"this game is hard once you just play it but when you get used to it it is rlly rlly fun",1
"this is not a game. this is an simulator of you being in the military 10/10 would buy 100000 times",1
"best shooter i have ever played, its not like other fps games, less arcade style and leans more towards realism but aside from that, the world of arma is just simple amazing and beautiful, very well made terrain and cities/towns, you can lose your self just wandering around.",1
"well... to start off im not a very big third person fan but with this game i think it beats all first person shooters. i have now logged over 400 hours with in the first months of owning this game. this is by far the most adictive/relistic warfare game i have yet found on the internet or (steam) this game re-defines warfare to omg need more, i highly recomend this game to all who like warfare. p.s. in order to have loads of fun get a group of friends or forum a group to play with",8
"arma 3 has great graphics and sound effects compared to arma 2. however, ive observed many gameplay bugs while playing multiplayer online. also, the arma 3 maps arent nearly as good as the original chenarus map in featured in arma 2. luckily they were able to port chenarus over to arma 3 which makes arma 3 a much better game. honestly, when i first bought the game right after release, i was not impressed by the altis map - it was too open and flat, then when the terrain changed, it had too many valleys. it would be hard for me to recommend this game to others because of the annoying multiplayer bugs, then you have to deal with battleeye problems which can either kick you back to your desktop or not let you connect to a server at all. arma 3 is a tough game to play due to its military simulation style of gameplay and therefore i would consider this game a serious pc game. console games cant get even come close to the fine level of detail for player movement controls. the keyboard and mouse rule over the gamepad controller for first person shooter games. esdf for life, not wasd. i play arma 3 online with a close group of friends and its very fun for chenarus wasteland.",2

"awesome game!!!!!! love it... always fun, never lets me down.",1
"any fan of the arma series needs no recommendation for this game, it builds on years of quality gameplay. since arma 2 there have been however alot of positive improvements, and despite this only being an alpha build for now, it shows just how much arma 3 has build on and improved upon the old game. you can play it with outstanding graphics without needing a beast of a computer, and even the alpha versions runs smoother on my rig then arma 2 ever did. it still has its bugs, but none sofar ive seen break the fun of the game. for those new to the arma series this game is as perfect a starting point to get to know the series, as it like all before it, stand alone building their own story line. no need to have played the first 2 games of the series is required to get started on this one. if you like tactical gameplay, and cant stand the twitch run-and-gun gameplay of modern shooters (cod for example) then this game is perfect for you.",5
"after the 523 hr i have played arma 3 i have meet new friends i have joined and made groups and had some epic battles, its an amazing game, every thing is at it best in arma 3, the pyhisics, combat movments, wepons and many more! 10/10",6
"i am yet to find a more realistic shooter on the market, this game offers tremendous entertainment. conduct multiplayer operations online or with friends, or play special operations missions in the singleplayer mode with massive upgrades from the previous installment of the series. i dont recomend the game, buy it. now.",2
"the closest thing to a military simulator that i have found... and ive been in an actual government military simulator vr training ground before. also has one of the coolest communities ive ever met with lots of modding support. def. worth getting now at full price even if you missed out on early access and alpha.",1

"this compact model sedan has great interior crocodile aligator leather seats and nice city mpg. beats the subway by a long shot 2/10",1

"this is my first dive into military games, but so far so good. would like a little better controller support, otherwise enjoyable game. it doesnt have the polish that bf or cod has, but the open world aspect is pretty cool.",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. the realism is outstanding.",1
"well i got this in alpha release when it was $30 but if i didnt i would gladly pay the full price for it. awesome game i definately got 3 times my value that i invested in it and i am getting more!!! the updates will  your internet but they come with huge content. the developers are really giving people their worth in both time and money. easily becoming a better shooter then any cod game and is even leading the hard to beat bf series. my score: 10 out of 10 and it just got out of beta!!! cant wait to see what else the developers add to this!!",1
"love this game. too much content ,missions, and modding to even list just buy it now.",3
"the game is very, very good. the graphics and the fact you cant just rush into battle makes this seem like a great game.. however, wait for a really good sale. arma 3 is poorly optimized, and you will get loads of lag on-line. multiplayer (domination, at least, co-op missions with 2-4 players are fine.) is a mess. most of the time youll be confused and one-shot by aim-bot a.i. also, 10 for helicopters. gg. overall: graphics: 10/10 optimization 6/10 gameplay: 11/10 a.i: 5/10 multiplayer: for the love of god what is this lag/10 community: 8/10 overall : 9.5/10 also dem business practices. edit: dayz and altis life basically ruined the community, youll now see 90% of the people crashing the helicopter on the base or just shooting everything in sight. gg, dayz, gg.",1
"very fun :d i like it more than arma 2 mostly because there is swimming underwater :3",3
"it is a very fun game and i hope they will lower the price because it is so action packed. also i am excited for arma iv.",1
"pros: this game is just beautiful. very photorealistic! when i first looked around in the game it was like whoa!. i can max it on my gtx 980 in 2k at around 40-50 fps, multiplayer allows a large amount of people to play on massive maps. the controls are great, you can have total control over you player. weapon accuracy is realistic, you cant hit anything without being tactical. it has a great training section that i advise you play before jumping into a server. cons: the muliplayer... i just dont understand. i admit i havent done any research on how to play, i didnt know i had to. i have not met a friendly entity in any game yet. as of now every encounter with another play has resulted in them shooting me, tazering me or hancuffing me to sell to another more advanced player... there is nothing you can do about it, both the faction and the police have simmilar procedures. there are, it seems, 1k commands. it will take a while of remapping for comfort and accessability, let alone learning the bulk of them. conclusion: it looks great and is the most immersive fps i have ever played. so get it! very taxing game on the graphics card. screen shots look amazing, but the 45fps is not enough to be competative, so i will have to turn down settings =( or buy another 980 =)",1
"i am very disappointed in arma 3. i was globally banned for not playing for 5 months and they found something suspicious in my game file for not playing.",1
"this game is fricking amazing its got hd textures and the driving and shooting is well thought out and that just makes this a whole lot better. there is nothing i dislike in the game",2
"spent a whole ing hour trying to look through my ironsights. controls are  audio only works with $500 7.1 surround ur better off just wasting bandwith on pictures of kitty kats",1
"seemed slow, very slow compared to other games i have played but, well, i think it could get interesting. only played a small bit during free weekend but, if cheap enough, i would probably buy it. i know it says i only played 0.8 hours... that is all the free campaign lasted... but it gives you a good feel for the game.",1
"arma 3 is the biggest pile of  i have ever played. it is the worst game engine on the planet and is not optimized at all. it makes gaming pc explode. its terrible like its gameplay! do not buy this game at all, for your own safety!",1
"this game is one of the best i have ever played! its worth every penny! its also good for new players because of the new bootcamp feature!",2
"i really love this game. there is some glitches though not that much and is very fun to play with friends or teamamates. there are things like role-playing servers where you have to act just like you act in life and another is wasteland which is just trying tu survive. you need to find your stuff and survive, i really like this game and i could play it for days striaght without stopping because its just so fun. add me as a friend and we could play arma 3 sometime , i am always on :)",6
"played this game for 3 straight hours, went to bed with ptsd. woke up without pants. no one says you have to sleep with pants on. 11/10",1
"i love the fact that the maps are so large, it barely crashes, and its soooooo tactical",1
"the sheer scale of the maps. the roles its crazy though villanlia is alright. get a few mods installed and you can have alloooot of fun with it. this is the only milsim game ik that does a milsim better, though their are alot buggs i heard at least i persoanly have only ran into cliping issues. but its pretty good at the end of the day.",7
"from the guys that brought you that game with the takistanis comes a sequal in which comma usage is practically zero. the game now features less  factions such as csat and nba 2k12 oh and did i forget to mention now you can aim your rifle properly. all in if it i had to chose between rescuing an already redeemed arma cd key on a sheet of paper and my best friend from falling off a cliff in iowa.... dont know how the cliff got there, but i would chose the arma key because armsma is mein leibe armsma ist meine leute ich bin auto",5
"spent 60 dollars for this game played it alot played the alpha and beta to test the game then today got battle eye banned for no reason and cant play one of my favorite games ever, it seems like bohemia interactive is so cheap they have to use battle eye, a screwed up hacker security setup that bans people who do nothing i was on yesterday play altis life then today i get on to go play with a friend i get a ban message, they are too cheap to use vac that actually works and doesnt ban people that do nothing it bans people that do hack and break the game i have also been banned on arma 2 oa and i sent a support message to battle eye, and bohemia interactive, and then i got a bot that messaged me back saying that i need to go to steam and i did i went to steam and i got a message from one of theyre support consultants an actual person not a freaking bot i commemerate steam for this and i scould bohemia interactive and battle eye. i will be missing out on arma 3 life, city life, battle royale, and many other fun game modes because i get banned for no reason by battle eye.",4

"extremely fun and a bit of an adrenaline rush at times if you are playing wasteland or koth, recommend playing with a crew and get some comms up for the ultimate experience! i plan to spend more time pew pewing baddies and taking their loot! quite and amazing amount of detail in the game, sometimes im amazed at the littlest things i see in game.",1
"worst arma game in history. it feels more like cod or battlefield due to when you run you can see your wepon on the screen. the graphics are amazing but the graphics dont make the game. the realism is there due to the new stamina system and in vehicles you need more than one person to make it effective but they really didnt do what they promised like putting the take on helicopters flight model in so the helis feel like vtol planes when you fly really fast. i also dont like how it is set in the future because it cant be a simulation if it is in a era we have no clue about. and the weapons sound like your firing marsh mellows at people the 50. cal machine gun on the pickup trucks sound so quite when i fire a mounted gun i want to have the feeling that im shooting a 27mm gun with my hands not that im just firing another lmg. finally the nato forces dont have any jets in the vanilla game but the opfor and indpendents do it should be the other way around and also the lack of planes, helis and ifvs is terrible there should be more ifvs than tanks and thats not the case, if i want to take a patrol out im not going to take 2 mbts and a ifv im more likely to take a mbt and 2 ifvs im patroling not trying to take an airbase. those are the reasons you should not waste 60 dollers on arma 3.",2

"not a game for the casual shooter. slow and steady is the key as this is a simulator, not an arcade game. those who love combat realism will love this. with realistic physics, there is a lot to do in this simulator.",1
"this is the best military shooter i have ever played. with the option to download and create content from the workshop you have the option to play this game for ever !! only downside is the fact that i need to wait for the campaign but hey enough to do until then ! 9/10",2
"arma 3, a game for the few and the brave, but certainley not the masses. the realistic, and intense gameplay, accompanied by persistent glitching, and extreme system requirements make it a game the wearily excited might enjoy. arma, is arma, the gameplay is nunique has it gets, its a military simulation, enemis dont run at you with knives, and you cant shoot one guy thirty times. you play like your in a real desperate gun battle, or you get shot and die. the graphics, are great, but i wish the system requirements were more honest. with my two gigabytes of deticated video ram, eight gigabytes of ram, and intel i7 4700 mq@2.4 gigahertz. i run arma 3 with highest filtering quality, highest graphical presets, and fifty precent view distance. i get thirty frames per second on most missions, but around twenty in load times, and thats not half bad. just be ready to optomize based on your graphics processors control center, and in game quality control. in the end arma 3 is great, but taxing, the gameplay is challenging, but rewarding. if you are ready to spend the money, then just do mit! if not, then run away, with the arma series, its either a hit or a miss.",1
"a really good military simulator. takes a while to get used to the controls and learning how the game works, but its worth it.",1

"really really really complicated for beginner who never played a arma before.... lol just imagine that all your buttom on your keyboard have an action. the frendly ia is so stupid so when you are the commander its really hard",1
"after playing this game for about 20 minutes i decided to leave most every other shooter game behind. the scale of this game, whats possible and what you can do in it is next to none. you can create your own mission or try ones that other people have made. in that sense the game is infinite. this game has realism, tactics, stealth, weapons, vehicles and so much more. you can approach any task in a million different ways. 20/10.",1
"this game is  compared to arma2. gear loadout saving process is  and not working, optimization is , ai is . in other words, its a downgrade. keep playing arma2 until this game is patched/fixed",2

"been playing the arma series for a long time now. i love being able to control every aspect of a simulation, and arma has always hit the nail on the head with that (albiet quite glitchy at times). if you can handle the poor ai voice-overs, and endless amounts of shenanigans, this game is for you. this is not a pick up and play shooter though, it is truly a military simulation, so bear that in mind. with all that being said, i have throughly enjoyed the hell out of arma 3 and its beutiful lighting and most of all the user created content. if it wasnt for the arma modding community, this would have got boring pretty fast.",4
"be careful, you are paying for a beta game! this  has release in 2013 and is bugged as , crashers, glitches, all the  you meet at arma 2 this game does not seems to be finished and the devs arent really trying to the content of this is laughable is lower than arma 2 with that half futuristic  mods and the comunity are the only thing that save this franchise other wise it will be dead quick mod are not flawless the are very buggy more than the main game but still wort to get so if you will buy for the vanilla get off this is not a good game but if you want to play with mods you can give it a try i recommend you to buy on a steam sale to not be too painful for your pocket.",4

"there are several types of gudeg; dry, wet, yogyakarta style, solo style and east javanese style. dry gudeg has only a bit of coconut milk and thus has little sauce. wet gudeg includes more coconut milk. the most common gudeg comes from yogyakarta, and is usually sweeter, drier and reddish in color because of the addition of teak leaves as coloring agent. solo gudeg from the city of surakarta and is more watery and soupy with lots of coconut milk and whitish in color because teak leaves are generally not added. yogyakartas gudeg usually called red gudeg, while solos gudeg also called white gudeg. the east-javanese style of gudeg has a spicier and hotter taste compared to the yogyakarta style gudeg which is sweeter. gudeg is traditionally associated with yogyakarta, and yogyakarta is sometimes nicknamed kota gudeg (city of gudeg). the center of yogyakarta gudeg restaurants is in the wijilan area to the east side of the yogy",1
"this game is brilliant but has decent system requirements. i cannot play the game on high settings however i can still enjoy it regardless. if you are the kind of person that wants to have the capacity to create an infinite variety of scenarios for yourself as i am, this is a great game to play. the game is difficult and brutal, you can freely make your characters look like a civilian or a hardcore military operative. you have a staggering amount of freedom in this game and lots of strategic options involving vehicles including atvs, helicopters, tanks, and even uavs. the maps are extremely large and the game does not fail to deliver on any point.",1
"boss game, campaigns are really good so far... would recommend... the editor is the best thing.",1

"yeah i highly recommend this game to all people who like realistic type shooters and if you have played arma 2 im sure you would also like the massive improvemnts and features added. and this game has many fan made mods like altis life, wasteland and king of the hill to get stuck into. the delevlopers have made it very easy to mod in new models, weapons etc. this is a great game and im looking forward to future dlc and features. :)",2
"you have to get this game. addicting. thats all. bye.",5
"my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game, ever. were on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. im leading a team of 4 men. we come to a crossroad and i sprint across, telling my men to hold back. i cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. nothing. i run, my saw gunner runs, my medic runs. but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across. anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through? remember the sniper scene? the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down. he then takes two more in the chest. the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. he screams as hes being shot. crawling, drenched in his own blood. sarge? you aint leaving me out here like this, right? i-i wanna go with you guys! cmon sarge, h-help me! cmon! please dont leave me! he died after that. i cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.",3

"best game evea all i play tho is epoch mod xd its like the better versoin of all dayz related games(better than h1z1 too)",1
"shot a tank with a javelin, 5 guys popped out and exploded.",1
"arma series is the are the only real tacrical shooter games. if you value real warfare simulation and tactical style of gameplay, you must buy it asap! damn good!",3
"seems great, but not worth it at full price, too buggy for that. wait for a smokin deal",1
"it could use some more content and an introduction to modding without having to go through endless forum threads, but its a pretty solid game... probably the most fun game ive ever played. once you get past the learning curve, its really an amazing experience.",3
"there are many custom game modes such as: atlas life, wasteland, breaking point, and many more. i have had a great time while i played it on the free weekend, and will be buying it before the final sale ends. 1337/10 would weed again.",1
"with a big community behind its a must have for every fps fans",1
"the game is great, its very glitchy and needs to fix bugs but overall is one of my favorite games.",3
"a great game for military enthusiasts, those looking for a run and gun experience similar to cod or battlefield should look elsewhere though. its tough and unforgiving at first, but when the games mechanics click into place it becomes a tactical battle. the game is great for its multiplayer components and the modding community keep releasing some fantastic mini campaigns and scenarios. the world is huge and the selection of vehicles and weapons gives enough diversity to keep the game fresh. theres a lot of running and moments where nothing much happens, but this gives you time to admire the impressive graphics and vistas that are on show. would highly recommend to anyone looking for a patient, realistic and tactical experience of warefare.",2
"this game offers the experience of realism in combat of modern war. there are several different types of game play you can do. like all miltiplayers, this game escalates in fun with more people you cooperate with. the community overall is very friendly and willing to help you out if you are lost or stuck in a situation. the graphics can look really great if your machine can run it. it is both a first person and a third person shooter, helis, jets, to all sorts of ground vehicles are available for use. each vehicle comes with their own challenges on operating them. i would recommend this game to those who are seeking a real time, realistic simulation of what it would be like to fight in the battlefied in modern times. many variety of guns are available for use and the maps are gigantic so repetition of landscape is not an issue. personally im not the biggest arma 3 fan but this game is a solid 8/10 in my book.",9
">plays arma 3 battleroyale >find ak-47 finally >find quadbike >get the hell out of the city because too many shots >see someone on road ahead of me shooting at me >run into him >i fall off quadbike >i die >he dies 11/10 would recommend",1
"got this game on a friends recommendation. i tried the life servers. it sucks. the interface blows. plus, i dont feel like mining apples or whatever because i dont feel i should have to buy some kind of license to make dope.",1
"pretty dissapointed. to me, it doesnt live up to arma or arma 2. the campaign so far hasnt done anything for me, very repetitive, not much variety & i dont understand why theres been a month between each part of it. id rather much go back to a/a2 campaigns and replay them. i feel theyve been lazy in the lack of content for the single player side of things, not introducing any single player missions themselves like in arma or a2 & relying purely on the community for that aspect. for me, as much as i like playing online (through 2 very barren wastelands) i do like a good campaign to work through first and single player missions. id much rather play through the operation flashpoint franchise (bar red river & dragon rising because they were terrible.) as in my point of view for a war simulator they are still very much un-beatable",1
"the arma series is the best by far. in my opinion no game can top it for simulation or realism. arma 3 could do better tho. (no offence)... ... ... as it says in the description experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox.... i would love to have arma 3 go a little bit more into detail with some aspects of the game. but becides that it is amazing. i would recommend this game to anyone who like military games. if ur a cod or battlefeild (which i am but not as much as arma 3) fan watch out because arma 3 is the next big thing. > profile name <, game on!",6
"spend 40 minutes just to form a group with some guys to attack the enemy base and then my computer turned off. 11/10 would play again to do the mission again :d",1
"one of the best fps games out there, highly recomend this to any one in need of a change from the usual, close quarters call of duty type games.",7
"was tasked with roadblock duty, then within the span of five minutes it esclated from mundane tasks of the average grunt to joseph mangela levels of war atrocities. i rate it 44/44 slaughtered civilians. some major bravo sierra.",2
"i like the game, i played it on the free weekend but i couldnt buy it soon enough while it was on sale, so now i have to wait even longer to buy it, i just really wish they would lower the price because its been 60 bucks since the day it came out...",1
"for those who have played arma series, are passionate with military sims or are enjoying the lengthy(but worthwhile) process of winning, this is the game id recommend. although flight is not as good as the dcs, arma is a well-made simulator(thats right, it is not an arcade game)that simulates all sorts of experiences soldiers do during their line of duty. even if you dont mind your incompetent ai partners/subordinates, sp can be daunting; ai foes are definitely, even ridiculously, smart so you can be shot dead even if you make every precautions to prevent.(too bad our partners are not as smart). every variables must be accounted for executing a simple task. for those who just wanna play this game in a casual way, id really like to remind you this: you cannot be rambo, master chief, or cods protagonist or whatsoever to be winners, in arma. you are much more vulnerable than any of those mentioned heroes. you are in a virtual battlefield, you cannot beat foes unless they are really incompetent, un-coordinated bunches. regardlessly, for those who really want to experience what being a soldier feels like, id recommend this game. life is never easy, neither is this game.",1
"my first day playing a3 was awfull now i just cant quit ,its too good its as good as it gets now i know why ppl call it an army simulator cus it is",3
"only recommend this game if you like epoch on arma 2. mainly the game is good due to the community made missions.",3
"so there i was.... in the middle of a tdm server... i loaded up with my favorite sniper rifle and ghille suit which was not useful in any way, and spawned in the middle of the firefight. and then what happened? 360 no scope like a baws cod style!........ just kidding, i died instantly. if you want a first-person/3rd-person shooter game that isnt ridiculously  and made like a michael bay movie, then arma 3 is the game for you. im telling you, this game is one of the most realistic (if not the most) war games you will ever find out there. battle on atlis(arma 3 world) takes everything into account - how much gear youre carrying and how heavy it is (because with the new fatigue system, well trained soldiers have been transformed into chain-smokers), with sniping you have to take into account the wind speed, distance, and elevation; stealth tactics and just basic common sense. if youre the one who likes going in guns blazing with explosions everywhere expecting to get a triple kill, then youre in for a rude awakening when you try this game.",2
"awesome game. i thought i wouldnt run it on a geforce gt 530 but i did with 35-40 fps on medium settings. overall; game experience is amazing if youre using mods and of course its a tatical military shooter therefor... amazing.",2
"arma 3 is very glitched ad horribly unoptimized and yet is still an amazing game so i will rate it a 4 and reccomend it!",2
"this game tought me a great many things... like carrying alot of stuff makes you tired and landing a jet is hard without autopilot, but above all it tought me that bullets hurt like hell love this game 9/10",1
"arma 3 is the best military simulation game ive ever played. it incorporates all elements of warfare into one massive map for the ultimate realistic experience.",10
"this game is amazing, but its still a unfinished product so just be aware.",10
"one of my top games for the past two years! a must especially with all the mods (life, tacbf, epoch, etc.)!",4
"i can highly reccomend this game if you are into any sort of simulators, or realistic combat. i have had extreme amounts of fun with all of the user created missions, with or without friends. i reccomend once you have purchased this game to follow these steps to have an early look at the zeus free dlc as it can add a whole extra level of enjoyment with the mission ever changing due to your actions, in the state of mind of the dungeons and dragons role playing board game. this is ow you can have early access to the dlc: >purchase and download arma 3 >right click arma 3 in your steam library >click properties >up the top, you will see a betas tab, click it >the click the dropdown arrow next to opt out of all betas and change it so you are opted into the betas >click ok and return to your library, you should see an update for arma 3, around 1gb >if not, launch hte game, the update should now start >once the update has finished, launch arma 3 >from the main menu play multiplayer >from the server browser, find any server that is marked with a [dev] tag, this will be running the zeus dlc >play around on a couple servers, find which one takes your fancy >enjoy! that should be all i need to say, oh, have i told you to buy this game yet? jus jus just.... do it. take a leap of faith.",5
"arma 3 loads of fun. i have many more friends wishing to have this game however the 82.99 price tag is too high. please bring it down to 50% off again and they will sign up.",1
"amazing military simulation, this game is in my top 5. if you are looking for a game that has alot of replayability and a ton of game modes, you are looking at it. this game also has alot of different mods ranging from search and rescue to life mods.",2
"plenty of fun mods and gameplay, i would enjoy playing this with anyone.",2
"this game is great. this game get alot of critisizm over the lack of content, and i dont think thats justified. the lack of vehicles and whatnot is just a redirection of effort into animations, phyics, customizable loadouts, attachments for weapons, improved ai, smoother controls, a much larger map, and of course, how pretty the game is. if people whine about the lack of weapons, you can just point out just how many weapon attachment combonations there are and so forth. bohemia is a great company that cares about its fan base, and they try to get as much content out there as they can. some people talk about how expensive the new dlc that just came out is, when i reality, you get most of the content from it for free, the $15 is more of a donation then anything else. whenever bohemia add a feature into the game that the fan cry out for, the fan immediately start to whine about somthing else, most recently, bipods and such. another thing that the fan whine over is poor optimization of the game. the game runs fine, and if it doesnt, you could always tone down the graphic options a tad, it wont hurt the gameplay. tl;dr its a good game and it really doesnt deserve the critisizm it gets.",7
"if u like war and gta youll like this game its very cool huge worlds,bigger than gta and all those battlefield i highly recomend this game very cool not that many girls so if ur a girl youll be getting free stuff and alot of gentilmen are gonna wanna team up with u lol",7
"its a fantastic game for those who wish to play anything but the base game.",1
"very fun game with a lot of mods and a lot more always coming into the game definetly worth buying if you can run it.",7
"i have put a few hundred hours into arma 3 and its the wackiest military game ive ever played. here are a list of entertaining things you can do in arma 3 that i have also personally partaken in: you can set up enemy faction sentry guns to kill you and your team mates- you can tactically scoot on your butt to the combat zone- you can gather your friends inside a bullet proof room and bounce bullets off the walls and watch to see who dies first- you can have your friends get in a truck then proceed to airlift said truck with a helicopter and swing them around below you while seeing how long it takes before you accidentally swing them into your main rotor and crash in an explosive inferno- you can hide in a building while your squade mate crashes heavily armed uavs into said building trying to kill you- you can hop into a vehicle just to have it explode immediately after and kill you- you can get stranded in the water after your helicopter pilot accidentally sank the chopper in the ocean, then find a civilian driving a boat and kill said civilian to where the boat is just driving itself in circles just to have it smack you in the head so youre unconsious and drown- hands down arma 3 is one of the most entertaining wacky military simulator sandbox video games ive ever played. 10/10",6
"best game ever. make sure your 16 or older cause if your not you wont have friends.",7
"was awsome game. was. thats the big word everytime i go to launch the game now it says initializing then crashes had this for couple months now no support at all from bistudios or any resolved solution from other forums it it worked more often i would recommend it",1
"so i got this game and wont even let me install it or show in my library but to my friends it says i have it wtf.....",1
"the first couple days, can be really painful for most of the people, arma 3 is kinda hard to understand, its not for everyone especially not for bf/cod lovers, the maps are really great, graphics are awesome same as the audio, this game is made really good, not as arma 2. arma 2 is lagging a lot, has a lot of fps drops, playing arma 2 on 1920x1080 mid/low and i have only 30-60 fps, arma 3 on 1920x1080 ultra high/high 80 fps +++, half of arma 3 players cant kill a standing player, so the combat is pretty easy id say, the game is pretty expensive but its definitely worth the money, 10/10.",1
"arma 3 is the most pure pc game in the world. 10/10",1
"pros: -huge amount of guns and vehichles -multiplayer servers of up to 100 people -awesome campaign and scenario editor -diverse community developing new content every day -steam workshop cons: -movement still feels a bit clunky like past games -you need a decent computer to make game playable -there are to many life and wasteland multiplayer servers which can become boring -your frames can (and probably will) drop drasticallly in multiplayer games 8/10 average game",1
"this game is a worthy successor to the ofp franchise and arma 2, my favorite games of all time.",1
"still early days for me yet as i am still learning, but what i have seen from this game so far is nothing but awesomeness... vast landscape - the map is absolutely huge... some players end up having a full time job air lifting people to the hotzone and then back to base and pick up the next lot of soldiers... the graphics - are absolutely spectacular the sound - is amazing, really is an immersive experience realism - the most realistic military game i have ever played... if you are a call of duty fan... forget it, get out of this page and do not buy this game... you cannot go in guns blazing, you cannot even run from cover to cover without getting puffed out in which causes you to lose accuracy... battlefield players that feel that battlefield just doesnt have enough realism, you may appreciate this game as i am an ex-battlefielder and i love this game... the bad - extremely hard... and there are soooo many buttons to remember, but practice makes perfect... 9/10 - it loses a point because you cant just pick it up and play, it requires lots of time, practice, patience and discipline.",1
"amazing game, amazing graphics, amazing price i am totaly recommending this game!",1
"another great add-on to the arma series. i suggest wasteland for pvp only needs",4
"one of the best pc games ive ever played . the situations you can get in are amazing and feels so rewarding when you achive something you wouldnt think you could do. a must buy in my opinion",3
"awesome game , big improvment from arma 2, much better graphics, runs better even on my dated machine,better guns , better maps ,feels smoother ,great mods for it. altis life: lots of played interaction (not allways dm). do all manner of stuff to get money.be a drug runner, a bandit holding people up, delivery missions, farm materials, rob banks and federal reserve,be a car theif . spend on guns, cars, choppers, various licenses,become a rebal with access to naughty illigal fire power and cars, most fun iv had playing this mod has been trolling police , getting into car chases , shooting them in the face and taking their stuff or just generaly pissing them off, not played as a cop yet apart from steeling their cars and pretending to be one .. wasteland: its like battlefield on a massive scale and more in depth. farm for your guns ,cars and supplies, team up or not , make bases. can be really fast paced like battlefield or on larger maps you may need to go find the action. but it now , i heard they gunna run out of copies soon ><",4
"its arma. if youre even thinking about getting it, get it. it is that good. sure there are a few bugs but overall, they hit this one out of the freakin park.",1
"i simply have nothing more to say than that this is the most fun i have ever had in years. i got very addicted to this game in so very little time to where the point i got over 30 hours in the first week of playing and i am still playing the game for 3-5 hours a day. 10/10 would pay $60 to play, or if you get it for $30 in which i did, still 10/10 would pay $30 to play.",1
"amazing game love it, can be rage inducing at times, but in the end its all for good times, and good memories. 10/10",7
"arma 2 was a really good simulation of war. but when i bought arma 3 it changed my mind about everything its more realistic looks and feels good to play. the frame drops in sandbox are ridiculus. thats the only bad thing i have to say about it.",7
"a fairly realistic military sandbox, its getting constant updates and also has some mods. i cant wait for the full game, as it will have a much larger map as well as more vehicles and gear.",1
"very bad optimized like dayz standalone. the game could have been sooo much better if they would have optimized it overall the game is super fun but that can get taken away by all the lag and  so if you have a decent computer i would get it :)",4
"ive enjoyed arma 3 since alpha and its a great game.... ive spent over 400 hours on the game and id recommend.. the only bad thing is the terrible optimazation but over all its good!",6
"put simply, this is the only first person shooter that any self respecting gamer needs to buy. it has it all.",8
"runs like , i have amd 7950 and the game wont go above 30 fps no matter what i do",1
"arma 3 is a great game! it has some really nice grapics and is better optimised that arma 2",4
"arma2 with some new weapon stances, granade shortcut keys and zeus live mission mode. definately worth getting with discount - would not recommend paying full price if u got arma ii already.",1
"ive played the game during the free weekend and it is extremely laggy even in standart settings my pc has all the recomended features.unless it is a temporary bug that everyone deals with i dont suggest it to anyone.",1
"this game is really good. (a must buy for open world gamers)!!!",1
"first arma game ive owned along with great frist impressions.",1
"best game to enjoy tactical yet hard core gameplay in multiplayer",4
"i was playing it to see what it is like only to know how it feels to have a crappy computer. i shouldnt be getting fps problems. i was trying to figure out the problem. i was tweaking the settings, nothing. went online figured out they only use 1 core of your processor. i was really looking foward to playing this game but it seems the development team dont know what they are doing when it comes to computers.",1
"this game needs tons of work, and a new editor mode that allows you to make decently good maps that will catch an eye of a random player, but the updates are monthly just keep praying for better updates. also  all of the script hackers, you cant get banned from vac if your a script hacker in arma 3, its sad to see a half full server have to restart and still have te scriptor in the server after guesses who it is.",2
"good game, but min requirements are a ing joke! my pc out specs the recomended, and my friends out specs mine and i can bearly get 10 fps on any server. and he has issues with 20 fps. please optimize your damn game! i cant even play this anymore!! when it first came to alpha on steam i had easy the 60fps i wanted! i had not an issue with the game at all then it got ing rushed to release and all the fetaures that should come with the game are paid dlc, 16$ dollars for 2 ing helos? gawd damn! what is this ing ea? and sims? what next? running dlc? where you cannot run without the dlc? jezzzus. please fix this damn game or refund my ing 60$! - i do recomend this game, but take this as a warning! its fun, and nice to play, but please steal an alien space craft from area 51 if you want anything over 8 fps. - for those who ask about pc specs. i can handle bf4 maxed 120 fps. and such on other games. i have an amd processor and graphics card.",2
"next to no playing time at all but im already addicted... must get.",1
"guns. terrible ai. guns. look, a tank. mortars inbound, sir! this game has everything youd want in a strategic, ultra-realistic fps. pros: -lots of gear, guns, and items for a complete and unique look for everyone -maps are huge, with lots of detail in every inch of them, which can be seen instantly upon entering the game -lots of vehicles, aircraft, and boatcraft -controls are easy to understand and deliver complete control over your character unlike any fps ive ever played cons: -ai can be completely  sometimes -driving vehicles and running over very small rocks - and i mean very small rocks - will utterly destroy you and your vehicle -sometimes there are too many options, control wise, and you end up messing up on what you wanted to do, resulting in death -even on a very nice pc: i7 4770k, 16gb ram, ssd, gtx 780, online games reuslt in insane lag in large scale fights overall id suggest this game to anyone who wants to get into a more realistic military simulation. score: graphics 8.5/10 gameplay 8.5/10 overall 8.5/10",2
"this game is worth the $60 many different modes ranging from role-playing, wasteland, king of the hill, breaking point, tatical realism, and many others. this game is also more fun with friends 10/10",3
"well....i cant really comment on a lot of this game, because i suck , but i can comment that my gfx card also sucks  and they optimized it enough that its playable for me. so....you know.",2
"deffinetely the best game ive ever played. great to play with friends on wasteland mode. so much you can do",1
"its a very good miltary simulator. and great multiplayer. 10/11",4
"simply the best militry simulator on the market, even if you dont like that aspect you can play the famous mods like wasteland and altis life. you dont even need a mod manager for that (arma 2). its defently an improvemend to amra 2.",1
"if you are looking for a real army simulator, then youre on the right place arma 3 is the best army simulator experience you ever wanted with a good story line and the freedom to choose to do everything you want, there are no straight checkpoints, you aint going to be shooting at a enemy for 2 hours one bullit could kill you depends on where you get shot. this is straight away just the best militairy game ever made you have the freedom to do everything with the content creator. the only question you should ask yourself is.. why did it took so long to have this game!!! its worth the money. especially with online multiplayer on a big map with the freedom to do anything with anyone. see you in the battlefield!",3
"i know most people say this is for only really hardcore gamers and while that may be, im not the most hardcore gamer, but ive had loads of fun playing altis life and several of the other game modes like battle royale. 8/10 would reccomend to most people but the game is pretty unoptimised (atleast in multiplayer)",1
"an game that turns in to a timemachine when you play it. lots of content and gameplay. a must buy!!!",1
"epic open world game. ai could be better. a lot better.",2
"great game... buy it. no regret. multiplayer server is crowded with enthusiast people...",1
"i would of recomended this game but as i was globaly blocked from the servers i will not recomend it simply for installing it on both of my hard drives ! = global ban wtf is that all about",1
"one of the best shooters out there. on ultra graphics the game looks real. the combat is so open that it is diffrent every time. i put 12 hrs on this game the first day i got it. with so many game modes it never gets boring. 10/10",3
"super fun to play with friends. would definately recommend.",2
"just another arma. same bugs (with a bunch of new ones), same gameplay, same problems, same game. absolutely worth buying for anyone who fell in love with tactical shooters (any of the ofp, arma series or bf2: project reality). and not recommended to anyone else.",1
"this game is addictive. yet it has tons of bugs, its fun. if you are concerned that you wont like it, try watching some altis life videos on youtube, and buy the game when it is on summer or christmas sale on steam. now, lets get to what really matters. there are two sides to this game. there are the rp servers, and then there are the milsims. the rp (roleplay) servers are easy to get, it deals with altis and turns your gaming experience into a life, which then you have to develop your character and become friends (or enemies) with others. you can mug, kidnap, and  (if youre experienced) other people. this gamemode is for if you want to have some laughs, and a  ton of fun. if you are wanting the military simulator part of this gamemode, then go check the millitary simulation servers. there are fewer of them, but they can be still be fun. this gamemode provides a damn good simulation of war on altis. ranging from hardcore strategies to commanding your troops, this gamemode emits a real life enviroment for you to practice your gaming skills in. thats all, hope it helped! (by the way, i reccomend this game a lot, mostly for the people without large ing anger issues.)",3
"amazing game wish i had a better computer to play it on",1
"awesome game! love the graphics and how many things you can do in this game",8
"very good game. alot of different gamemodes. and not everyone is mean,",6
"if youve looked at this on the steam shelf and even been slightly interested, buy it. apart from the gorgeous graphics and highly detailed soldiers, weapons, vehicles and environments, it gives you an experience like no other shooter. best of all, it uses the steam workshop which means you can very easily download (in-game) scenarios that other players have made. this offers an eternal level of replayability.",1
"this is arma 3, not call of duty. you need to practice communication, strategy, situational awareness, as well as being able to listen!!!!! listening is above all else the most important. unlike fail of duty, you need to help the squad you are in when in multiplayer mode; not who can have the biggest electronic  and showing they are on the top of the list. all this shows is that you are a gloryhog and a piss poor player, but mostly an , that will have you excluded from future multiplayer games. also unlike fail of duty the calibre of rifles plays key as well as environment conditions, like bullet drop and wind. if you play call of duty, this game is not for you! go play with the other prepubescent inbreds, or socially/maturity  adults, to compare imaginary  with and see who is the biggest  of all. if you do like tactics and strategy, then this game is for you. again, if youre a call of duty player, look forward to the next craptacular expansion of that horrible series.",1
"it is most best fun fur whole family. i love da bugs da loot and dag00t",1
"i found this game a little confusing at first but once i figured out all of the controls and got the hang of it it became one of my favourite games! reminds me of operation flashpont: red river if you have the money for this game, buy it. its a must have!",1
"there is really no way of explaining this game to anyone who hasnt played it. its awesome. its fun. its total freedom. its a community. its dedication. its tons of bugs and glitches. its the thing you want to do with your friends on a friday night. its blowing  up, cruising with technicals and flying in helos. its at the same time realism and make-believe. its frustratingly hard at times. its long intervals of doing nothing. its modding, modding and more modding. its fps drops. its only limited by your imagination. its even more awesomeness. hell, enough talk! buy the the godd*mn game!",5
"this game is a gorgeous achievement. the environments are beautiful, runs unbelievably well and content isnt bad. i loved operation flashpoint, and compared to ofp, technically anyway, arma 3 blows it out of the water. it seems to contradict its self however: once all the great, well polished and fitted pieces are put together, you get something not only worse than the first generation, but so bad as to be unusable. if the idea was to make a realistic military first person shooter, than this can be labelled as nothing less than a failure. not only that, but the fact that representatives of the dev team on the publishers forum refuse to listen to suggestions for playability adds salt to the wound. the fact that i bought arma2 just before support was removed and arma3 was released adds lava and acid to the same wound. ive been a gamer for 25 years, and have seen everything from masterpieces to unfinished games released as such, but loading up a game and knowing i will leave frustrated, angry and feeling cheated is completely new. bohemia has lost my support.",1
"military simulation sandbox game.. its great with good content. if you find a good price drop grab it.",1
"one of the best games i have ever played defently worth buying :d",8
"buggy and not even worth the discounted price. i wish i could get a refund.",1
"rated one of the best simulator of this year, it needs some work, but mods help make it feel better made with the stock arma 3 isnt good. sure, it is the newest it still in development, i hope in the future they will add more vehicles and weapons",6
"this game is awesome, you have to try out stratis wasteland or king of the hill game modes :p",2
"best game ive probably ever played? i would really reconmend this game if you got a mate its brillant, its great crack, lots of laughs not buggy and fun to play even if your serious about it",6
"arma 3 is probably one of the best games ever in my opinion. the rpg is unbeatable and people who play this game like to actully play it legit.",1
"yeah, it has bugs. yeah, it has issues... but when this game shines, it makes whatever you spent on it not seem like enough.",2
"very nice game lots of weapons maps based in greek islands but if you dont have a friend to play with dont buy it and also very nice edditor mode where you can make yor own missions",1
"earlier today i was in a game where this guy jack would just repeatedly teamkill everyone. the person in charge of the game smote him with a ing crazy lightning bolt, and spawn butterflys on his corpse. then we had an atv race down a ravine, and the gm called a missile strike on the finish line. 10/10 would play again.",1
"if you loved socom, soccom ii, and even socom ii, but still wanted it to be more hardcore, then this is the game for you. ai is still a little clunky as of feb 2014, but we are still in beta. the game is huge! just like its predecessors this game is larger than most training areas in the continental us. and it is also huge in the number of weapons and vehicles that are playable. not necessarily for the battlefield/cod crowd. although you can change/edit settings to make the game that way, in general it is much more methodical. my major complaint is that when i put 2 infantry squads under the control of a lieutenant, the formations became very funky. instead of 1 squad on each side, the two squad leader fireteams were on one side, and the two team leader fireteams were on the other. but again, game is still in beta. there is probalb pluses = immersion, graphics, realism, scope, community minuses = squad control ui, issues with platoon-size units under 1 group leader time to get started on that foxhunt mission....",5
"this is a great game for anyone with experience with first person shooters. you might not want to buy this as your first fps game becasue of the steep learning curve and the amount if controls. but after some time it becomes a lot of fun. i have had a lot of good experiences in this game that i dont think i could get from another fps. it has many cool features that you just cant get from other games, like for example the ability to make use of any vehichle around you and use that as an advantage in the field. or maybe get a laser deignator off an enemy body and use that to mark targets for your friends. there is even gamemodes for roleplay. like altis life, and arma 3 life which can be fun if you like to roleplay with other people. i think the possibilities in this game are endless. you can make your own missions and submit them to the workshop for other people to download and rate, etc. i have had more than 500 hrs in this game and i think every one was a lot of fun. 10/10",6
"i cant even update it... i tried to delay the update but now it says that the update is paused whenever its finished updating. i tried to uninstall it but now it wont install... waste of money and time",4
"the game crashes to often i cant even get to the multiplayer menu. they need to fix that soon",1
"if you wanna feel like a god sniper who has issues with killing hundreds of people. then i suggest you buy this game. also never and i mean never .............take your pants off when asked. they do things to you that will haunt you when you come back from the war.",2
"do you enjoy constant ctd? get this. its all it does. get a good desktop wallpaper, because youre going to be seeing it alot.",9
"improves a lot from the previous games, but lacks certain key improvements to really set it apart from arma 2, like a redesigned addaction system, and multiplayer performance. still a great game in its modding infancy. in a few months there will be some great addons.",5
"complete game, looking nice, the maps are just incredibly large, a nice change of pace of modern shooters where your patience and camouflage will save your life. this is also the only game that get my hearts beating once the action is going on. very intense. multiplayer optimisation not quite there sadly",2
"this could have been a great game, the problem is the developers of the engine are stuck in the 1990s and made an engine that dont take advantage of your gpu. with an i7 2600 and gtx 780 i have between 20-30 fps, and i have that on absolutely maxed out settings as well as the lowest possible. there is only one reason to even consider this game, and its for the great mod community. but overall, this company does not deserve any of your money.",2
"very realistic, very action-packed, very referal. many of the machines and uniforms are based 90% on existing themes. nato tanks m2a1, and a4: based on the israel main battle tank merkava. csat tanks t100, fv-720: t100 based on the ussr mbt-t-95, fv-720 is based on a russian armored car. helmets, clothing, etc.: helmets based on m9 combat helmets (nato). this game, playing it, you will see many familiar clothing, guns, and vehicles. buy this game, make yourself a sandwich, and blow  to bits! hoo-ah!",1
"a very fun, military game that gets really intense.",1
"this game is a must have if you like milsim. it is very realistic, and has a great community. wasteland is for those who enjoy killing everyone in sight even if they are wearing the same camo. deathmatch is meh. coop missions are some of the best game modes. if you are new to the series, check this out, the controls are a little strange at first, but you will grow to love them.",6
"awesome game, graphics, plot, multiplayer, player interaction, rpg, first person shooter... the only hitch that i got with this game is if you turn the enemy skill all the way down and your friendly skill all the way up, it still takes about 5 shots to the head to kill the enemy. i highly recommend the game. its fun to play with friends and build your own base(s). fly helicopters, drive tanks, airplanes, blow stuff up, you name it!",3
"never played an arma game, but i really liked bf2 project reality and early tom clancy fps games. the pre-order was half of the future retail price and included alpha and beta access--so i thought i would give this a try. what i found was a half baked game that was overly reliant on expected croud sourcing assets. the game was bare bones with almost no missions, the engine was sub-par, controls not thought through, and gameplay generally uninspired. if id bought a physical copy, i would be selling it right now. huge dissapointment. if you arent already a fan of the franchise, you may want to pass or at least wait until it goes on sale for <$10.",1
"slowly slowly getting in this game. its got a little steeper learning curve to it if you played any arma 2 games. i heard today that a arma 3 epoch server is coming up soon. really looking forward to. espically to play a new map altis which looks really rich and eventful. i would look at picking this up in the steam sale if you liked arma 2 or dayz mods.",1
"arma iii is a so vast game that 100 pages would not be enough to describe it properly. suffice to say this, then: arma iii is not a military simulator. arma iii is the military simulator. of course, there are still many small glitches and bugs that need to be fixed, but overall we are faced with a product extremely better than arma ii and any other military game ever released. in a word: masterpiece.",1
"realistic, beautiful, and good gameplay experience. there are bugs here and there, but they usually get fixed, the game in my opinion is a bit boring due to it being in the future, with non-existing weapons. it is too bad there arent any popular pvp servers though. the game looks and feels much better with loads of good mods to it and is extremely fun to play with others.",5
"awesome game with amazing graphics and lots of different stuff you can do!",4
"its fairly rare for me to write recommendations in general, and its even rarer for me to find a game that ill keep coming back to after the 100 hour mark. arma 3 is definitely one of those games. im in no way saying its finished mind you. there are some occasional bugs, and sometimes the ai is really  or has laser rifles that pistol kill you from 1000m away (not so frequent anymore) but for what it offers, and what can be added via mods, this is one of my all time favorite games. if you have even one friend playing with you, youll have hours of fun. its really unbelievable how much you can do, and how much you keep coming back for even after frustrating encounters or missions. theres something for everybody in arma 3 (theres even a fishing mod for all you nonviolent pansies.) and it really provides a framework for you to do what you want with it. in all honesty, i am hard pressed to name a game that allows you the ease of introduction and ramps up to advanced techniques so smoothly. the more you play, the better you get (obviously) and ultimately, you decide how and what you want to play. the game goes on sale occasionally, so id wait til then, although i bought it full price and never looked back. its one of the very few unfinished games that i dont regret buying.",4
"well where can i start? i would reccomend this game because its one of the best millitary simulators i have ever played with a variety of different maps, guns and everthing you could possibly want. definately reccomend this to anyone who is intrested! -fbgaming",6
"you dont need it anymore theres a standalone for dayz",1
"ive been playing this quite a bit... its really pretty awesome. if you like arma 2 you cant go wrong. it fixed so many things that were wrong. inventory system is great now. movement and aiming arent clunky anymore. and it has steam workshop, which is awesome. its worth buying. i got it on sale but id gladly pay $60 for it.",2
"ive got to say, arma 3 is one of my favorite games. the base game is fun by itself, but the real fun comes in when you play wwith mods. arma 3 provides you with wasteland (survival teambased mode), altis life (an rp), breaking point (working dayz sa), and multiple more. this vast amount of solid content shows how good of a game it is.",3
"it was all going well until they called in an airstrike.",1
"great game, and so much stuff you can do with all the types of mods you can play a must get.",2
">be in platoon of 8 >get shreked by mounted gun positions >be only medic >run into open fire draging teammates back to cover >do this for all 7 other members >get killed whilst healing last member >get firing salute at end of mission by team members i love this comunity. i am big war hero. best exsperience iv had in a online game in a long time.",1
"great game without mods. even better with mods! my favorite mods are tfar and acre!",10
"oh yes great game! so much more advanced than arma2 !",1
"great game. shame bohemia has decided to go dlc on us.",1
"this game is a great strategy team based shooter but... it has a lot of bugs like the most hated and common dx11 buffer map fail and everytime i go to multiplayer it crashes my pc intel i3 intel hd 4000 6 gb ram",2
"amazingly fun game, to the t milsim, awesome cummunity support with mods and epoch. bought it got 200 hr and had to buy it again for my buddy.",5
"tried to land helicopter on top of a car while the intire rest of the team are fighting back the enemy. car blows up. kills 3 enimies. 10/10 best noscope sim 2002",2
"the cluster shells are amazing. made a flaming car hit a guy.",2
"great game! its everything great that arma 2 had & then some! another added bonus being that despite dayz standalone launching dayz mod development is in full force & now there are arma 3 dayz mods. all the pretty graphics, physics etc. that make standalone great plus all of the content that made the dayz mods great! the campaign is amazing, the multiplayer is amazing (zues now allows in game editing in multiplayer so a gm figure can change a mission for those playing on the fly). arma 3 is simply great! it has its bugs, but those are to be expected from a studio as small as bohemia & theyre rather quick about fixing them too. i cant rave enough about this game!",4
"called a military simulator but you can also do races, rob the federal reserve, transport illegal drugs and of course do military simulator stuff if that involves you defending a base against multiple tank battalions spawned by your friend who is the god zeus.",3
"can be much better........great ideas.............needs much improvement..............ah yea the ai........little joksters they are.......they just dont like dieing.............",4
"great game. lots of popular mods, great modding community, will be around for a long time.",2
"there is no computer in the world that has red orchestra 1 and 2 , dcs black shark - a10 and doesnt have this game. no need to describe my experience with this game. the possibilities are endless.",7
"if you have a beefy computer and looking to waste about 300+ hours of gaming then this game will meet your needs.",1
"arma 3 is like arma 2 except throw in tons of new features and new things to bring to the table. it is still a simulator, however it has improved from its standpoint with arma 2. unlike arma 2 with it making it big with dayz arma 3 is huge around king of the hill and battle royale. this game is very enjoyable especially when you have friend fighting on the battle ground with you! i do recommend this game to everyone who wants to purchase it.",1
"lacks the warfare gamemode which i thought was an important part of arma history, otherwise its a good game.",2
"its a nice game it is worth the money into my opinion.",1
"bleh, didnt like this game, i know a lot of other people love it but its in my opinion just a boring shooter army game. i played arma 2 and had the same issues as well. i dont recommend this to anyone.",1
"great game, epic battles, beast graphics and amazing gamemodes on multiplayer",1
"-spawn -get in chopper -get shot down by aimbot enemies -repeat 10/10",6
"this game has brought me hours of fun and im sure it will bring me many more. if you have the cash, pick it up asap!",3
"we had a argument on who should be squad lead, we then proceded to teamkill each other until one of us gave up. then the gamemaster lost it and spawned in 100 diving teams (on land) to murder us all. then a entire batalion of tank squads, and 100 paratroopers above us to top it all off. 9/11, a true military experince. -a graduated navy seal",1
"i simply have nothing more to say than that this is the most fun i have ever had in years. i got very addicted to this game in so very little time to where the point i got over 30 hours in the first week of playing and i am still playing the game for 3-5 hours a day. 10/10 would pay $60 to play, or if you get it for $30 in which i did, still 10/10 would pay $30 to play.",1
"one of the best military sims ever created. amazing true-to-life graphics and a real sense of peril -coupled with one of the largest modding communities of any game means this will never get old. i must buy for any military shooter/sim.",1
"best game i`ve played ever.soooooo many missions & addons. highly recommend for keyboard commando like me!!!!",3
"drove over a stone all wheels blew out. 11/10 amazing",3
"what needs to be said, this is arma, the penultimate of military games. if you are looking for a military game get this one, its based off of actual us military simulations. it cant get much better than that!",1
"singleplayer is an exercise in pain on high difficulty. game overwrites autosaves and limits you to 1 save. prepare your body for an autosave with grenade launcher rounds inbound forcing you to restart. great roguelikelike.",1
"great game, even better that daniel doesnt have it!",1
"great open world tactical combat game. buy it and team up with some friends and kick !",9
"this is a great game and i wuld recomend this to anybody that likes a little more technical gameplay and not call of duty  mode. does not run like a charm but it runs ok with max settings (4670k 4.3ghz and msi 780 at 1180 mhz)",8
"breathtaking graphics, fantastic gameplay, and a superior feeling to the controls since arma ii. the mod community are already blowing up on this. for those who enjoyed arma ii this is a must buy. for those new to the arma series, jump straight in on this, get moding, get building scenarios and i guarrantee youll never play cod or battlefield again.",1
"this game is good, yea? optimised this game is, yea? clunky not tin man like controls easy, yea? more features, yea? prettier looking than game last like arma ii, yea? play hard difficulty high, yea? need do attend to naval academy know to play how, yea? is good!",1
"the game needs some polishing, but when it is done i think the result will be damn good :) worth a buy",2
"too bad that there isnt like 50% button,cause i dont really like this game,atlest not that much like arma 2.maybe its cause of the map,or guns,or just cause of both,i dunno...the only thing that i know is,that its not that bad,so i would rate like 6,5/10",1
"crazy good game. im temted to buy it but its a bit too expencive in my opinion (and does not fit in my buget). i was however able to get hold of it for an hour (free download event) and it was good fun and enjoyd every second of that hour.",1
"ok first off holy crap this game is sweet. if you cant pay the normal 60 bucks wait till it goes for les( i got mine for 30 i think) i would call it a military simulation with a shooter twist. a great game thats lots of fun. you can be seriouse and treat it like its real life or just  around like i do most of the time and blow stuff up. if you liked dayz in arma 2 there is breaking point wich i play and that is pretty good but can get a little frustrating. but over all 10/10 would buy again. seriously if your pc can handle it get it.",4
"great game! nice graphics and much better fps than arma2.",1
"if you dont have a big computer dont buy this. i tried to the free weekend version and it worked beutifully but as soon as i bought it it stopped working i cant even load into a server. i still recommend this game though if you have a big computer and love to rp. i cant wait till i get my new computer and can actually play this game.",1
"very well made, robust and fun game. the graphics are great and the game runs smoothly. the one thing that annoys me are the controls that can be some what overwhelming and clumsy, but they have made them to be as realistic as possible. they variety and freedom of this game is huge and gives a lot of room for modders to create great content. remember that arma is not a simulator, rather a set of tools that aim to be realistic and give a lot of freedom to the users and modders to do what they want with the game.",2
"very amazing game best military sim and most realistic ive ever played",2
"great game, really gets you addicted, worth the money(check out , for cheaper price). still a bit buggy, and need some tweaks. but nothing major. youll need a good computer, but with the recent multiplayer updates, im getting better fps at this then arma 2.",3
"bought this game for more dayz. found many different life mods and a couple others that are really fun. great buy and i havent even played any of the arma 3 missions yet!",1
"good for altis life, little else to say thats good.",1
"this game is a must play! 10/10 would bang.... :/ its amazing! the best military simulator!",1
"fun game and the breaking point mod is much better than dayz",1
"better combat than arma 2. now are the guns better? yeh, attachments make them better. do they handle better? well, id argue that the damage system and how bullets flyed was better in arma 2, and that people move too fast when jogging in arma 3. but then again, people still play battle royal and koth in arma 3 so yeah, arma 3 is better.",2
"this game was a load of epicness.very intense battles with loads of non-stop action packed fun!",2
"10/10 best game for players that love tema work!!!!!!!",7
"brought game. played campain. got the hang of it. becoming quite good. shooting enemies as my team cheers me on. a friendly tank runs me over 10/10",1
"love how it crashes every 5 minutes. want $60 back",4
"this game is so realistic, i love it. this is the game youre looking for if you search for mature players",2
"why is your ing game broken??!! i try to install and it just deletes itself..",1
"amazing game, youll have tons of fun on it whether you play with a friend or lonewolf it.",1
"do not purchase. overpriced, lacking content. game wasnt fully finished after the beta ended. avoid and stick to arma ii",1
"true military simulator. it includes nearly everything that would be in an amazing military sim. there are so many things that i cant list them all, but ill do my best: pros -open world -realistic fatigue & gun movement (can be a con) -coriolis effect -realistic flight -realistic driving -realistic damage -realistic exposions & radious - if someone dies in your squad it can impact the game greatly -unlike many other military games, if something goes wrong in arma, you have to improvise, and you usually have to improvise fast, instead of going back to a checkpoint -no checkpoints -moddable -world/map editor to make your own levels or to just expirement and have fun cons -figuring everything out can be a hassle, and ive played over 70 hours and still havent figure out everything -the world can look untexturized and people are sometimes halfway in the ground when looking through a sniper rifle scope -can be a bit clunky at times while working in the world editor so overall, arma 3 is amazing and you should stop reading this review & buy it immediaty like, right now immediatly",1
"only if you are max operator can you fully understand and enjoy this",2
"everyone should but this awesome game king of the hill op &&",1
"imagine you got a cake. you cover that cake in nutella. you eat the cake which is smeared in the good stuff, and experience a wonderful foodgasm. i just described this game. i r8 8/8 m8.",2
"i really recommend this game because of its nice graphics, great singleplayer/multiplayer. i bought the arma 3 limited deluxe edition for $55,47. it contains arma 3, a map of altis and stratis, an awesome keycard, arma: cold war assault, a keyboard layout, a digital soundtrack, a digital tactical guide, digital maps and all dlcs. for its price it is just a bargain. buy it and you wont regret! :)",1

"spawned killed many civs were the gun shop was then i saw one getting held up so decided to be nice so i shot the bad guy took his stuff nice gun btw then blew the civs head off with my favorite gun the m1911 *bam* he fell to the ground dead will do this again but i was kicked off the server 10/10",1
"i tried to go down a slide. biggest mistake i ever made. thankfully there was a kind doctor nearby who saved my life from the evil creature that was the slide. notify the government, slides are lethal. and to think we let children play on them. science has gone too far i say! 10/10 for kind doctors who understand the dangers of slides.",2
"best military simulator out there for the civilian market. game is extremely moddable, and options and different styles of gameplay are plentiful. great online experience for players who prefer to work tactically and cooperatively with other players. as close as youll ever get to combat.",8
"worth 20 just for the eye candy, and still only an alpha!!!!!",3
"this game has come along very well i enjoy playing it with my clan we are a stronger unit due to items this game has to help with learning and it blows in my opinion cause we all have them is better than battlefield. ooorah!",3
"as you would expect,an amazing combat sim with lots of military toys to play with.",1
"you fall over air and die when you are whering the crappy sandles they give you dont buy its a pile of dog poo.",2
"this game is amazing!!!!! only wish they would release a modern dlc with models of that similar to arma 2!",2
"in the beginning the controls were so frustrating that i quited several times until i was determined to continue and learn the game i payed for with my hard earned bucks. once i knew everything, i had an absolute blast. from flying choppers, to taking a 20 minute trip to the main ao. the map is extremely huge! i like everything about the game except for the standard bugs (what a f shame) and the dlc. not enough content. looks like a rip off. anyway, i highly recommend this game for anyone who likes dedicated communities and team work. be determined to learn and i guarantee you that you will have a blast. you will enjoy the game and its community.",2
"ive had arma 3 for a while now, and id have to say it is my favorite military game of all time. of course it has its glitches and lack of vehicles and weapons, but those can all be fixed by the community. there are so many memorable situations that you can get yourself into. for example, i was recently playing some arma 3 wasteland and about a minute after i spawned in, i ran into 3 enemies. at first i thought there was only one so i took him out with a few rounds from an assault rifle i had just found in a nearby building. i heard him yelling over the mic during the last few seconds of his life theres a guy here trying to kill me, you guys need to get over here! so after i stole his hard-earned money from his corpse, i layed in some nearby bushes waiting to pounce on his incoming friends. when they arrived i managed to take out one before my rifle ran dry and i was left to the mercy of the remaining twos machine guns. moments like these are what make playing arma 3 a truly unique experience. i highly recommend the game.",5
"could be 3 million times better but its still fun with a couple of mates.",1
"this game is some weird  and i love it! heres a video of weird !",5
"love this game love playing it. still needs a bit of work like adding new weapons helicopters but other then that its a great game.",8
"too many wasteland servers. more domination and warfare please.",2
"reccommended for high end pcs and a stable internet connection. low end pcs can still enjoy the game.",1
"this game is probably the best thing i have experienced on the pc..",6
"best simulator. anything you can think of in the millitary is in this game. so tactiful i almost fell off my dinosaur.",1
"great game, especially enjoy the role playing servers. the only place someone will scream bib;ical scripture at you and shoot out your tyres outside of the usa. 10/10",1
"you can run around naked in a fur hat and shoot things, whats not to like?",1
"even at 10fps still fun, now thats saying something",1
"someone gifted me this game as thanks for helping them set up a dayz mod server. i started playing and got stuck on the first mission by a simple bug on the script that doesnt direct me to my next objective after talking to my co. the bug hasnt been fixed in several months... next time ill take cash.",1
"really great game and i cant wait to put in some heavy hours",1
"tried to do a backflip in a helicopter, didnt press z whilst upside down... i died. 99/11",1
"as a huge fan of arma 2, i really wanted to like this game. i knew it would have a rocky release, but its been over a year now, and this game still feels incomplete. of course its poorly optimized, has sli issues (my pip wont even work with sli), and is very cpu-intensive, but thats only the beginning of my frustration with this game. issues from arma 2, like the horrid vehicle physics, are still prevalent in this game as far as i can tell from having my apc rolled over by a pickup truck. the fatigue and weapon sway debate aside, this game still clearly has problems and is hardly a finished product *ahem $16 dlc that includes just 2 helicopters*. at this point, ive just given up on bis, and dont see them fixing this game any time soon. that being said, i have had enjoyable moments with this game, but just not enough to compensate for the amount of technical issues the game has. tl;dr: would not recommend to a fan of previous arma games, or anyone for that matter.",3
"arma 3 is a highly adictive game. there are tons of thing to do.i have only played 144 hours and still havent seen the whole experiance. multiplayer, amazing. singleplayer, amazing. you would have to do somehing quite spectacular to ruin your experiance with this game.",2
"military simulator with a steep learning curve. by far the most realistic shooter ever made. i love the game, but it is no run and gun bf game.",1
"arma 3 takes the simualtion to the next level. optimisation and stability has dramtically improved since arma ii and the modding community keeps the game forever fresh and renewed.",1
"quite possibly the worst game i have ever played. vehicle control is stupid. helicopters are impossible to control. your tank crew is borderline . enemy hitbox is the size of a pixel, meanwhile yours can be hit while you are behind a house. biggest waste of money ever. this game is an aweful scam.",2
"verdict: good reasons: on its own the game is a small disapointment from what we would come to expect from bohemia. stating this i would like to mention that the game is not even close to being a bad game the standards where just set very high. the game allows tons of mods about all kinds of things. this game is nothing near cod so you cod fanboys that do nothing else than cod please dont ruin this game for others. overall the anti hack system is prety good. this game requires a lot of team work so dont even think about being a stingy player it wouldnt benifit you. im not the best in reviews but i hope this helped someone",7
"my opinion about this game is that its bugged and people just camp worse than the camping in cod and bf i truly regret buying this game and i only bought it cause my friends say its great rubbish this game is no where near worth $60",1
"this game is endless fun but has a steep learning curve.",3
"i strongly recommend getting this game to anyone that has a good pc and enjoys the likes of battlefield and maybe call of duty and anyone that has previously owned a amra game",3
"if you want to play a real military sim, this is for you. it can be frustrating at times but if you play it like you should this can be alot of fun. my favorite part is flying the helicopters.",1
"i highly recommend arma 3 on sale. arma 3 has a learning curve bit of a learning, but is unlike any shooter on the market. arma 3 is a bit buggy, so expect rage inducing lag and glitches from time to time. turst me booboo, its most likely not your pc set up. with all the mods and servers that this game features, you are guaranteed to get countless hours of game play out of this game. the campaign story is laughable, but the ai is challenging if youre completionist. buy this game if you like: great gun play teamwork realistic firefights flying helicopters or jets survival mods fighting ai with your buddies pvp with a /steep/ learning curve pass on arma 3 if you dont like: large keybind layouts low framerates working as a team dying a lot not being rambo having ptsd carry on soldier.",3
"this game is by far the most approachable of all the arma games, and its a hell of a lot of fun. to fully enjoy this game, you will want to have some friends, and take full advantage of the avid modding community that bi has.",3
"it is realy fun i recommend buying it there are mods like wasteland and altis life those are really fun",3
"i have a love/hate relationship with this game. the action menu needs to die, the people on the game need to shove a big black  in their mouth and choke on it and a lot of other  that i wont go into. other then all that, this game looks spectacular, the most realistic game i have ever played. on my rig it looks absolutely ing beautiful, you need a beast of a computer to run this game and see its true potential. this is the closest thing to real life as far as gaming comes along. also, i cant tell you how many hours i have into this game and ive only had it for about a month! arma 3 is a must have, get this game now, if you dont have this game youre missing out on hours of fun!",7
"great game to start with it has a pretty good community which i value deerly. the game is pretty realistic, this can be a pain if you get shot and you dont even have a clue were it came from. although its a very good games its a bit of a bummer that the campaign is released in parts, but atleast the developers care enought to not rush the release, this would be worse. overall a good game although its pretty heavy for most systems.",3
"awesome military simulation, as usual with bohemia. enhanced gaming experience compared to the previous arma and a particular attention to details. cool campaign so far!",1
"i go into the game and play on a server where we were rebels and fighting the ai un. i started as a simple medic then about 3 minutes in im suddenly leading 40 mean agianst a few hundred ai. on our first mission we were trying to land in on the west coast and we went into town and encountered 2 ifvs and we die. but on the next mission were caturing airfields with the trucks choppers and tanks we needed. so we mount up and with our 2 tanks and support from the choppers we start heading an attack on a un fort. even though we lost both tanks we killed 12 tanks and cptured 3 choppers and split the un forces on the island in half. most of the rest of the game was clearing out towns and cities until we started hitting the uns airfields and forts. soon though i was leading 20 men into a large town. suddenly the ai drops 6 choppers and were digging to fight for our lives. me and one friend escaped meeting up with a strike team to the north. it was one hell of a ride.",1
"if you liked arma 2, then you will love arma 3! because it is arma 2, with better graphics and less content. i bought it, so should you. 10/10, will have to create your own game to enjoy the game you just bought.",1
"owned the game for 2 months and have never looked back... great game",10
"off to a bit of a rough start, but all the core elements are sound and the engine has been done quite well. buy it not as a standalone game, but as a military sim platform - good things are on the way here.",2
"ive been playing for a few hours and to be honest, i dont really see what all the hype is about. its not a fun game. its a simulator of how much it sucks to honestly go to war. ill keep playing and hope that i like this game later, at least enough to possibly recommend it.",1
"great game fun and action packed a must buy if you like fps and having some fun in altis life",1
"game uses battleye, which recently banned me without reason. (you read this and go yeah yeah, stop cheating. but i am a very competitive player and i dont cheat. sucks that you can go buy arma 3 (60 dollars) arma 2 co (20 dollars) and dayz (30 dollars) to have battleye ban you for absolutely nothing. 110 dollars down the drain.",3
"great gameplay, from karts to killing ai baddies. recommend over and over. another beneful part about arma is all the free add ons such as battle royal.",1
"...and i thought arma ii was good but this, now this is just amazing, this is what gaming is about. why are you reading this? go buy!",2
"this game is one of the rare game that has always something new, the community is big and has a lot of modders. you will always find something to do, but i warn you it doesnt run smoothly often and for me this is the only problem. i hope you will consider buying it if you are looking to play for tones of hours and fun! see you on arma!",6
"this is a great game it has beutiful graphics good gameplay. it makes me fell like im actuall in a real war.",2
"my first game on a3 brought me the most horrific experience ive ever had in any game, ever. were on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. im leading a team of 4 men. we come to a crossroad and i sprint across, telling my men to hold back. i cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. nothing. i run, my saw gunner runs, my medic runs. but i kept my marksman on the other side to make sure wed make it across. anybody seen full metal jacket all the way through? remember the sniper scene? the marksman takes a round in the leg as were running and goes down. he then takes two more in the chest. the kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. he screams as hes being shot. crawling, drenched in his own blood. sarge? you aint leaving me out here like this, right? i-i wanna go with you guys! cmon sarge, h-help me! cmon! please dont leave me! he died after that. i cried and he respawned. 11/10, would recommend getting.",3
"great military simulator with heaps of mods and fun multiplayer to keep you entertained for days, 9.5/10.",7
"one of the best shooters i have played, blows battlefield and cod out of the water.",3
"this game comes with tons of mods you can play like alits life, wasteland, breakingpoint(dayz) and epoch! awesome graphic awesome gameplay awesome realistic! 11/10 tire would blowout with net fence again!",7
"great game!altis life and wasteland are by far the funnnest",4
"bought this game for the breaking point (dayz) mod,but i decided to give epoch and altis life a try.it was a blast i had a great time playing with friends,so i tought i should play the campaign,im sorry to say that it was horrible,the ai was dumb as f*ck even at the hightest level of difficulty,and sometimes game would crash at the end of a cutscene(although this might be an issue on my end).so overall i think that arma 3 is a great choice for those who want to play online,if you are looking for a good singleplayer campaign you might wanna avoid arma 3.",2
"played altis life rpg for eight hours straight. made my first million. bought a chopper, and fully geared myself up. died in a fiery crash when the cops told me i couldnt land in a meth lab. lost all my money and had to start from square one. 10/10 ign",2
"arma 3 is the best game ever! if you have ever played arma 2, you know that running into rocks was the worst! wether in a car or on foot, the fatality rate was always 100%! but wait theres more! if you get arma 3, you can run into all the rocks you want! but be careful, someone decided there was an imbalance and so if you drive into a small chainlink fence, unlike in arma 2, your car has a 75% chance of exploding and a 100% chance of losing its wheels! cant wait for arma 4!",1
"best fps game i ever played just buy it and see for yourself",1
"the best war game ever made just got better :) buy this asap",3
"easily the best military simulation game out there, solid 10/10.",2
"wait a while before buying. its still pretty much in alpha. so many bugs. bad game play. and hackers galore! good luck & have fun... lol",1
"this game is amazing! if youve played arma 2 then you know what arma is all about. if you havent then let me enlighten you. the arma series is a 3rd and 1st person combat simulator with unlimited game modes such as breakingpoint, dayz, altis life, and normal seize and secure objective missions. jump in with millions of players and experience realism like never before. and for all the fans of call of duty and the battlefield franchise your in luck because this game has campain for you to enjoy with no 360 no scope . strategize, compromise, and defeat your enemies one by one in this tactically realistic military simulator. worth every penny!",1
"must get game wont beleave how good it is and dont press g and get us all killed",2
"i recommend this game to ppl who like real life war simulators but wat i dont understand is if arma 3 is so realistic in ways like the bullet can penetrate walls.. why is there no wounding system like dragging the injured and carrying them, in the game like the wants they had in arma 2..",2
"yes i would recommend this game its the best game :d",1
"arma 3 in short! the good: - nice graphics - good sound (guns etc.- but some problems with 5.1 ss) - large map - lots of gear - mp - coop the bad: - the ai (it sucks aaaasssss, like no other i have ever seen - really, both your team mates and the enemy) - animations and the movements of soldiers are robotic* (with ai) - (mp) server lags with large no. of players",1
"why do i have to pay 15 dollars for 2 choppers when the game already costs $45?????? so stupid",4
"arma 3 is the best game i have ever played it just looks so real my fav part is you can play as a cop on multiplayer and its a good roleplay game for you know stuff",1
"if ur buying this just for the campaign specifically dont get it, its impossible and i only play on regular i play most campaigns on veteren or hard im not bragging but im an alright player,however, the multiplayer and mods are amazing the world is absolutely huge and there is two islands, also it is the most authentic military simulator i have ever seen and the graphics are just stunning if your pc is up to the task",1
"arma3 is fun to play but i really just bought it to play dayz epoch",1
"this is the best modern military shooter out that if you want it to be, or it can be a boring walking simulator with no real purpose. but you will only get the second option if you are uncooperative, or a console peasant who doesnt appreciate how to work in a team or fill a role. well that only applies to the multiplayer, but that is the best feature of this game. the multiplayer requires great communication and a willing to work, but your reward for that is the best team based multiplayer since the 90s, although not for the same reasons. the campaign is also very good, easily better than call of duty and battlefield and the level editor is very in depth, and the graphics are insane.",1
"game looks good but plays like  can never hit target non stop 1 hits on me from ai even when in cover peek out of cover and all i do is shot the tree even when it is not in my sight buggy or non stop bad luck have no idea did not try online only did 4 parts of the solo story played more like a walking sim i am ok with longer walks to get to enemys to fight but when u get killed by lame  then have to walk again for 3 mins getts old very fast",1
"great mods for this game... the game style and feel makes it seem realistic.",1
"as an old ofp-veteran i never managed to get familiar with the sequels (arma, arma ii), though i bought them all and tried to play. the old fascination never happend to catch me again because of lack of story and broken gameplay (im not too enthusiastic about multiplayer...) i was sceptic about arma3, since it was pushed a lot via different magazines and channels. at first glimpse i seemed to be right, arma 3 without singleplayer, wtf? but: i have to admit, that the two chapters of the campaign yet released brought it all back for me. the old fever came back in a rush, nailing me in my seat just to replay mission by mission over and over again (you know, just to not lose a single member of my team...). gameplay is smooth, i never came across (or failed to recognize) a single bug, graphics are awesome, weapon handling is unmatched ... i could carry on like that for while. to make a long story short: you liked ofp, you are very probably going to like this one too, even if you couldnt get friendly with arma or arma2.",2
"one of the best games that i have played in a long time. the sandbox gameplay allows for many hours of great fun!",1
"most realistic shooter in the world. the best game i have ever played by far. it is very different from arma 2, but the main concept is still there. it may take some time to get used to the controls and keys, but it is worth it.",2
"this game is amazing. i tell all my friends about and they ask what kind of game it is and i tell them, a combat simulator. you dont go in to this game with a mini gun and kill everyone with one shot. the damage is realistic. if you shoot someone with a pistol to the head they will die. i was playing on a role playing server trying to cause a ruckas and i shot someone to the upper chest area with an assault rifle and they died. this is the game to play! massive maps. role playing, team death match modes, capture the hill modes, coop missions, seperate zombie mods (breaking point). this game should be a pc gamers bible. always on their side and preach it to others.",2
"buggy mess in which i get around 15fps in large multiplayer battles on the lowest settings on a gtx 670. oh, the ai on single player is absolute dog , too, but at least i get around 40fps on single player! :d",3
"sick of the same old pvp griefing in other first person shooters? then get yourself and a few friends together and play cooperatively. working together with your mates to complete missions is fun, rewarding and encourages true teamwork. there are literally thousands of missions available in the steam workshop with dozens of new ones each week, giving endless replayability. it is also pretty easy to make your own using the in-built editor. the ai in this game are smart, realistic and unpredictable but also highly configurable to make missions easier or harder to suit your skills. bohemia interactive also have a superb track record of supporting and encouraging community content so there are loads of mods to modify the game setting from subtle to total conversion. it is more complex and sophisticated than other shooters but so much more rewarding. get into it.",8
"me and my friend were driving along in a truck. i asked my friend are there any tanks in arma 3? he replies tanks in this game are like unicorns, you get them if you wish for them. a minute later we come across a tank parked at the side of the road. hmm did i just get my wish granted? we get out and inspect the tank. it appears to be not occupied. we turn to leave and hear a sound. suddenly we are both shot in the back. as i lay there, with my life slowly draining out of me, i see the tank blow up our truck and drive away. goddamm it why did i have to wish for my stupid unicorn! then i respawned. 10/10 would wish for unicorn again",2
"while it may have its fair share of bugs its still a great game. 10/10 would stick in pants.",1
"the story is great, the gun is awsome ,but some of the storytime is too hard",1
"arma 3 is possibly one of the best military simulation games i have ever experienced. pros: - wide variety of gamemodes - friendly and (mostly) mature communities - multiplayer allows some crazy fun times with as many friends as you can get together - performance is quite good for most instances (see cons for exceptions) cons: - performance in big cities with a lot of players suffers heavily - physics can be a bit derpy in some instances, and result in death - desync! do some research on it, however it is an arma thing - your social life will slowly fade away when you play this game overall: i would easily recommend this game to sandbox/shooter game lovers.",3
"this game is the most realistic war simulator there is. it takes a bit of time to get used to it but then after a while the game gets a bit easier. it is a hard game but thats what makes it realistic.",4
"greates millitary sim ever made, if realism interests you then buy it. 11/10 would play again.",1
"took a while to get used to but then really got fun, many different game modes and lots of experiences to be had!",1
"arma3 at first can seem a fairly complex game, which does take time to fully understand - however you need to remember that this is a simuation not a battlefield esk game. once you remember this you can come to terms with the game itself and in all, what a game it is. pros; gameplay/modes controls graphics multiplayer replayablity cons; tasking on system low fps in multiplayer without going into a full blown write up of this game, if you can set some time aside to learn the controls and the basic fundermentals of the game then you should enjoy it. the multiplayer is where i would say the game holds its own, think battlefield with alot more realism and mods. if you decide to pick it up, i doubt youll regret it.",3
"friendly ai took my group command and killed me as i was plotting to kill him! 11/10 hal 9000 ai, must buy",5
"arma 3 is probably the most demanding war game simulation, it is very much focus on teamplay and cooperation. the gameplay is flawless, the graphics are great and the environments are outstanding.",4
"worst game ever dont buy i played on my alien ware x51 and it crashes i havent been able toplay for more than 2 minutes straight its bs but other than that its a really great game so fun and emersive, but just plain boring and  though?!",3
"played 1 hour, got banned gg would get banned again 10/10",1
"how do you not own this yet, are you a friggin caveman?!",1
"aessome war sim but i wouldnt play if you have a low end pc (like me) cause its disconnects you from servers sometimes after saying no message recieved but i would defo reccomend it.",2
"is a super coll game i played this for the weekend and what can i say i will probably buy this game very very soon :)",1
"amazing game, then i found breaking point and was blown away even more... worth the buy!",4
"its a very good game to play with your friends but if you want to play something like rping then try altis thats something that is fun to do. plus you can be a cop, medic or a civilian!",2
"a great mil-sim, although its poorly optimized, which is the biggest problem with the game. even with a gtx 780 and a 4770k, i can still only manage 25 fps in cities.",3
"if you ve been in outer space and i dont mean with sigorney weaver ,youl have missed out on this wats set to become a cult classic a.n.b.a.i .were to start this is not for the faint of heart i assure you,from takistan life to motor bikes in the snow ,to driving yr own heli and tanks i cud go on 4eva,yes sir e bob arma 3 actuly arma 2 as well but 3 is the bomb and if you havent already got a copy well do some  around the house to help mom an dad ,without asking can i do some thing just do. but yeah the game its ok ....................get out and make the money u derserve it go now",1
"fantastic game, i reccomend it to everyone that loves realistic shooters. the multiplayer makes the game brilliant, the squad play is unreal!",5
"of all hardware intensive games we have, arma 3 has the best muiltiplayer. when we arent lagging around the map, pretending to be wizards, we are experiencing the wonderous 15 fps, which makes it more cinematic, especially when you are using textures that look like they were professionally spray painted in ms.paint. 11/10 would play again!",1
"stop looking at the reviews and just buy the game already.",2
"if you are into military scenarios, this game is great for you. with the new engine and actual physics aspects, it takes a big leap forward for the arma series. for me, it has been an amazing trip from alpha into the upcoming release, an was not in any way a dissapointment. i cant wait for jets :d",2
"it awesome game with great features and realism, definitely recommend it to anyone",4
"faningtastic game. it makes my eyes feel like they are ing. im upgrading my pc soon and i honestly cannot wait to play this sex-tastic game on ultra. it just may be the death of me.",1
"this is a ing  game breaking point does not working for me gayness and you cant alt tab out cuz its ing  gaame.",2
"this is by far the most technical, realistic and best military shooter game on the market. i recommend this game to anyone who is looking to be immersed into the world of combat. jump in and enjoy, but is like whiskey, you will either like it or hate it.",3
"ganna be bruthally honest also sorta spolier for you peaple who ever play the single player when you get to atlis its littarly impossible to ever get anywere in the game",1
"i have owned this game for a long period of time (since alpha) but never played it that much seeming as i never played with anyone however this february 2014, i have had a blast playing with a few friends; demonofsparks and theavengedkoala. wasteland is a fantastic game mode and i could not believe the time i was spending playing this. we all started playing at 10am and before we know it, it was 7pm. the time flew, especially when we are building/protecting our base, sneaking to the gun shop, stealing weapon caches, flying helis and aircraft aswell as crashing into little stones on the road and your car completely blowing up. this truly is a very fun game - even if the price is steep. so buy this game and i will see you in the wasteland!",1
"this game is outstanding, especially when on max graphics. its a really beautiful game and a good war simulator.",3
"for the little i have gotten to play i have fallen in love with the game my problem is i keep getting a d3d error and i cant fix it so the games just quits on me but im gonna build me a better pc soon and ill just play on it",1
"tons of fun in this amazing game! and if you find a cool group of friends to play with even better, but this is your cod of bf game, you need to take it slow.",1
"honestly i think this is the best game ive bought on steam. not only the best military shooter ive ever played but the best simulator and multiplayer community. there are too many gamemodes to get tired of the game and too many good mechanics of the game to get sick of it. i get pumped every time i open the game and hear the intro music and never regret buying it. i highly recommend this game to anyone.",2
"you only buy arma 3 for the mods. the rest of the game and missions are lacking allot! but if you like altis life and other mods, then this is the game for you. but the net-code is just as bad or worse then bf4 so keep that in mind. but this is not a dice/ea game so you should buy it and teach ea a lesson!",3
"it is sick, represents real military and you can do coop missions",1
"so much do i recommend this game. the gunfights are difficult and a few bullets are all it takes to kill. the whole game is gorgeous, just fantastic. i was worried the map would be bland considering it all looks brown but the campaign takes you to some of the the prettiest places in any game ive ever played.",2
"it`s a good game if your computer has a great graphic card and etc. with the steam workshop, it`s really awesome, like with dynamic zombie sandbox. its really fun, with friends, and can be a challenging gameplay. from missions to survival game modes or just some good old classic tdm`s/dms. its a great game, ill give it a 9.5/10.",1
"this game grew on me. one of my favorite youtubers plays this somewhat often so i was decently familiar with the idea of the game before a few friends told me to get it. weve played a few of the multiplayer modes and recently been playing the battle royale mod, (which is a blast when you finally get into a reliable server). as others have mentioned, this is more of a combat simulation. its unforgiving, which is why players need to use actual tactics to accomplish a goal. sometimes things get slow, but that only helps to make confrontations way more exciting. im looking forward to trying out much more of what this game offers, which is a lot.",1
"the greatest military sandbox i have ever played, arma 3 is a lovingly crafted game, giving you an endless amount of scenerios to enjoy. singleplayer gives you the option to screw around with the editor and either create the insane or the epic. its a challenge to learn but well worth it. the main campaign can be frustrating at times, but overall is a very excellent experience. user-made content and scenerios add another layer of depth, and zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer. multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game, giving an in-depth experience in many a situation. you can play it as a roleplayer, joining life servers. you can be a survivor of the wastes in wasteland, or you can join in many user-made situations. the greatest of the options, however, is proper, team-based objective gameplay. with the right men, squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds. it gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team, and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling. if you want a very-well made military simulator, offering wonderful graphics, processor-melting situations, teamwork, tension and combined-warfare operation, arma 3 is for you.",8
"this game has not worked on my machine. i bought it, but there is no way to get a refund, or sell it or anything. when i go to the makers of the game, they say to go to steam for a refund. when i go to steam, they so go to the other guys. 60.00 down the drain for a game that i cant play. this will be the last game i download, and i wouldnt recommend it to anyone",1
"joined a game, flew a helicopter into enemy territory, sneaked into an enemy base to try to revive my friend, got shot as the base was being bombed. 11/10 would almost cry again",1
"if you are looking for a proper army/war sim this is what you need. forget battlefield, cod and all the rest. arma iii is a sandbox true as you will find sim. not only that the modding community are 2nd to none, adding tones of extra content.",1
"doesnt run worth a crap on my pc. still dont care. best game of 2013.",3
"this game is super awsome and u will guarenteed get the best expeirience not only with the game itself but the mods to",2
"play this game for atlis and epoch. you will love it.",1
"a fairly realistic military sandbox, its getting constant updates and also has some mods. i cant wait for the full game, as it will have a much larger map as well as more vehicles and gear.",1
"if youre looking for a war simulator this is the game it is the best war game ive ever played graphics are amazing and the detail is awesome. it is so easy to get locked into this game ive played this for hours and never got bored great game.. thanks to the makers of this game for making such a realistic war game.",1
"if you like playing games youll like playing this game.",2
"game realistic and is stradegy if you like a fun challenge you should get the game",1
"after the recent update most of the desync was gone, marvelous work. 10/10 would crash the vehicles again.",7
"i would highly recommend this game. it is great fun, very good for simulating military battles and has a great community, which produce some amazing mods for everybody to play. there is stuff for everyone, if you enjoy quick pased action, you have king of the hill, wasteland for those who enjoy slower, more intense gameplay and even dayz has been ported across in the form of dayz breaking point, which is fantastic and everybody should try it. definately pick this game up!!",1
"there are so many mods and gamemodes for arma iii that there is no way to do it all. my favorites include battle royale (a hunger games pvp mod, sort of), altis life (heavy rp) and wasteland (pew pew!). its hard to recommend any game for $60 because almost no game is worth that, but thats what i paid for this one and i have certainly gotten my moneys worth in memories since.",2
"10/10 played invade and annex server was in a helicopter for 1 real life hour and then got shot down",1
"awesome graphics and plot but games playability is very low. controls are very hard to use. you can not change them in the way you choose. it is the worst game i ever played for 4-5 years. really annoying just because of controls. there are universal keys like t for chat or y for team chat, they are totally different. and another problem is that bohemia uses the same strategy for their other products like dayz. another not recommended game for me.",1
"i recomend this game to others, but i hope there will be more weekends where this will be for free or 50% off or more.",1
"its awesome dont miss it, there r so many rpgs so u wont get bored",2
"such a great game. once you get over the learning cure then its such a joy to play",2
"this is petty much bf4 but more realistic.. better vehical machanics, better graphics, and alot more recoil. i give this a solid 8/10",1
"great game, truely is. just if your expecting instant fun, like like you see on yt, just watch the videos, its more fun xd",1
"absolute garbage. complete alpha crap. buggy as all . 2/10",1
"arma 3 is as real as it gets in military simulation. i would rank the 3 main military simulator games like this; cod < battlefield < arma. i have played the arma series since arma 2 and i can say that this game requires more use of strategy and skill rather than the other two games listed above. it is not about shoot em up, get points, and level up. it is more like use your advantages and strategy against the enemy to push back or eliminate them. its about teamwork and large amounts of skill to win the mission. there are 2 huge islands in the game with tons of bases and towns on each. there are lots of mods and the multiplayer is fun when you find a good lobby. (i mostly play battle royale and annex). the single player is fun and long and the graphics are amazing if you have a good pc to run them. there are not as many vehicles in this than arma 2, but there are still a lot. the workshop makes getting add-ons a breeze. if i were to give a rating for this game i would give it a 9/10, with the -1 being around half the multiplayer lobbies having near empty or no people in them most of the time. other than that this game is a great buy for people looking for hardcore military simulators.",1
"i was only able to play when it was free weekend and i have say 9.5/10 thats a few hours of gameplay on a altis server though so yea pros fun as  cons if u have a  computer can get laggy other then that its awesome",1
"waste of freaking money. the game runs like crap, the aiming freaking sucks and theres freaking invisible enemies that can kill you even though yoju cant see them. worst game ever i regret buying this piece of crap!",1
"this is brutal war simulator. one hit can kill. stay in cover and watch your six. awesome! wannabe rambos are cannon fodder in this game, guaranteed. if you like realistic warfare game, this is for you. my most memorable game session so far; sneak through a large village, armed only with 9mm weapon and binoculars. was not exactly walk in the park but at the end i was armed to the teeth, thanks to (less) friendly soldiers who kindly donated their gears to me ;)",1
"ive played vary little of this game but i do forsee many many hours of fun gameplay in the future !",1
"10/10 best game for players that love tema work!!!!!!!",7
"this a great game if you liked arma 2 you will. love this game",8
"realistic sounds and graphics with a touch of robot like radio chatter, little bit buggy at sometimes but i recommend it to the people that like simulation games",1
"virtual reality engine is just awesome :) tons of content to play!!",3
"this is the best military sim i have ever played it is very fun way better then cod or battlefield",1
"this is the best military simulator i ever see graphics are like in real life and life is low like in real life everything is like in real life download this if you like to learn about military and weapons and vehicles this is most awesome military game i ever see",1
"it make me want to be a solider. it is a really good game if you can do an editor you can play it all day. so realistic .",1
"these graphics are better then my eye-sight.. but the game runs like crap",3
"11/10 ruined my entire life. arma will ruin every single military shooter on the planet for you. if you are looking for a game that will completely cut you off from civilization, arma is the game for you!",5
"yes i red rconnend it but its not working on my computer it was a waste of money",1
"hella realistic, quite boring if youre into fast action, but fun if you like slow strategy.",1
"ive played dayz and this game totally beats it. with the customization available, there is really nothing bad about this game. there is occationally lag spikes and fps drops but thats probably just me. great game!",1
"this game is awsome, if you are looking for a military based game that is as real as a game can get, then this game has your name writen all over it. you need communication, team work, and strategy to win, lone wolfing it or running guns blazin will fail like there is no tomorrow!",1
"best military simulation game ever made, since ghost recon",3
"brilliant game but be sure to buy it on  as its really to exspensive for what you get. what you do get is a brilliant campaign, top of the line graphics. weapons, sounds, vehicles and the map are very well done! multiplayer is fun and easy to make friends on e.g (altis life) workshop includes a ton of content and mod support is crazy into-depth. i get lost in the maps theyre that big. however, this game is hard to run making expensive graphics cards seem like your entry cards, that may be a beta thing but you definatly wont have 60 fps unless you have a gtx titan. overall i reccomend this game 8/10 hours of fun",1
"this game is awesome if you dont have it i would buy it.",8
"needs better veicle vs player gunplay, if someone is in a helicopter the people on the ground have no chance.",1
"in altis life cops arest you for no reason 10/10 buy this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"dont buy this game expecting a quick fps twitch shooter, this is a tactical military simulation. yes, you do sometimes have to be quick with a rifle, but a lot of the game is getting the right rifle into the right place at the right time. plan your attack. prioritise your targets. place your team. only then, do you open fire. and remember, in every war, theres always luck and chance that plays a hand. its a great game, if you are prepared to to put the time in to play it properly.",7
"this is a super realistic millitary based game. i mean whats not to love?",1
"great game, atlis life, island life, dayz, and epoch mod. cant wait !!!!!!!",1
"easily one of the better military games i have played. really gets the player involved with the battlefield.",1
"this game is amazing, personally it blows cod and battlefield out of the water, then again those two arent exactly milsims, however this game is just brilliant, one minute you can be running through woods not an enemy in sight, next minute youll be surrounded by a squad of enemy soldiers and youre just screwed 10/10",2
"this game is deadly. i dont think anyone can recreate what you guys have done! i cant wait for future products! briliant game.",1
"game is really fun. its not some game like cod where you can run and gun. no this game needs tactics and good team communication. the graphics are also amazing 9999/10 - ign",1
"shot a grown man parachuting down in his underwear. 10/10",3
"sucks big time!!! i have a i5 @ 3.0ghz, 250gb ssd, r7 260 ati with 2gb, 4gb ram, 600w power, windows 7 home premium 32bit and the damn thing says that my adapter does not support direct x 10... it took me 3 days to download from server. i have 50mbps internet connection and when finaly it was complete, it didnt even start!!! sucks big time!!!",1
"complex but fun especially if you have friends to play with. - i didnt like it in the beginning i found it rigid and complex, mainly because i was comparing it to the other fps games in the market + very good gameplay + fancy graphics and physics are good + huge community contribution - you will walk a lot and you will be lost in the beginning i recommend it :)",2
"coming from the guys who made arma 2 and became well known because of the dayz mod, you could expect another dads game with guns and realism... it has dlcs and all the stuff that the cool kids have these days. tenouttaten/10",1
"good game, read my review on arma 2 oa for pretty much what you need to know. game is roughly the same in my opinion",1
"this is a military sandbox game ive never seen before..with mcc 4 mod i can make my own custom mission easily. but i dont know how to make a character modelling as a new unit. im not a 3dsmax / blender expert so can anyone show me the way to do so..actually now i want the indonesian armed forces pack so bad..",2
"awesome game played it on the weekend with my friend",1
"i launched a beachead with fighters and stuff it was cool",1
"very fun and well thought out. single player is exciting and definitely not to easy. multiplayer i get horrible framerates and lag, but that is probably my system/connection. i will definitely keep playing it and recommending it to friends especially as mods are released.",2
"dis gaem reel bad optimizine but its k cuz i get los of fps so its sweglyf",1
"this is the most buggy game i have ever played in my life. i had all settings turned down to low so that i could work my way up to see what settings i could use comfortably but once i turned shadows on all the characters and guns went multicoloured and it put the fps down from 60fps to 1fps.",1
"great game. imo, more realistic than arma 2, better graphics engine. i was able to run it in 1600x960p. recoil is not that of a damn barrett .50 cal when you are shooting a pistol. cooler story and just overall an advancement from arma 2. op af",1
"arma 3 is an awesome, intense and realistic shooter ( besides the fact that you run for 10 seconds and then your character starts to waddle around) 8/10",2
"fun army simulator game, although i play it for the rpg city life element. its also less buggy in comparison to its predecessor, arma 2.",2
"great game, hate that the dlc comes up in my game, i would buy for the right price, purchased carts, maybe if helicopers was priced around $5.00 that would be exceptable, since at this time i dont have it, i would like to see the dlc ads in my game gone, mods and dlc are great dont get me wrong, just no need for it in game.",3
"thought you could be a soldier? think again! arma 3 throws the player into a near realistic shooter designed to test the best of gamers. a honourable challenge to any and all.",1
"extremely awesome and getting better all the time. :)",1
"this is a very good game that is worth what i paid for it.",1
"a really good game. its realistic and has a lot of possibilities.",2
"this is a really good game with amazing graphics. best to play with friends and to communicate.",2
"the game is very overpriced but if youre a fan of military simulator you should buy it",1
"the aiming and shooting is , ive tried everything i could think of, changing mouse sensitivity and quality but it doesnt seem to have any kind of effect at all, its unplayable, waste of money",1
"dont believe the neckbeards saying its a military simulator. its immersive to an extent, but a mid level cod player could drop in with no problem. you see guys you shoot guys. the difference being there 500 meters away in tanks with thermal vision.",2
"a highly tactical kind of fps, what with it being a mil-sim and all. this is a great game for those who want to take fps at a slower and more calculating pace, and it definitely rewards you for being a professional player. that said, the player base that actually has groups to play with are very professional, regardless of age. i do recommend this game to those who seek a quasi-realistic experience at being a soldier.",2
"i have sunk too many hours into this xd nothing beats working with a 10 man strike team to take out snipers and at soldiers as you watch more people than you could have thought roll in tanks, jeeps, cars and a range of choppers. that being said it is a military simulation game and what it boasts it does is exactly what it delivers! 9/10",2
"well.... if you like being shot on a server my your own team for getting into the the wrong heli then this game is for you but it is very good to play with friends",1
"65/100 pros very good scale, and detail in the world allows you to see things miles away. a large selection of well modeled weapons, gear, vehicles. multiplayer if done right, can be epic and quite a bit of fun. these servers are extremely hard to find though. cons very poor ai - im talking drop dead liberal half baked hippie 2nd grade education type of stupid. no content - took almost 2 months just to release a few single player missions no multiplayer support - no real official missions or servers to help keep the population high. bugs bugs bugs performance issues missing a lot of must have vehicles and aircraft that would really add to the simulation. i would not recommend buying this game until about a year of patches and they complete the game. it is unfinished as of right now.",3
"i like the game when it was on free weekend, the campagin dialog is amazing but the guns i had were hard to zero and wouldnt shoot where i pointed but still thumbs up.",1
"brilliant... simply brilliant. needs some premium hardware to play, but other than that, it is worth your money.",5
"help my arma want stop updateing but it keeps adding my gb to the total",1
"the game seems ambandoned to be from the developers... has bugs and i cant find a multiplayer season with serious players to play. also a hell of the lag",1
"one of the most enjoyable militairy games out there. dynamic, with the ability to write your own missions, modding built in and endless customization. huge maps with millions of posibilities. there is literally no other gaming experience like this. even though it may seem a bit daunting at first, once you learn the ropes youre in for one hell of a ride.",1
"pros: great comunity cons: really really really poorly optimised. go buy arma 2 its only really poorly optimised. wait for a steam sale.",1
"this game its really fun! plus it has a lot of mods so the game types are endless.",1
"by far the best always in development milsim on the market. with gameplay and scripting improvements in the works based on feedback from the community, arma 3 will no doubt evolve into and even better platform for any ultimate military (and yes... zombie *sigh*) scenarios you can dream up",6
"so many different games to play.. buy for a great time and endless nights of fun",2
"absolutely incredible game, a sandbox more than anything else with practically limitless possibilities. whether you prefer to role play, simulate actual battle scenarios or simply blow stuff up with advanced modern weaponry this game can cater for it all. whilst you do get some performance issues, especially on lower spec systems they are really nothing which should put you off. i recommend this 100% to any gamer.",3
"in modern war, you will die like a dog without any good reasons. the first thing ive learned in arma 3 online battle is surviving, not shooting, and that is what real war will teach you.",2
"arma 3 is clearly a step forward compared to arma 2. interesting new mechanics and more smoother gameplay compared to the previous game. but still, this game could be complete  because all the bugs and d-sync. but all of the creative people who have made many interesting mods and missions make this game such a masterpiece. i have spent so much time playing this game. the community of this game is the best i have seen so far. arma 3s playerbase is like one big family. but then there are the s, but they are kinda rare nowadays. this game has made me laugh and cry so many times because the bugs and some epic and stupid moments. the only bad thing i say about this game is that it is getting less realistic compared to arma 2. arma 2 has mods that make it a real mil-sim. this game is more like slow-paced open world bf with some realistic stuff. i rate this game 8/10.",9
"this is a very good game that is worth what i paid for it.",1
"as of the last update, my computer now bluescreens whenever i push the multiplayer button. it worked perfectly until the update. i can only assume that once again, bis has attempted to divide by zero, and then posted up the results for download - without bothing to see if anything actually worked. if you havent bought this game yet, understand that this is typical bis behavior. its one thing if the game crashes to desktop; its quite another when the negligent quality control proceedures cause an error that is potentially system damaging. as you might imagine, im not very amused.",3
"i really have enjoyed this game. it is very fun and really realistic. the only concern is the macincs the way the shooting works is a bit diffrent so beware but other than that and some rare glitches i would recommend this game",2
"most realistic military simulation game ive ever played.",1
"this game is really fun i would stongly recomend it. it is good to have freinds to play with.",1
"this game needs a good pc but its worth getting one for it. being a sandbox moddable game its less of a game and a engine for tons of games. once you mod it has every option to play from super realistic (as much as a game could offer) to halo type games.",8
"a really great military simulator. the amount of content and detail in this game is great and will give you hours of fun to have! from a great sp campaign to a diverse and intense mp along with co op missions with friends, there is endless content in arma 3!!",2
"game had great introduction and i had fun. i dont know what it says about a war game when the most enjoyable part was the driving bits though... there was also quite lot of lag and frame rate kept jumping. i also had problems with achievements so that they did not come up when i got them, they came hours late or not at all. game had problems but i still recommend it because it was fun.",1
"went to war in a kart driver outfit and got shot in the head. 11/10",1
"i think it is a bit over priced but it still is very fun. my favorate thing is the editor because you can spawn in anything you like and mess around with everything! altis life is a really cool mod for arma 3 aswell so you should try that out if you get arma 3.",2
"great milsim, good ballistics, powerful editor, endless replayability, this game has it all. with the new dlcs coming out this game will only get better. the only thing i could complain about is the ai. they are a bit overpowered. however, the multiplayer makes up for it. i really recommend samatras king of the hill. even with all this, i suggest you pick this up while its on sale. if you ask me, its a little expensive for what it has to offer.",4
"extremley fun, extremely low price and a great amount of content, if you liked the previous arma games then its a no-brainer, buy it!",3
"totally worth buy if youre into strategic and intense fps gaming. take good ol delta force 2 and rainbow six, let them have fun in the closet until they appear back in modern days, and you got arma3. it wont give you any mercy, you die a lot, but im 100% sure this game will teach you how to be better soldier also in real life. never gonna miss those headshots again. over and out.",1
"after trying for about 5 hours in vain to just get past a small phase in a mission in the game, i can finally say i gave up. above the insanely hardcore combat system, i got killed countless times by mines that i cant understand how to tell their location, so its just a simple, annoying, random death. also the game has a lot of bugs, mainly graphic. id say the devs rushed too much. 5/10 game health, 3/10 gameplay, 8/10 graphics, -30/10 gameplay forgiveness. bought the game when it was 50% off and i regret spending every and each $ for this game which i just cant play.",1
"this is a great military simulator with a great campagin that is actually a good campagin and i highly reccomend this game for the 60.00 usd it is, also has very many good gamemodes and servers, also has a great community and is nothing like arma 2",2
"this is the game! ive been playing bohemians games since the first operation flashpoint: cold war crisis. played all the next games and still love this kind of gameplay. theyve been improving the quality of it ever since and now it is an experience only playing can tell. 10 ou of 10 stars.",5
"bought the game, got around 100 hours. then i get banned because i picked up a hacked weapon in dayz.",4
"amazing game, plan on playing for hours at a time.",2
"love it. bohemia has really outdone themselves. the campaign grows constantley with each update. multiplayer is fun, with official servers and game modes, or mods to play, or even just some simple scenarios with friends. love the multiplayer, and is super easy to learn through the virtual reality simulator, and the virtual arsenal allows you to see how well you fight with what gun. loved it",2
"good game, very good realistic military simulator game. 10/10 would arma again.",2
"i regret buying this game. it reminds me of the sensation you get after stepping in wet puppy  while walking to the bathroom in the morning.",1
"nice looking game but lets be honest multiplayer frame rates are a serious issue . minium requirments are a farse",2
"this is one game franchise ive stuck with since the start. back in the ofp days. the game has always deliverd with the best game play/simulation of any other like it. arma is worth its full price. sure it has some bugs, but the amount of fun this game can bring is well worth a few problems.",6
"this is a really great game if your in to the realizam of millitary from your home",1
"very well optimized compared to arma 2. mods are slowly coming out for it making it worth the money! alot of replayability!",2
"arma (3) is not the typical shooter you would imagine. it is way more then that. the really cool thing about arma is that its trying to simulate a real war scenario. that does not really work obviously , because its a game. the reason why i still recommend this game to everyone , is because it is still a really well made game. the amount of time , fun , effort , realism , roleplaying and strategy you can put in this game is endless. people always come up with new and really cool scenarios like sniping , infantry combat , underwater combat , mechanized infantry combat , air combat and so many more things you can put in front of combat :p :d. turning that around , you also have a really good editor to develop your own missions and scenarios. this game is awsome , and everybody whos looking for something new and good : take it! :)",1
"got called a  and got shoot down from the cop 10/10 real life.",4
"not optimized well, takes a beast of a pc to get above 15-20 frames on altis in kavala -- but damn its a great game.",4
"this game costs like $60 now.. but it should cost more .. because its awesome! yee! best graphic game ever see, nice tactics and the best thing is that you can make the mission that you wish for. and post it to others. and also so many missions are already in the workshop. would give the game a 10 out of 10 :o",1
"the best sandbox war game of the year arma 3 is a continuation to the arma series by bohemia interactive, taken to the next level. with increased player control/movement, enhanced mechanics for vehicles, weapon systems (if you buy it), flight models (if you buy it -_-), and much more! the control in tight spaces should be worked on, this is no call of duty, the controls are clunky, but are a vast improvement over the previous installment (arma 2). another of the top complaints of this game is the netcode. it is terrible under load, but again, is much better than arma 2.",5
"good game and lots of mods so you never get bored breaking point, waste land, altis life just to name a few!!!!",8
"this is the greatest game in the world my only complaint is i cant seem to get passed the part where you shoot your instructor in the head during the training mission",2
"if you like some realistic gunplay or some fun roleplaying type fps games i thing this would be a good buy for anybody.",5
"arma 3 on its own is not something that unique and great but if you try some of the mods out there such as altis life youre gonna freaking love it.worth every penny.",5
"when are you fix the game for cpu 2,3,4,6,8 cores haven, if you think that all people have pentium 4 with nitrogen and 8000 ghz overlock are you crazy! whay the game are havent status alpha, and what a price 60$???!",7
"at last, on the fourth iteration, bohemia interactive deliver an arma game that is not only expansive in scope, but also feels polished and bug free. the graphics are great, and the campaign marks a return to the story-driven excellence of earlier days (after the disappointment of arma ii). of course, as always, its the sandbox element that really makes arma iii shine, and the addition of steam workshop serves only to make this element of the game even greater. this is a game that demands patience and dedication, but it will reward you with the richest, most varied, and possibly best supported military combat experience available on any gaming platform today.",5
"its hard to recommend this game. seeing how they are trying to make a combat sim type of game its not exactly action packed. you spend most of your time equipping yourself, and trying to get to whatever objective your going for. then once you get somewhere you might finally get into some action. now this whole process can be more fun if your in a group & communicating and having laughs along the way. the first few days i played i probably spent about 4 hours getting around and finding stuff and maybe only got into a few gun fights. it takes a special kind of person to really love this kind of game. for me it was more of a novelty. there is one game mode where you need to hold an objecitve, this was more action packed by getting everyone in one area which led to less travel time and more time running around and trying to hunt targets down. once this game can create some modes that streamlines action into the sim portion of it would make the game alot better. all in all the game is amazing, and done well once you get past learning how to do it. you can have a great time with it if you accept how much time your going to spend just trying to get somewhere.",1
"i realy like this game, iv been wanting a game like this for a while, its like the audio from dayz but beter and the graphics are on ultra and run perfect on my computer my favourites modes would be roleplaying in the arma 3 life its fun when your a cop mostly i like being an innocent and then smuggle guns throughout the world anyways 10/10 happy to have gotten this game for 39.99 aud it was only 29.99usd now its 59.99usd but anyways its still totaly worth it",1
"you either hate or love this game and i love it! in my opinion its one of the best shooters out that that require skill. that is rare these days.",6
"buggy as hell, dlc is basically updates that should have been included in the game for free ? what the hell bohemia, i was excited for arma 3 to be released as i thoroughly enjoyed arma 2 oa when arma 3 was relelase i was very disapointed i dont think ill be buying another bohemia game due to the amount you ed your customers around.",7
"this was my first experience with arma. i was initially overwhelmed by all the possibilities in this game. but thanks to the awesome community (armaholic), my time spent with this game has been extraordinary (most of my time was spent in the editor). highly recommended. currently in the 2nd part of the campaign, and enjoying the work and updates provided by bohemia. keep it up awesome dev team and arma community.",7
"great game when it will actually be ready for release.",2
"if you want a game that really challenges you it, this will be the most fun you will have. a fresh experience and worth it",1
"one of the best fps/tps games ive ever played. if u like tactics, simulation and hardcore - try arma iii",4
"arma iii is a very comprehensive and realistic tactical shooter, its a must have for everyone who has arma ii and gamers who love tactical shooters. the graphics are magnificent, i love the vehicles and the variety of guns. 8/10, you need to buy this game if you enjoyed arma ii as much as i did!",1
"a grate military simulator, that can be used to play whatever game mode you desire, although it might be a bit cluncky at times. a grate time with a group of friends, and with many groups to choose from - one must fit you, but it is lackluster in singleplayer.",3
"arma 3 as lots of other people have stated. isnt your average shooter. youll probably need a decent rig to run it for starters and after that you will need to scrap everything you ever thought you knew about shooters. the campaign is fun and gives new players a way of grasping the basics of what combat is like in the arma world. for extreamly rookie players there are some good tutorial scenarios in game already loaded. a good addition to the series which will help anyone unsure of how to play. as for multiplayer and user made missions. your experience in those is entirely up to the mission creator and wether or not you choose to play with friends or a dedicated arma group. my reccomendation is join a group or find a server with a game mode you love. replayability is huge and basically infinite i would highly reccomend the purchase of this game.",4
"arma iii is an infantry simulation more hardcore than than cod black ops or bf3. im looking forward to playing in more team-oriented groups, rather than a bunch of lone wolves. dslyecxis tactical techniques and procedures guide is well written, team oriented, and aimed at the best player experience, rather than obsessive fidelity to actual ops. also check out his youtube channel for game videos of large scale missions.",9
"the reqirments are way too high and too good for my pc to handle",1
"major improvements over arma 2. set in the future of 2034, there are new weapons, vehicles, aircraft, and factions. the graphics are incredible, with all-new stance positions to adapt to cover or conceal yourself. there are two new maps: stratis, a 20 km squared military island, and altis, 270 km squared island that gives us the biggest map of the armed assault series. you will be able to do everything like in arma 2 and arma 2: oa, such as zeroing, sniping, flying, operating, etc. what you will be able to do that you couldnt do is scuba diving. there is a more easier inventory system rather than slots there is the amount of space you have. its just a great game; highly recommended.",1
"if you like being a terrorist (which i do) this game is perfect for you just simply set up car bomb and blow up infidel no problem!",1
"7/10 - an evolution from previous installments. nice graphics and solid simulation. great squad placed multiplayer over a massive 400km sandbox. lack of content hurts its score although more is being released and developed. more campaign missions coming this december. pros: nice graphics, solid shooter simulation mechanics. more accessable compared to other titles but looses none of its depth. great combined arms mp. cons: lack of content, only a partial campaign. no training missions and still plenty of bugs remains.",1
"i think it is the best arma seiries yet i totaly recomend it for anybody who is a total war/army simulator fanatic.",1
"if you need a tactical, teamwork filled adrenaline rush then arma is the place to be. you need to spend a long time learning the recoil patterns and even the wind speed changes how your bullets fly through the air. this game is not for the call of duty or battlefield player who just likes to run and gun. there are lots of places to explore in the map because its so big but in a gamemode like domination or king of the hill, youll be deployed to one area only so it will be a close engagement in that place only. lots of workshop content to keep you busy after that campaign is over but the muiltiplayer is where its at. 9/10 - only for the hardcore military player who loves teamwork and long engagements.",1
"exellent multiplayer shooter with great simulater mechanics however it is practacly run on mods because of its limeted content",2
"arma 3 is a great game. its the most realistic shooting game i ever played!",1
"good game and good scenerios just enemies can not see as clear and help is not enought. need more clear see range. but really good game for action",1
"got spawn killed by a man with a handgun, then he hunt me down just to take my clothes and dignity. 10/10 would play again",1
"i use to like this game but by charging for some helicopters has me fed up. hell the game is $60 unless you got it back in the day. im just getting tired of here buy our unfinsihed game ok heres some new stuff pull out your wallet this is some ubisoft crap.",1
"arma might be a game with bugs, but deep down its truthfully an amazing game when in multiplayer or in custom sp missions, add all the user generated modifications and the game is amazing. its my favourite fps even if it isnt run and gun but slow and tactical movement",4
"seriously i had never played any game from bohemia interactive until arma 3. and only reason why i bought this game was that is developed by czech studio and i wanted to support them. so i tried it and guess what... i found the game very, very interesting. even when there wasnt any campaign, there was an editor (key feature of arma 3). in there you can create your own missions. and whats the best? you dont even have to be much skillfull. the editors interface is very friendly. only few minutes are enought to familiarize with whole process how to create a mission. if i take to account beautifull graphic and very deep done almost every detail in huge map (biggest you can ever seen in any game before), i can only say if the community stay so awesome how its now (modders, mission creators etc.) game have big potential be best fps military shooter in singleplayer and if you find good people for cooperation the second best in multiplayer. (the king of whole genre is still and will be battlefield.) 7/10",1
"someone play with me right meow! this game is great. i wasnt too interested a year or two ago, but something shifted and i gave it a shot. this game is on my top 5 favorite game list. there are many reasons i love this game and i havent even played more then 50% of what this game has to offer. at the moment, i am doing the wasteland, king of the hilly type matches, but i am very eager try some casual rp with missions and objectives. however, i found the single-player campaign to be quite frustrating in some circumstances. i had terrible stamina management and seemed to get aim-botted by the enemy npcs all the time. i tried taking cover, sneaking, flanking, but someone always got me and i rage quit. i dont think ill be trying to finish that any time soon. 9/10",1
"i wouldnt see this as a game, but rather a platform that offers endless expansion. 8/10 for clumsy controlls but good possibilities. (good mods can be found, such as br and bp)",2
"i dont know how to get in to severs it kicks me out all the time why ??",1
"the popo always suck. the rebels want to get 50k for you to get into the cocaine field. theres always lags,desync etc. 11/10 love it as always. 11/10 u can rob people. 111/---1 bye.",2
"its a very good milsim and its big jump forwards for arma series.",3
"its a  game, you have no clue what you doing. in basecamp you cant hit at taget at 400m, the game dont explane how to work the scope. if you press careful ones right click you get the small red dot on top, if you hold it down you zoom in at the side of the riffle... wtf i want to ing use the telesopic sight!! how hard cant it be to expaline the player to use a scope.. is this game rocket science?  this game! dont buy it, dont support at game developers that make games cryptic. why even use x to duck and z to lay down.. why?",1
"i killed 4 cops and 3 civilians going 1 mile an hour on a quad. 10/10",1
"arma 3 is a awesome game, 10/10. many cools mods and game modes to play online and the single player is fair fun.",8
"game is boring as  if you dont have friends.youll die repeatdly and just get frustrated,eventually realising you wasted 6 hours when you could play something good like dayz. dont buy unless you have friends. and a good pc i get 13fps and im fine but ive never played a game any higher so it goes to personal preferance.",2
"i think it is the best game around and i baught it for how good it is i give it a 100/100 its the best",1
"astounding game. great graphics, gameplay, and more. whenever i played it i would feel either really relaxed or tense, no in-between. however my computer is  so i cant play it :(",1
"very fun game with a lot of mods and a lot more always coming into the game definetly worth buying if you can run it.",7
"this is a great military simulator. the interface and the whole feel of the game has improved so much over arma 2 its almost a completely different game. very accessible (if you are willing to spend the time), even for someone who normally doesnt like to put much time into simulators.",1
"i got banned from a server for being on the top of a gametracker leaderboard. 10/10 would get banned again for putting that admin in 11th place. i got banned for trying to vote kick an admin using a votekick feature that doesnt even work. 10/10 try to make a working vote kick. i once crashed a car into admins heli. got banned for kamakazi 10/10 would crash again got banned for vdm but got vdmed the second i got banned. 10/10 would be banned mistakely again 10/10 would be vdmed again got banned for running a guy over when vdm was diabled for reason vdm 10/10 would vehicle knockout someone again. great game but watch out for those admins.",4
"waste of money,waste of time. controls suck,servers suck, server admins suck, and is boring, all i did was get a good excersize by running. dont expect to do anything on any server but alot of running.",1
"i can see how much fun this game can be, but when im 1m from the objective and cant get closer to interact with it, and cant continue the mission until i interact with it... and its only getting in the vehicle, well sorry im not gonna spend 30$ in todays market on such a game - i dont care how good people say it is. i like the graphics, didnt mind the long install time, love the mechanics - crawl, compass, etc. i guess im pickier than most however, and wary of spending money on a game that starts out rather slow and buggy. i know we all wonder why someone cant get it right whith so many trying. this game feels closer than most others to achieving that rightness.",1
"this is war and it is amazing. arma 3 improves on every past arma game has done and puts it to the max. aside from the price and sometimes awkward controls arma 3 is truly astonishing. the campaign is ok but makes up for it with great gameplay and graphical beauty. the multiplayer is great and after youve gotten bored of the base game theres masses of workshop content to entertain you! overall ill give arma 3 a 8.5/10. see you on the frontline!",1
"im sure this is a great game if you like using a keyboard and mouse, but i dont. you cant map fire to the right trigger button on xbox controller, or change axis on preset. googled the problem and found that many people have complained about this for a long time now. if they cant be bothered to fix this then i cant be bothered buying the game.",1
"i love this game, has great mods to it as well. you will need a good graphics card to play it.",1
"i absolutly love this game though i have a bad pc and this game is very demanding (my pc runs at 10-30 fps with low settings) it is still very fun",2
"had the game since alpha. didnt really play much of it until my friend also got it. co-op mission is really fun, and since its all about custom mission, so its basically endless. the map is almost perfect, i love it! and the mods are great too. love the game really much. i think ill play it more often after i upgrade my pc though.",1
"played game for 150 hours. stopped playing for 2 weeks. relaunched game, joined server, walked 2 meters and global ban. 1/10 would not walk again.",2
"although i only played the free weekend my experience with the game (king of the hill and altis life) was pretty amazing. my only problem with it however is the battleroyale servers because they are always locked during a match which can take a longf time so to improve this i would make an area so players can wait for the match to finish. i was kind of sad about this because that was one of my main reasons to play arma 3 but i never had the chance. thanks to gassy mexican for showing the game on youtube (and making me play it)",1
"faceplanted and died whilst being shot at by a guy screaming hitler quotes at me. 10/10",1
"where are the crosshairs on this game? if there are any i must be getting unlucky and picking all the servers without them. i mean yeah ok graphics, but bad animation details, doesnt really feel like a shooter when you cant aim down the barrel of your gun, or even see your gun sometimes. the controls for this game are ridiculous, theres no need for all those controls, games not hard they just spent alot of their time putting useless stuff in it.",1

"arma 3 is a combat simulator, meaning that it is realistic and has great physics. the campaign is interesting and has enough combat and action so you dont get bored easily. there are many modes/mods to play on arma 3 like wasteland, altis life, domination, king of the hill, team deathmatch, etc. arma 3s editor is awesome and allows you to make simple bases, missions, or expirements or complex bases, missions, and expirements. the game is $60usd but is definitely worth buying if youre interested in games that include a sandbox, several gamemodes, and many ways to play. if you dont believe the game is worth buying, check out videos on youtube about several of the game modes in the game and decide off the gameplay you see.",4

"i played this game in alpha, spawn - airstrike - die - repeat, very unenjoyable. since playing the official release it has been great! i am now able to aim my sights at someone else, pull the trigger and they die, the vehicles are very entertaining aswell. thus making it an enjoyable game now. the campaign or champaign as i like to call it has some delicious variety of cypriut, english and american voice actors who truly went balls deep with their vocal skills. perhaps i should mention what the actual gameplay is like? no, its truly an experience only your hard earned cash can understand, i strongly urge you to consider spending some of your birthday money or stripper money on this simulation (game) and experience the story of a lifetime. you cannot possible fathom the scale of the maps that are at hand, it will litterally take you hours to run from one side to the other in real time. i highly recommend this game if you wish to waste countless hours of your life pretending to be in the military.",1
"this was my first arma game and it was amazing the controls are not hard but not the easiest this game is probly te best game i have ever played in gameplay but..... now it crashes to the point i cant play any multiplayer but other than that its amazing i think anyone who likes shooters and roleplay games should buy and play this game at least try it sometime",6

"i loved flashpoint for its realistic bullet behavior and so on, a real simulation rather than an ego shooter. but guys, u did improve nothing here, jsut graphics over alomst 2 decades now (previuos arma i +ii included), that is rediculous!!! all that boring scripts etc., maybe the game is good for multiplayer, but community is little, i think also due to all the hassle the gameplay comes along. u really have to improve on that!!! picking up equipment and else, also using from inventory is not state of the art. commanding own squad or trying to radio quickly... i better stop. thanks letting me play for free this weekend. one more time, single player campaign, there has to be another way then just those boring scripts.... keep working, maybe get rid of the old flashpoint stuff, new ideas bring new and hopefully better gameplay for the next arma.",1

"its arma, no doubt about that, all the previous features you would ever want are there. it is just unfortunate that the issues that plagued arma ii have not even been improved upon, let alone fixed. *edited july 2014* the variety and quality of the mods compared to arma ii is absolute rubbish, but hopefully that changes. the game desperately needs the ace mod too. it is essentially the good old broken as hell game that we all love",1

"first run and attempt join to any server ... game crash and back to desktop . ok no problem. second run and join to any server works fine. graphic amazing but ... sometimes strange artifacts where you can see object through walls. players in choppers sometimes are sitting in chair etc. on server without 3rd view when you switch view then for 30 seconds you screen is getting from black - maybe it was mod error. playing on servers with 64 can kill your cpu. same boring like arma2. nothing fun for bf players and im happy for free weekend so i will not spend money on this game. if you like spend 40min driving truck to aoi and die in 1sec ... this game is for you.",1

"life-like graphics and immersion would give any veteran ptsd. this game will turn anyone into a adrenaline junky instantly. the realistic gameplay and balistics are punishing, but at the same time very rewarding. this third installment of bohemias army simulator set in the near future on an existing island offers tactical gameplay and is enjoyed best playing in a squad. although lone wolfing can be done your survival chances will be smaller. the base game includes access to multiplayer mods like battle royal, wastelands, king of the hill, altis life and breaking point. high replayability value and a mission editor for those who like scripting all makes arma3 worth your money. requires a mid-high end pc to run properly. the gameplay can be slow. some mods dont run as well as others and suffer from desync. it has a few bugs and glitches, though nothing game breaking ive experienced so far. the movement can feel clunky and the controls/keybindings may take a while getting used to as there are just so many. i would reccomend arma3 to anyone who enjoys a serious militairy simulator.",1

"to be honest arma 3 alone is good but the community mods for it are really what makes the game come alive in the mil sim community! once you go arma you will never go back.",7
"this game is probably the least fun game ive played in a long time. it tries to sell itself as a military sim, but its as much a military sim as minecraft. wandering an empty island for hours until you get shot by some guy six miles away is not fun. also, 60 dollar price tag? games like red orchestra 2 are so much better than this and are much cheaper. youre money is better spent elsewhere.",1
"cant even explain how good this game is! love realistic shooters? theres no doubt you will like this. and if you dont, youre insane!",6

"love it. bohemia has really outdone themselves. the campaign grows constantley with each update. multiplayer is fun, with official servers and game modes, or mods to play, or even just some simple scenarios with friends. love the multiplayer, and is super easy to learn through the virtual reality simulator, and the virtual arsenal allows you to see how well you fight with what gun. loved it",2
"i have almost 600 hours on this game its one of my all time favorite war simulators out there mainly because of altis life and the so many other things you can do on it.",6
"its a very realistic simulator one of the best and with pretty grapics but with its price i would only recommend this game to people who will play it often",4
"its a great game for the player who likes realism, multiplayer, and sandbox games in one deal. by far the best military game ive played. 10/10",5
"pile of , biggest waste of money ever. it should be illegal to sell a game as broken as this for 45 mother ing euros. 5/5",1
"buy it on sale for $30 or less. game would be worth it in that case.",1
"i like this game, a lot...but im very concerned of why bohemia wants to keep adding stuff in this game instead of working on the optimization for multiplayer, i get about 40 fps in campaign on very high settings, but when i go into multiplayer...the fps bomb drops. ive tried working on the coding to boost the game but nothing works. i hope its fixed",1
"i want to recommend, and enjoy, this game, but i dont. because it is very buggy and feels poorly scripted. sometimes something as fundamental as interacting with the world, car doors, ammo crates etc. can be really awkward. this can abruptly lead to your untimely, poorly justified, demise. or if youre really unlucky youll lay around unconcious for 5 minutes prior to dying! :) i cant forgive the devs or the bugs in this game like a lot of people can. it has been this way since arma 1 - which i never played but understood it was unplayable. arma 2 which i did play and found unplayable. after two games, i find arma 3 to be barely playable. i figure by now they ought to know what they are doing and how to achieve a desired result. niche game. im sure theres a reason so many people love it. i honestly feel as though im not patient enough to both play a simulator game, and babysit the flaws of said game in order to get something out of it. i havent exactly got a hardon for military games like others do either so bare in mind that your phallus may differ. i would definitely change my review to recommend and play this game if it were just.. less buggy, more playable.. it really doesnt matter if you add gokarts or dragons at this point, just improve the game.",1
"its a good game,bohemia add more options to make the game not too hard to play,better then arma2,but the campaign doesnt work well,for example,at the last mission of survival,the artillery seems like random,so,sometimes i killed by the artillery,i dont think the leader said keep runing,so the artillery cant hit you is right lol :(,but its a really good game",2
"pretty sweet game, 10/10 would consistantly play again.",1
"i have played the two dlc single player survive and adapt and i found them very interesting and enjoyable to play. the first part survive is more an entry level to arma 3, where you encounter the basic situation of enemy engagement, moving in the wide open territory. hide from enemies. etc. the second part adapt is amazing and brilliant. some missions have intense firefight and they need careful planning, choosing the right position where to engage enemies. is more a guerrilla style of mission, such as the ofp resistance ones. but the gameplay now has really evolved to something reliable, realistic feeling, but also funny to play. i liked it. in the end i suggest to play the dlc campaign to all tactical gamers, who liked ghost recon series, or arma series, or maybe also ofp dragon rising sp campaign. especially arma 3 adapt dlc contains some missions really epic to play! i liked them a lot. cheers !",1
"really really great. i love it, but i always get so sidetracked than i cant freaking finish the campaign. mods are fun tho, and the missions are sometimes better.",1
"the most fun you will get from arma 3 is when you play with friends, even if non of your friends play arma 3 just go out there and make some friends.",3
"this military sandbox is definitely worth the buy! some game-modes i like are: king of the hill: a great team vs. team vs. team game-mode where you fight to stay in the objective area, level up to unlock more weapons, vehicles, and more! role-play game-mode (altis life, stratis life, arma 3 life, arma rpg) : a really fun mode where you can live your life as a civilian and choose a career, apple farming is good but you will make a bit more mooney running drugs. this game-mode offers great role-play experience that cant be beat. epoch mod: a great pvp/survival mod very similar to dayz, in this mod you can build your team, craft a base, fight off enemy ai, kill zombies, survive, scavenge. a great mod to play if you are a fan of dayz standalone, arma 2 epoch. overall a great game, and with 700 hours played i can highly suggest this game to anyone.",9
"so immersive when played in multiplayer with a proper team. map reading is just one of the real life skills you may need to use during battle, as well as using the radio and communicating with your team. also includes a great editor to make your own missions for multiplayer and singleplayer, and you can upload your own missions to the steam workshop",3
"the game is awesome, it has some very good servers like wasteland and altis life. also breaking point mod is very good, but you need to download it separately. weapons and vehicles are very nice to play with. however you need very.. very awesome gaming pc to run it on highest settings and if you can play 100 player altis life server on ultra settings with 60+ fps, thats quite an achievement, i mean damn. warning, dont buy this game if you plan to play it on a laptop or a computer that can barely run other big games. +very playable and good looking even with lowest settings +awesome servers and mods +sea, air, and land modern combat -sometimes it runs like a potato if you dont have expensive computer",5
"i cant believe i spent $60 on this. i thought i was getting a bad  game, turns out that its just bad and im the  for buying it. think operation flashpoint, just wonkier and more complicated.",1
"by far one of the best military games on the market. this has many improvements over a2, most importantly, many bugs were fixed and the game runs much better than a2 ever would have. something else id also like to point out is that the campaign in a3 is by far better than a2s and there is just so much to do. only thing id like to come down on a3 is the lack of vehicles, but im sure bohemia will come out with an a2: oa esque expansion soon enough and i am definetely looking forward to it.",5
"great game. some good mulitplayer mods avaible for it too. altis life is well worth a blast",2
"arma 3 is the best of its series. fantastic new look to the game, amazing single-player, just overall a great game. - 9/11 ign",1
"this game is so much fun! the multiplayer has such an active modding community that there is always something new to try! i have spent countless hours playing the arma series in general, well done bohemia! 10/10",3
"arma iii is a combat simulator. it creates an envioroment where you can perform and learn the basics of the movement of a military soldier. the campaign is really good, there is nothing wrong with it at all except from where i find it hard at some cases. but overall it holds a realistic simulation of how its like. i also love multiplayer on arma iii. people can transform co-op gamemodes to a realistic enviroment in multiplayer, like some people can form squads and they like to make it look like a real squad which contains planning, tatical, commands, things like that. it makes the game look real. arma iii was released 7 months ago but grows a better game each time. there are certain amount of bugs and glitches in it but its very rare the bugs or glitches occur.... the game is quite expensive i know, its 35.99 but its good to spend money on a brilliant game like this. if you want to spend more on it you can buy digital deluxe upgrade for 8.99. i recommend buying the deluxe edition for 39.99, make sure you like what you are buying of the deluxe edition. when you buy this game i hope you have alot of fun. thanks!",4
"a military simulator and the best one out there. no questions asked. you have a passion to play in huge conflicts with or against other people, use tanks, helicopters, airplanes, boats... then this is the game for you! note: for best experience, find a community to play with since public servers can have s in em.",5

"this game has terrible optimization.i am getting 15 fps in low graphics.",1
"this game is a nice roleplay game fun to play with friends too so it worth to buy this game!!",1
"pretty dissapointed. to me, it doesnt live up to arma or arma 2. the campaign so far hasnt done anything for me, very repetitive, not much variety & i dont understand why theres been a month between each part of it. id rather much go back to a/a2 campaigns and replay them. i feel theyve been lazy in the lack of content for the single player side of things, not introducing any single player missions themselves like in arma or a2 & relying purely on the community for that aspect. for me, as much as i like playing online (through 2 very barren wastelands) i do like a good campaign to work through first and single player missions. id much rather play through the operation flashpoint franchise (bar red river & dragon rising because they were terrible.) as in my point of view for a war simulator they are still very much un-beatable",1

"do yourself a favor and play the altis life servers for arma 3, become a drug dealer and flip off the cops at every chance you get...amazing!",2
"ratings: graphics: 9/10 sound: 9/10 content: 5/10 singleplayer: 7/10 multiplayer: 9/10 workshop: 10/10 diversity: 8/10 arma 3 is a great military simulation, that lets you feel how war could feel like. not seeing your enemy but getting shot at is almost everyday business, like it is if you are deployed in real life war zones. the game mechanics are far more advanced than in arma 2, however, the game still lacks content. although arma 2 didnt have content at the beginning, it still bothers myself a little bit. the sound and graphical elements are magnificient and the world offers a lot of nice landscapes. however i would recommend playing it as a multiplayer game, if you can try to play with some friends. i hope i could help you with my review. please note that this is my personal view, i will upgrade this review if further content is added lateron.",1
"fantastic game! really great graphics and a lot of fun if your into simulation shooters!",2
"this game is the best i mean i cant even explain it wow just wow i hope there is a part 4",1
"extremely fun game if you look for a troop to operate with. if you dont then its pretty much a waste of money. its a military simlulator, so it requires communication and a certain trust that no ones gonna shoot a rocket in the middle of the spawn base.",1
"waste of time. on regular difficulty even if you sneak near a soldier and shoot him 3 times in the head from ~2-5 meters with nato ammo, the guy will still turn around and shoot you. even if you can almost see the sweats on his forehead, you -a nato trained soldier with thousands of hours of training- cant kill anything from a 2m distance. great simulation! wait until this garbage costs about 10 euros, then it will be worth the effort. on the plus side: the maps are huge! too bad there are no birds and insects to see, at least that would be meaningful.",1
"full of vast scenery and realistic vehicles and weapons, arma 3 is a great open world tactical shooter. it is graphics hungry and even my 7970 struggles to run it well (although i havent taken to fine tuning the settings yet). the campaign was added after the release (which is weird) but its good and it helps the player in remembering the locations on the gigantic maps (like seriously stratis and altis are huge). combat is realistic (as far as i can tell), rp servers exist, coop is fluid, all in all a great game.",2
"i would recommend this game to anyone who wants to have diversity from being able to play a milsim to somebody who wants to mod the living daylights out it, there are many mods that subtle changes to the drastic changes like the dayz mod. i think it has the variety to be able to keep any player attracted the arma series for a long time.",2
"all my hours are on altislife and this game is so fun. you need to buy it",6
"this is really great game the graphics are sexy playing with your friends is mad banter yep what more do you want?",1
"arma 3 is a very nice game (in my opinion), because the gamplay and the graphic are beautiful. for more informations, you can click on my profile and look at the screenshots. it makes a lot of fun and if you like tactical shooters and have a computer with the necessary system requirements, i recommend you this game.",1
"this is great simullator, very fun and realistic. waiting can be long but there is an option to speed up time, which is great!",1
"game is great....very tactial would recommend.....but mp has low fps at the moment",2
"this is just to recommend others like me... this is in no way saying the game is horrible. i understand its not a casual shooter, but coming from battlefield to play this? i know what people may say about my review of the game, but holy ... movement mechanics by far are too complex... i typically expect to use only the minimum amount of keys to perform movements, but what the ... i am not going to count the plethera of those required to perform different movements, but its some kind of high  number. i played the campaign as far as i could take and halted completely when it came to flying the uav... i took me about 10 tries until i gave up and shouted obsenities at my tv... every time i tried i flew it into a rock, a house, myself, and even into the ocean... tldr: i dont have the patience to play this, nor the appetite to constantly learn how to bind keys. if you are a casual shooter kind of person stay the  away from this. trust me... im pretty good at battlefield, but just terrible at this. (two different games completely) i guess thats what makes this game unique. pros? its pretty beautiful though...",1
"i stoped playing other games like battlefield,cod ect after i started playing arma 3 best game real war game , what i really dont like in this game low fps on most of the servers more then 40 players on very high setting. its drop my fps even if u have very powerfull pc.... u wont able to get more then 25 to 30 fps on very high settings on multiplay server more then 4o player my system spics are processor i5 4670 (cooler master seidon 120 v) graphics gtx 660 4gb ram 500 gb 750watts power supply. i hope bohemia interactive will sort out this issue ...",8
"this is a really good game, i enjoy playing this game loads. the amount of gamemodes is great as theres loads of things to do and popular gamemodes such as wasteland can give you hours of fun. worth the money 100%",3
"this  so ing good cant stop playing thank you so much people who created this i hope everyone else likes it as much as i do",2
"best military shooter out imho nothing beats fire fights. i like how the game expects you to have a brain and figure things out by reading or training. practice really does make perfect in this game. sp is fun and the steam workshop co-op seems great. ive only done sp workshop missions and they range from huge blow  up missions to more of a mgs feel.",1
"the marksmen dlc has a bug with the new snipers, when you reload, it bugs out all movement and if u get in a vehicle and get back out you can move again, but you still need to reload, and it does this again and again, and im using the personal arsenal mod to test out loadouts. please fix this.",2
"its good if you have downs or any sort of mental impairment. takes ten years to get anywhere/do anything, lots of 12 year olds.... where is the bacon? i have not seen any type of strip or sauteed meal on a pan, especially one with a good seasoning such as garlic. it makes no sense how theres no laser beams. this game is just boring and awful. its nothing like the army, if anything, its snail simulator 2014. terrible game. gtfo",1
"1st time playing this i go on altis life with a friend, heres how it went: we spawned, bought a bag and a hat each, went picking apples for a few hours then bought a car each and went to do some delivery missions my friend crashed and i drove 18.5km to repair his car, only to find he was dead 2 paramedics came and revived him, i took the hat from my dead friends body first and offered it as payment the girl took the hat because the guy didnt like it and then accused me of being sexist because he wanted my hat he chased me around his ambulance for 10 minutes shouting give me the f***ing hat i dropped the hat, drove off only to see the ambulance over take me and get blown up by terrorists i then burned in the wreck trying to get my hat back 11/10",1
"multiplayer is really the best. you can have fun solo but the interaction with others in a fun and in a semi strict quasi-military group is where to be. lots of mods and new missions out there so there is no reason to get bored!! grab a rifle and march on..",6
"this is now my favorite game, congrats to bohemia interactive!",3
"to be honest like all previous bohemia games arma 3 is filled with all sorts of bugs and unfinished / half complete stuff , however there is something unique about this game , something special that keeps people playing this game .graphics , gameplay, campaign are pretty good even though they could be allot better. even though there are other military sims that are not bad at all , arma titles hold the very top . why, you may ask ? its because arma 3 provides the user with the tools to create whatever he wants. you finished the campaign ? no problem , here are hundreds of user created missions for you that you can now play. you dont like the missions ? no problem , here is the editor in which you can make ur own missions. you dont like the arma 3 factions/weapons/vehicles /visual fx/sound/ai/realism ? no problem , here , download the hundreds of mods available for free. you want to create ur own content ? here are the modding tools , you can do / create whatever you want with them. and this is what makes arma 3 special .i am sure bright future awaits this game if the devs listen to the community and the community stays loyal to this game.recommended.",5
"best simulation ever. as long as you have the machine to run it.",1
"great game would recomend that anyone who is anything should buy this game.",1
"great game. best thing to do is playing a3 overpoch and wasteland. the campaign is overall okay thoughi havent done all the missions yet cause of the high amount of multiplayer things to do.",3
"the most realistic military simulator ever made. i wish there were better and more animations for the infantry like running for cover, auto-jump obstacles, realistic animations for entering vehicles, more realistic damage,hit and destruction systems, for soldiers, vehicles and buildings. and of-course smarter ai. the campaign was also disappointing. i know its an mp game mainly but a solid campaign with many, many missions that keep the user busy for lots of hours + taking advantage of all the things the game has to offer is a big plus in my book. other than that... highly recommended military sim!!! well done bis!",2
"ive had this game for quite a long time but never really found what to do with it.,..until i found altis life! wow! its so much fun roleplaying as a civ trying to find his way on altis island. if you like roleplaying and are open to all sorts of avenues that appear in front of you, then this is definitely the game for you! top drawer!!",5
"i got a helicopter, crashed it into the middle of a group of enemies and killed them all. 10/10 would jihad again.",6
"i love the game. 7/10. but there is one thing you have to understand: multiplayer isnt like dayz or anything like that. you have to complete a mission. like co-op. i bought the game thinking it was like a war version of dayz. the campain is amazing. buy the game if you pick up on things easy. you kind of have to play the game for a while to understand alot of things.",2
"best game!!!! its got a lot fo improvement in it that than arma 2. but the main problem happens when u need to play battle royal the servers are always locked.",1
"i played this game for 260 hours and it was amazing. i played with friends and then got banned by battleye for no reason...i am very dissapointed in be for global banning me for no reason. i do not cheat and the worst i have done is download mods in which arma 3 has mod support. arma 3 is a overall great game but the sixty dollars is not worth it.",4
"if this game was a woman, i would pursue her until the end of the earth trying to touch her face with my unworthy hands.",1
"pros: arma 3 is a realilistic game with really good graphics and massaive maps that give the player the ability to decide how they are going to apporach their enemy. the multiplayer is really fun and their a ton of servers aswell, also modding is fun and easy with arma 3 and it comes with its own mission editor too. cons: the game is really difficult to play and will take anyone some time to get use to. arma 3 has a ton of controls that the player has to learn and commanding a squad in some missions can become a nightmare when your a.i. team mates decide to either not shoot at the enemy even after telling to open fire or running in front of something you told them to hide behind and getting shoot. i would recommend arma 3 for its realistic experence that i have only found in the arma series. you should check out arma 2 and day z standalone too.",3
"stepped on a mine at the end of a mission, after it said i completed said mission. at the start of the next one, i am immediately dead. thought i could make it work by replaying the previous mission, but no. still dead. cant continue the campaign. but other than that, pretty cool game. blisteringly difficult, most of the times you die, you will have no idea who shot you, or where it was coming from.",2
"it was a great game to play even with friends because there are somethings that you can mess around with in the game.",1
"if you have played arma series and you liked it, you are gonna love this! 8/10",1
"i downloaded the arma 3 demo (free weekend) to try and then removed it after the free period. now it doesnt show up in my steam library but it left behind 11gb of files which i have no idea if its safe to delete. theres certainly no option to delete them through steam as its not in my list of games. so i went to the arma 3 forum on steam to ask for advice and only people who own the game are allowed to post. seems like a very buggy game.",1
"this game is  over uses the cpu and ing crashes all the time dont ing buy this so much money for a not fun hogging cpu piece of !!",1
"arma iii in my opinion is a vast improvement over arma ii. theyve changed everything; making gun play much more well rounded, to smoothing out the driving mechanics. i enjoy the new equipment system, now instead of the old clunky backpack, you get a screen showing your character and two inventory slots (if youre looting a corpse, or picking something up) also if you remember the terrible main story of arma ii and operation arrowhead, then youll be satisfied to know that they did a complete 180 and actually tried with arma iii. i will say that i have some mixed feelings on how simplified arma iii feels compared to its predecessor, i do enjoy its easy to learn system, though i also feel a little put off by it as well. armas a game i play because of its somewhat complicated mechanics; if i wanted to play something simplified id go for battlefield or some other boring first person shooter. nevertheless this is a very well made game, and i urge you all to go and check it out.",1
"why can i write a review dont even have the game lol",1
"i got dayz sa... wasted over 500 hours! got arma3... drank tea with god for 50 hours!",1
"arma 3. one of the games that is just so hard to review because of the many different ways you can go about it. lets just say, i recommend it if you like 30 fps even with a mid to high end pcs. very heavy on cpu and not very well optimised, but its arma. what you get is huge maps. love it.",3
"honestly. i wouldve written a review on this game long ago but it took over my life. pros: awesome graphics (and sound) realistic huge modding community not too many trolls easy to pick up (although flying can take a little bit) great community altogether ive made many friends cons: some weird bugs hackers (although they are dealt with by in game admins usually quickly) i really cant think of much to put in cons altogether it is a very good game id give it a 9.5/10. the bugs in the game are the only thing keeping it from being a 10/10 stuff like falling off a 2 foot rock and recieving enough damage to die. other than that great game and would buy it again.",3
"fun game its best played with friends though however it does feel very realistic and it takes a bit to get used to if ur used to more close ranged fps",3
"after the steep learning curve its really good fun. beware, it seems very graphics intensive.",1
"love this game, although, good luck getting any kills :3",1
"a great well rounded military sim, a very good game has graphics of jesus juice, it looks and plays beutiful. on a decent pc it runs well on most servers. it has some great mods for it consisting of battle royale hamf and alot more. then other missions like wasteland a game where you can shoot muthaas and kill everything you see, then there is altis life, a role play game mode where you do drugs kill coppas and have an allout good time. i would greatly reccomend the game to avid mil sim players.",2
"this is a very involved game but a lot of fun very real gameplay and awesome physics",2
"an amazing games that will entertain you for a while, and the mods make the content on this game endless.",2
"easy to get lost in this world.... love the game and fantastic missions/ mods available",5
"this is one of the best games that i have ever played i hope you come and join the game its really fun. also the graphics and some more realism into the game from its previous arma 2.",4
"very good game and love it even more with the mods that i have put on it",1
"great graphics, realistic gameplay and i had a great experience with this game. much better than any other shooting games like : battlefield and call of duty. succesfully made me fat. ._. recomended 10/10 -datfpsplayer",6
"best shooter i have ever played, its not like other fps games, less arcade style and leans more towards realism but aside from that, the world of arma is just simple amazing and beautiful, very well made terrain and cities/towns, you can lose your self just wandering around.",1
"okay im going to keep this simple +graphics amazing imo + multi types of servers all fun from epoch to wasteland ect +amazing fun if you have friends and still fun on your own sneaking up on them and killing them all :0 +love the wep customization ect +prolly my most fav game on steam by far +never fully get bored of it all dlcs are 100% worth con but dont take these into consideration it still a great game -once in awhile you may notice a hacker -maybe the odd bugg but hay it dont ruin it completely",2
"i really dont like this game because there is not enough content. the content they have is not very good, and it seems like they are turning this game in to a dlc whoring game witch really sucks.",5
"this game is fun to play with friends on a server or download the communitys games and try them out. loads of different modes online you can play. but i recommend playing with friends its way more fun to screw around that way",1
"had firefight of epic proportions. died falling down stairs. 10/10",6
"i have been looking for a game like arma 3 since i started with shooters. i always thought call of duty, or battlefield 3/4 was the most simulated you could get without really going to war. this game is war. this simulator requires players to really try, it is not a run and gun game, you do that, you die. you need to be tactical, aware of your surrondings, and be prepared for anything, from a fireteam of men, to a sniper team, to tanks sitting on the hilll line. everything about this game is amazing. grapihc are awesome, if you can run them on normal or higher, the ai, and ragdolling could use some work. one con of this game is the ai, sometimes there smart, sometimes there dumb. they can get hit with a grenade at point blank range, break there legs, lay down and bandage, then get up and run away. over all, 20/10, would recommend to anyone who wants a good shooting simulator.",8
"epic game with awesome graphics. best arma multiplayer yet.",4
"good game...... exept i cant join any online match it kicks me or i have been banned and i have never used hacks so its a bit wird and thats why this game suck fix then start selling it as full version",3
"mechanics are improved though still has some bugs but what is arma series without those wtf moments",1
"great graphics, great multiplayer, and great community! what more is there to ask for?",7
"i purchased arma 3 only 10 minutes after being released on the steam store which was in its alpha stages, the game was extremely buggy & lacked vehicles / weapons.. however the game developers bohemia interactive have completely turned peoples opinions around now its finished beta stages & is fully released. i havent played arma 3 in a long time as im completely attached to counter strike global offensive, however you can just tell i know what im talking about when i say its an extremely fun game beats arma 2 / oa by far. dayz is a big no when it comes to arma 3. - as a badge collector i feel they should change the timing of drops as that is something the game lacks big time.. its extremely difficult to get even 1 drop in the game. - with this all being said arma 3 is a fantastic & fun game right now & ive just started downloading it again after my 600 hour gameplay.",6
"havnt even played vanilla arma 3 but the mod scene is great. would recommend to anyone.",3
"bohemia has again come out with a great military simulation product. however, the game does have glitches and is using what some consider as an outdated engine. the game is cpu intensive, and still provides vivid graphics and an in depth user experience. i would recomend the game to anyone that would like a challange. furthermore, the community for this game does a great job of providing mods which inhance features that bohemia may have missed or ignored. pros: great game, provides a level of difficulty not seen in other fps, requires teamwork, huge map, many... many.. many unit types and vehicles, huge community, beautiful graphics. cons: the game is too difficult for some, the engine seems bumpy at times and makes the multiplayer experience frustrating at times (this does not happen all to often however) i would give it an 8 / 10 or possibly a 9 / 10 (with mods)",1
"1st/3rd person military shooter with vehicle combat. one of a kind modern military shooter, with very large battlefields. a lot of clothing, armor, weapon variations, weapon modifications, ammo types, grenades, utility tools and different kind of equipment. large variety of civilian, military, armored ground and air vehicles. game has great modding tools and support. single player missions also included, as well as co-op and multiplayer modes. game has great visuals, texture quality, animations, environments and good voice acting. inventory is hard to navigate at first, and needs getting used to. you tend to die fast, and for some people it may be a challenge to stay alive. game supports large player count on any given map. personally i think this is good improvement over arma 2.",1
"awesome war simulator game! way better than arma 2 and the storyline is more flowing and interesting! you must get it!",1
"10.0 pros: -an insane amount of high quality, super fun, multiplayer mods -simulation style in all aspects -pretty graphics -super customizable from head to toe -once you grasp it, its ing awesome -breaking point (mod) -altis life rpg (mod) cons: -lots of controls to work with -not your average shooter; steep learning curve",1
"most def one of the best shooters i have ever played",2
"great game many hours of intense firefights and planning missions would recommend it to anyone, just have to remember that this is a mil sim not some normal fps,",8
"tried playing on win7 x64/intel celeron 1037u/4gb ram/hd graphics - 20-30 fps@800x600(everything low/turned off) and pemanent problems with the game ui and mouse - it starts working only after i switch the ui scale. multiplayer crashes (tried playing some rpg mode)",1

"terrible.!!! do not buy... just terrible..... has to many glitches!",1
"absolutely fantastic and never played before game. this game is a beast! i recommend this game with 9/10 stars",1
"best war simulator out there. needs a lot of polishing though! also it feels a little alien with all the futuristic weapons. would have been nice with present weapons. luckily there is a very active modding community that is very skilled. a most have game in my opionion.",8
"one of best experiences in multiplayer in my life. most of times i do mil-sim coop so this game is worth all money if you dont expect cod or bf like gameplay",3
"great game. graphics are amazing! you will spend days in this game.",1
"a nice upgrade from arma 2, people should also check out the breaking point mod.",1
"this is not you usual run and gun shooter. youve been warned. be expected to die and walk. a lot.",1
"you dont buy crack for sometime in the future just like you dont buy arma if you plan on going to work the next day...",4
"this game goes above and beyond. the way you play the game is completely up to you. if you want to be in a big  artillery piece than you can do it. if you wanna fly guns and provide close air support than you can do it. you can roll into a town in a big  tank and blow  up or you can kill a high-value target from over a mile away. its up to you. with a map of 270 square kilometers the playing field is huge. if you though battlefield maps were big, its time to put your big-boy pants on. arma 3 is by far the best shooter/milsim there is. buy it",4
"first of all, arma is not a shooter like cod or bf. the pace, style of gameplay, maps, are really different, but i have to say that it is more enjoyable, funny, and communicating with the other players is great. for example, being the gunner of a tank: there are numbers that tell you direction and distance, so other player inside the tank tells you the indications to shoot. you wont be able to find this anywhere else. or being in a squad, splitting in pairs to clear some buildings while the other 2 players cover you. it is important to make clear that you buy arma for its multiplayer and coop mode. if you are looking for campaign game, dont buy this. also, if you are planning to buy this game, i have to tell you that you will have to join a clan to enjoy this game to its maximum; otherwise, by yourself, you wont like it as much :s joining a clan means you will have to download mods (content created by the community), and probably teamspeak (program similar to skype) to play with them (all clans ask for a mic, take that into account). to sum it up, arma is a total unique in the experience out in the market regarding fps. nonetheless, to have a good time you need to join a clan and play with other people, and be willing to download new content.",3
"arma is such an amazing franchise, and arma 3 is no exeption. the game got over 40 weapons, but with different weapons for each faction, where two is very similar. in arma 2 there was alot of mods, like dayz or invasion 1944 but in arma 3 they added intigration with the steam workshop, which makes modding really easy. overall the game is amazing and definitly worth getting, and i would give it a 8/10 with the only downside being what i feel as too few weapons.",1
"i would say that the best way to describe arma iii would be to say that it sends you to war. be it through having your helicopter shot down in the first five minutes of you being in the game, and ejecting just in time to avoid death, then crawling to an outpost on your broken legs, to defend it to your death, or be it in having your humvee hit by an rpg and having your commanding officers head shot off by a sniper. the game is what you make it, but i will say this. this is not a casual game by any means. if you are a fan of games like cod or bf you will not be happy with this game. the hyper realism makes it often incredibly challenging to survive, but i can say from experience that when you do succeed, you will be as excited as ever. i would reccomend most players to start out playing online, because that is where most of the fun is. the multiplayer modes and the variety of them make a nearly infinite replay value. the games sandbox nature make it a blast to play with friends, though it does lose something when playing alone. i would reccomend playing with friends. i give it a 8/10.",2
"arma 3 is great war simulator besides some bugs / glitches you might encounter along the way, it is not like your usual shooter where you run and gun it requires patience and communication with your squad / team to be successful.",3
"its like 30 games in one. the mods and scenarios etc are amazing thanks to a great community!",3
"arma is a great game if you want a military simulator. until you die by a rock..... 10/10 would play again",5

"if you want a challenging game, with a great community and a stupidly fun editor then buy this game",1
"this game is amazing, even though it has some rather big optimization issues. i can deffinitely recommend it for something like the wasteland gamemode!",3

"this is a dayz ripoff game pls rate my review so i feel kool",2
"buggy as hell. they never fixed weird issues like being able to walk through walls. hard to tell when youve actually shot someone. no real visual indicator that youve shot someone, so you end up shooting them 5 times out of confusion. single player campaign seems badly thought out. i basically had to save scum to get off of the first island. ai is awful. no armory mode or quick mission mode. i regret buying this in alpha.",1
"the game by itself is amazing, great graphics and this is very well optimized. campaign is actually worth playing. much better than arma 2s and operation arrowheads. i absolutely love this game and with the steam workshop and other modifaction that can be made with the game like the extensions of the dayz mod from back in arma 2 such as: breaking point, overpoch, and epoch. this game just gets better every time you play or try something new. also the arma 3 altis life servers are cool, the life mod looks really nice and adds a lot of cool features too but i have yet to play it myself. on a scale of 1-10 i can easily rate this game and all its features a 9.5. probably one of the best if not the best purchase i have made on steam...",4
"i personally love this game, if you are into realistic first-third person shooters this is for you. i have played all of the armas and i believe this is the best one yet letting you scuba dive for a few missions, fly in the many aircrafts this game offers, and drive in tanks and other amazing vehichles. this game also has amazing graphics along with the sky actually changing its appearence randomly throughout missions to give it a more realistic effect.",1
"great simulation mechanics and awesome graphics fidelity.",2
"fun game to play with friends, huge maps. tons to do",4
"too difficult? its just too realistic. with the development both by bi studio and the arma community, the arma series is definity the most versatile military simulator for the moment. with great improvement in graphic quality and the ability to port arma and arma 2 into armaiii, arma iii has brought the arma series into a next level.",1
"dont get me wrong. i love arma 3. but the bootcamp update crippled the game for infantry. i know its supposed to be a milsim but honestly, i dont see how a trained soldier with a mainly plastic rifle, a few mags and the standard military garb cant run for more than 10 seconds without nearly dying of exhaustion. the ai apparently gains sustenance from the bullets you fire into their flesh and now take more than 6 shots to the chest to down, whereas your character will move like hes soiled himself if a bullet hits the wall 10m away. tl;dr: the editors good, the vehicles are responsive and fluid, but the stamina system is the worst one i have ever seen in a videogame. id recommend, but only if you prefer vehicle combat over infantry.",2

"i start wandering around the streets and suddenly, out of nowhere, a man walks up to me and tells me to get out of my truck. i do as he says and then the police walk up to me and ask me if i have seen the man. i say i did see him and that he stole my truck. the police officer thanks me, gets back in his truck, and drives away. now im without a car, and i figure the only thing to do is to go to the nearest atm and buy a quadbike so i can drive back to my house. before i got to the atm, however, i was stopped by a notibly drunk naked man who stole all of my money and took me hostage for a bank robbery. the man takes me to the bank and points a gun to my head, telling me that if i move he would shoot. the police pull up five minutes later and arrest the bank robber -- and me. i ask why i was arrested, and they told me i was accomplice in a bank robbery. i tried to explain my story to the officer, but he wouldnt listen. when i later got out of prison, i went straight to my house. i went to the top-floor of my house, boot up my computer and started playing arma. it was pretty fun.",1
"great game, massive improvement over arma 2, the editor mode is great because you can set up your own missions or just blow stuff up if you want. also there is a great modding communtity",3
"if you were a big fan of operation flashpoint back in the day and you think that the game has totally gotten derailed from where it was before - it actually is the same game with a lot of improvements and enhancements. i totally recommend this game to you if you enjoy tactical gameplay and military simulation. so far my favorite modification is the official arma iii zeus mod, which allows game masters to create their own missions on-the-fly, though they could add some more parameters for zeus servers (so the admin could disable game moderator totally - as sometimes youngsters join up and destroy everything). but so far so good. the game is very tactical and if youre into fast shooter games such as call of duty or battlefield - i really doubt this would be the ideal game for you unless you are willing to learn and see more. this game series goes in depth with the daily things they do in the military nowadays (or well, in the future, as this isnt exactly based on 2014 warfare). i love the game despite the fact that i havent played it too much; but as an old operation flashpoint veteran i would say that this is a great game.",2
"this game is awesomeballs. its so pretty and the guns work well too. on top of that, the landscapes are huge and pretty. the vehicles are probably its only issue since they sometimes feel like jelly.",1
"this game is super fun... if u really wanna have fun join the unitedatlis:altis life server. staff is really nice and they have a great team!",8
"okay im going to keep this simple +graphics amazing imo + multi types of servers all fun from epoch to wasteland ect +amazing fun if you have friends and still fun on your own sneaking up on them and killing them all :0 +love the wep customization ect +prolly my most fav game on steam by far +never fully get bored of it all dlcs are 100% worth con but dont take these into consideration it still a great game -once in awhile you may notice a hacker -maybe the odd bugg but hay it dont ruin it completely",2
"holy christ on a cracker. its amazing you have to get this game",2
"arma2 with some new weapon stances, granade shortcut keys and zeus live mission mode. definately worth getting with discount - would not recommend paying full price if u got arma ii already.",1

"cool game. good graphics. i run this better then a run arma 2.",1
"this game has even more potential than it has, this offers all kinds of modes for different types of players. arma 3 is the best shooting/interactive game in quite a long time. keep up the good work!",5

"coming from games like battlefield/counter-strike this was a nice change. theres a lot of little things to get used to, i.e. theres like 10 different stances all that can lean left/right. the ballistics are simulated and pretty well done aside from velocities of some guns. plenty of vehicles/aircraft to get the job done and offer a challenge, even though the flight models are still somewhat arcadeish/linear. the scale of the maps is just crazy, although everything kinda looks the same, its all laid out very believably. theres a few game modes for mp that are worth giving a try, mainly king of the hill/wasteland and i guess altis life but i havent tried it more than 10 minutes. one thing though, in mp games theres not much you can do fps wise when theres >60 players, you will get <25 fps in cities, it doesnt even matter how good your computer is. the sp campaign is good but the controls for ai still need a lot of work and more often than not they just die without following orders. the developers are constantly updating this game everyday with frequent patches so with that id give a rating of 8/10 at $60",4
"love this game and all of the gamemodes/mods if you dont own it buy it now your missing out",5
"this game is most buggy piece of  dialup trash, arma 2 has less glitches than this piece of , do not ing buy biggest waste of money and time",3

"besst game ever!!! i love bi provides the community with all the means to create custom content!",5
"i know there are a lot of nerds out there that seem to think that pressing 187 buttons just to take aim, is realistic. this is your game, not mine. cos this sucks so much balls, i think the devs would have no problem sucking a golfball through a gardenhose. it sucks more than a vietnamese  on xtc. it even sucks more than my dual stage vacuumpump. the flight model is appalling (im a pilot, try this  in anything that resembles a helicopter and they will be scraping your guts of the tarmac. the interface feels like a failed half life mod and reminds me of the days when i still had a 386 pc with 4mb of ram you have been warned. this is yet another game screwed up, most likely because of steampressure (get it?)",1

"arma 3 does a good job at improving many aspects that were lacking in their previous versions. most notably, in my opinion, is the ability to dive underwater without dying. helicopter flight dynamics seem to have improved, although they are still not realistic. i would like to see vortex ring state (now implemented with helo dlc, thanks!), limited power during hot/heavy/high altitude operations, and a wider ability to slingload realistic loads (partially implemented in helo dlc, thanks bi!) into battle.",2
"take arma 2, fix the bugs, give it some of the best graphics in gaming, and you get arma 3, once more modders get stuck into this game it will be a must have for sure.",1
"this game is awesome, to put it short. this game offers a unique and good war experience, its fun to play with your friends or just by yourself. the game also offers a huge varity in gameplay, both in the games content and the players content is a very vast collection of diffrent mission and gameplays. this game has alot of diffrent mods aswell, there is apperantly breaking point (dayz) in the collection now.",3
"the ai is still no help. its far away behind the group or is not able to hit targets... why cant this be fixed?! for mp only its very good but the campaign and ai sucks hard!",1
"1-10 because i purchased it. i bought it in alpha hoping that a full game would be released but it still has not. campaign is a joke, because there are player made campaigns that are 10x harder and more complex. multiplayer server hosting does not work 7 times out of 10. there is virtually no effort by bohemia to release content, it would be very easy for them to release all arma 2 content for arma 3, the community has done it but its damn straight  to get it to work and it barly does even when you get it too. there are virtually no weapons in the game. all the good features for arma 3 are made by the players. they have released less content than one dlc of anygame. just goes to show europoors dont make good games. 1-10 would not buy if on sale for 5$. asked bohemia for my money back and they do not respond and you are not allowed to post on their forums.  tier company is  tier. this is a huge disapointment from arma 2 content wise. anyone who gives a good review didnt play arma 2. or has the expectations of a cawadooty game.",6
"i found solitaire more fun 1. scopes dont zoom propely 2. multiplayer games are boring and have no point to them.. if you enjoy running around empty land gettin randomly shot by nothing and getting kicked out for no reason its great 3. no way to communicate with others in multiplayer and single player would be better if controls worked jus glad i did the free weekend and not wasted 30 bucks like i was going to",1
"put your hands up or die! altis life 35.8 hrs in the last two weeks and 175.7 hrs on record of me playing it. honestly one of the great comes to come out of steam and or bohemia. been playing this game non stop and cant get enough. king of the hill, co-op missions, single player, altis life, mods like breaking point, epoch, life, and many many more that you can play with just this one game. i definitely reccommend this game! check out my youtube for vids on arma 3",4
"great game. keep up the good work.strong community",3
"as good as it get for tactical simulation. hours of gameplay, so much fun!",1

"great game keeps me amused for hours. however slightly buggy here and there, but overall a great game!",6
"the best military sim game. the solo campaign is a bit different this time, with episodes. the first one is very good and shows us many new features. the editor, which can be complex or very intuitive, depending on what you want to do, promisses endless possibilites for the future. the ai was reworked, the gameplay is more or less the same as arma2, the graphic engine is wonderful if you have the machine to take it!",1
"this game is amazing. while the campaign is not what you should by the game for multiplayer modes are the greatest thing you can play. modes like wasteland and altis life are great. if you have to buy one game this should be it.",2
"ok, yes i would recommend this game but in the vanilla campaign you seem to be a revolutionary insurgent instead of a nato infantry soldier. sort of special forces .. ish but without the nato aspect. create your own missions or join an online group and its a lot more realistic. its a shame that if you want to download player-made missions or join a clan you will have to heavily mod your game which can be a headf**k. so forget all those childish cod games etc. and get this game. the best milsim out there at the moment.",2
"this game is a definite improvement over its predecessor, despite the optimization issues for those running lower level intel rigs or mid-high level amd rigs. even on low this game looks impressive and if you have an intel cpu (or high level amd cpu) & decent gpu (either brand) you should be able to run it on high where the visuals are sure to impress. the ai has improved over arma ii, though not tremendously, you will still have issues commanding your squad to do exactly what you want them to but theyre not quite as derpy. if you decide to get this game youre definitely going to have fun with it, i strongly reccommend to google custom optimisation settings and tinker with it until you have the most stable frames you can achieve. finally, the modding community for this game is excellent, there are plenty of great mods on the workshop and community sites like armaholic.",2
"its a good game way better then arma 2 and the bunys ohhh the bunnys they dont move 20000000000000km/s any more so perpare to shoot the little buggers. my first day on altis life got a car did some salt second day drove the car into a fence at 10 km/s blew up thrid day ran over a admin and got banned.",6
"arma 3 is one of the best games there is way better than bf4 and cod but at the moment the game is broken since the latest update and devs have no clue how to fix it so i would check forums to see if it is fixed before buying .when it works its a great game .",3
"good god, the realism in this milsim is just incredible! bullet drop, survival, and the ai is just great! arma 2 was good, but this, this is amazing! only thing is, the ui is a little hard to adjust to as i am a black ops 2 and bf3 and bf4 player as well. 99.7/100",1

"pros: -game play is extremely realistic -best shooter -massive multi player options -great for teamwork with friends cons: -only 24 hours in a day to play it :(",1
"i have played so much of this game and i can safely say that its good and bad. its good in the sense that the game functions how it should and sometimes the engine can just be hillariouse, however as a combat simulator it works dreams. if you play this game with your friends taking on ai it can be a blast. dig deeper into the communities though such as altis life (an rpg game mode) and you will find friendship, betrayal liers, honesty, some of the best and some of the worst people you will ever meet. i suppose this is a community review for this game and to sum it all up in one word i would use drama. brilliant game though",9
"arma 3 is a realistic military shooter that is part of the arma series (is it really?). the arma series has been around since 2001 and since then it has been improved greatly. arma 3 is a great game for people that are looking for a milsim (military simulation) game that has all aspects of war/military such as air (helicopter, jet, uav), infantry, armour (tank, aa, etc), water (boats, submarine). the arma series is known for having a really strong modding community, this is thanks to the support and the encouragment from the developers of the game. there arent really many problems with this game and the few problems that it does have dont really affect gameplay and if a bug is found the community generally makes it know really quickly helping the developers find the problem and fix it really quickly. with all the bugs getting fixed so quickly and the problems with the game being so small this leaves a great amount of time for the developers to add more to the game making it greater. overall this game is really fun and really intresting and you cant really run out of things to do with all the mods that are made for the game (epoch, a3 life and more). the arma series is also the origination of the dayz game.",2
"pros: -lots of vehicles -very very realistic -downloadable senarios -lots of controls (theres one to even salute and sit down) -a variety of weapons, it just so happens that 95% of the time i have a scar of some sort cons: -ai is terrible and dumb and slow! -shooting someone makes them to some kind of limbo back bending motion, looks really weird (whats up with that) -takes forever to get in the action on multiplayer co-op modes and i mean forever (really frustrating when you finially get on the ground then die or have a dumb pilot that crashes) -cant walk and switch weapons, like really? overall 50/50 but im going to recommend it beacuse a lot of people like it a lot more than i do so maybe youre one of those people",2

"as of the last update, my computer now bluescreens whenever i push the multiplayer button. it worked perfectly until the update. i can only assume that once again, bis has attempted to divide by zero, and then posted up the results for download - without bothing to see if anything actually worked. if you havent bought this game yet, understand that this is typical bis behavior. its one thing if the game crashes to desktop; its quite another when the negligent quality control proceedures cause an error that is potentially system damaging. as you might imagine, im not very amused.",3

"for the true infantry simulation experience the arma series for me is the only choice. ive been a player of these games since the release of the original operation flashpoint: cold war crisis back in june 2001. arma3 solidly builds on the pedigree built up by the previous games, retaining the essential feel of them whilst adding many new and much welcome features. the new highly customisable inventory is a great improvement allowing the adjustment of clothing, personal equipment and weapons and weapon accessories. some people may complain about the state of in game features like missions and the campaign at release but arma/ofp has always been more than just the game that was initially purchased to me. it is about what the game will become as bi and the modding community especially works its magic over the coming years. quite simply a pc classic which will hopefully continue to grow.",2

"do not buy this game, unless you are ready for constant 15 fps on multiplayer no matter what your graphic settings are. this game is really badly optimized and you will probably not get any better framerates unless you have a supercomputer. i get 15 fps with all my settings turned as low as possible and 14-15 fps when playing all maxed out. singleplayer works nicely tho.",1
"worst game ever i played whats this  graphics and  graphics engine ?????!!!! it eats graphics card without give u at least good graphics note : card is gtx 660 ti sc , ram 16 gb ram and p is core i7 3770 k laggy graphics ,low fps, high ping and high bandwith u need a super computer and 10 mb connection to play this at high graphics and u will still laggy go and see battlefield graphics or games which depend on havok engine how graphics is awesome at long range without any lagg att good pcs",1
"missleading requirements.... the minumun cpu is i5.. this game is garbage for amd cpus as well.. this game would had been amazing but the programmers of this game, game engine are noobs in their proffession.. its a stoneage technology.. seriously they should fire every programmers they have and recriut newly graduate... their employees need to go back to school.. you cannot call them professional anymore.. people with high end pc should boycot this so that we will be forcing them to freaking create app that can use of multicore cpus....",2
"i bought this game to be able to play it with a friend. i played operation flashpoint back in 2001 and was amazed, but i have never touched an operation flashpoint / arma game since then. i wasnt expecting too much. i would have never thought that it would become one of my favorite games ever. the gameplay is rather slow and very tactical compared to the battlefield series and shooters like call of duty. when playing multiplayer, you sometimes have to drive for 10 minutes, walk another 5 to get to your picked location and then slowly crawl up to your enemy - which sounds boring, but is very very exciting because you have to carefully plan your moves, predict what your enemy does and then strike. the graphics are very nice too, sometimes you just want to sit down and enjoy a sunset on the island but then the impressively accurate sound of a helicopter pulls you out of the paradise and reminds you that you are on a battlefield. i can highly recommend this game to everyone who is fed up with the always identical cods and battlefields.",2
"put simply, this is the only first person shooter that any self respecting gamer needs to buy. it has it all.",8
"spent the whole day after i bought this playing it, the wasteland mode is my favorite, all out pvp. highly recommend this game to anyone who like war games.",5
"its nice game becuse the graphics is fantastic! and the game for free !!!!..",1
"the overall experience you get from arma games is good. but bugs are to be expected. the game feels like an actual war simulator. one shot can either kill or hurt badly, medkits are must have and the missions are a fun experience. the game is reccomended when you have a couple of friends with you. it gets dull and boring if you are alone (like any other game) but with friends the whole satisfaction is improved.",1
"best game in my library, alot of people wont like this game cause it isnt easy like cod or battlefield, well they need to learn what strategy is and skill and simulation. because this is top of the line!",2
"buggy as all other bohemian games, also very resourse consuming. however, you can have a good time once you figure all the things out.",1
"fun game with fun gamemodes what i dont like is the random amount of rock walls offroad 8/10",2
"great game, it has amazing greats, brilliant realism, awesome playability.... problem though.... the community. as with any online game there are always people there to cuss or spam music and with no rap or vote procedure to kick such people off you are forced to join another server. it seems there will never be a screening process to keep scumbag trolls away from team based online games such as arma 3. all in all... good buy and i recommend it to anyone wanting an indepth war simulation.",1
"this is what a real simulator should be like. not goats running into cars.",1
"superb game. needs a beefy computer but will run full 60 fps on ultra on my pc. specs: intel i3-3220, evga geforce gtx 750 ti ftw, 8gb ram clocked @1600mhz, 2 tb wd hdd, 500 gb wd hdd, 750 watt psu",2
"i liked this game.. until battleeye gave me a global ban just because i used cheatengine to change a number in single player for giving me equipment. that result is a global ban. is this fair? i do not think so.",2
"absolutley amazing some bugs but they arent noticable u may need a decent computer/laptop 2 run it comes with a sandbox editor mode fun as",2
"a really enjoyable improvement from previous arma/flashpoint games. dont buy this unless youre fine with spending a lot of time running around a huge island, zeroing sights and looking at your map.",2
"its a bit buggy and glitchy, but an overall fun experience if you like military simulators",1
"one of my favorite games, it has more realism than any other fps out on the market. yes the physics can be a bit ed but as for actual gunplay and the things that matter are great. arma 2 is the reason i joined the master race lol",5
"great game even though it still has some issues on altis but i definetly recommend it, its worth every penny",2
"good game recomend it to people like my self and others who like virtul reality game,fighting,action and rpg love it great job bohemiea thanks again good job",1
"after playing shooters for a while, i have never experienced anything like arma. the whole series offers intense gameplay, and i surely could not be the only one to say, after a gun fight, you will be shaking with adrenaline and excitement. if youve played dayz (which has the same engine, practically the same game but with zombies) then youd know this experience pretty well. i recommend this to anyone!",1

"arma 3 is an expansive military simulator that excels beyond any game i can think of off the top of my head in both realism and graphics. as a pc gamer it is practically a requirement to get this game (assuming you like fps). it is really fun and is potentially a mix of an fps, rpg and military simulator (with sandbox!) the steam workshop adds tons more content as well such as missions, racing mods, and pretty much anything you can think of...",1
"great game, theyve improved the singleplayer and the engine alot since arma 2. and the multiplayer is ofc 1st class with friends!",1
"and were running, and were running, and were running, and were running. running. walking. running some more. a little more running. alot more running. is good track simulator. strong, like bear.",1
"was real turned around when i first got into the game but with finding the editor my eyes are clear and i see the game for the limitless potential it has.",2
"its a really good game but i wish it was a bit cheaper",1
"would definitely recommend this game. this is a fantastic game, just as its predecessors were. a fair bit of content and tons of different game modes to play on, expect more to come in the future. the ai can really rip you apart in this one and arent as easily tricked like in arma 2. pick up the game, you wont regret it.",2
"this game is so fun but i need more to play with so come on get it as it is mad to play",1
"if youre getting this because you enjoyed arma 2, then its nothing like it. better graphics, but i feel left down. 7.8 / 10",1
"the best game i have ever played. sadly a lot of people will never get to try how amazing arma 3 and roleplaying on altis life servers is. its so different from other games and i love it.",6
"if this game is anywhere near what realism actually defines itself as. then the game is 100% spot on. too many times have i walked into rocks to be flown 20 meters to the side in real life, and im glad the game emulates this.",6

"a definite upgrade from arma ii, the controls act more like pc controls of the 21st century (not feeling like your wading through pudding when trying to look, strafe, etc.) and the graphics of course are much improved. there have been some issues with physx crashes, but only from those with amd cards in my experience. sa-matra wasteland alone is reason enough to pick this up! the only gripe i really have is that they still have not made the client/server multi-threaded. one of the most idiotic things to overlook when the ai calculations and such really make this game/engine heavily cpu-intensive. if you love realistic shooters without all the kill-streak b.s. and handicapping, pick this game up.",6
"arma 3 so far is basically arma 2 except buggier, prettier, worse, ran better, and with less mods. its... a confusing cocktail of less 2 steps back 1 step forward, and more 2 steps to the left, 4 forward, and then a crip walk in a circle. it has all of the makings of an excellent game i just hope that the success of dayz has left them with enough staff to worry about fixing this game up like they did with arma 2.",1

"true battle simulator 2014 when you want it to be, but also a hint of rpg. obviously by a hint i mean the ~1000 altis life servers running right now. love this game, its my most played game. king of the hill, battle-royale, wasteland, breaking point, and countless life type servers make this a great game for programmers and players. worth the $60 i didnt spend for it. *cough* bought it *cough* reatil. *cough*",3

"all i can say is this game is awsome! the ai for squad command might be off but multiplayer co-op like invade and annex is just like being in a real life war. only down side to this game i can find is the ai for squad command. they dont really follow your orders well at all.",1
"amazing game. yeah sure, there are some bugs, but that is like any other game. amazing mp and sp scenarios and editors. i would highly recommend getting this!",2
"it was the best of games, it was the worst of games.",2
"arma 3 is a great millatry simulator it is very in depth and i had a lot of fun with this game! one of the things that was a buying point for me was altis life it is a gamemode like cops and roobers where you can do anything from smugle drugs acrros the border to stealing cars or robbing the bank! however the main point that i like the most is how you can acoplish your objective in your own way for the campaign and the multiplayer, you want to go in head first guns balzing you can, you want to go with a stealty helicpoter insercion and some sniper support you can. this is hands down one of the best millitary simulators, and i strongly recomend this game!",5

"arma 3 is by far the most realistic, most entertaining, and most intence war simulator of all time! if the technology is availible this game should come out for next gen. consoles. not only is this an amazing sandbox but it also blows every other war game out of the water! keep up the good work bohemia interactive, and step aside battlefield and cod because a new age has started. the age of a real war.",3
"if you play call of duty or battlefield often, this may seem unapealing. but i dont that much so, yay! i love arma 3 life, battle royale, and tons more. i highly reccomend this game.",1
"the game mwas fun to p[lay it runs perfict on ultra or low grapichs and i think everyone should get it when you have a chance",1
"various gamemodes to play! very fun. try altis life as being a cop! hahah its soo fun! i love it",2
"arma 2 - failed college and became obese. arma 3 - failed my life.",1
"really good game lots of cool fetures i think that if i play this to mutch it will get to a point to where i wont stop i recemend you buy it i like it",1
"great game, i wont say this is the best game but the best thing of the game is modification. even though the sound is bad, not that much vehicles and the functions is not enough, still you could use mods like jsrs, vehicles addons and scripts to increase your gaming experience. single-player gameplay isnt the best but multiplayer is the main point of the game. play around with friends or even build your own clan, it has great features to enrich the multiplayer game experience. every game has great points but also bad points, it does on arma 3 too. for much modifications and these beautiful graphic, 32bits game engine is clearly not enough. its sad that even you have a well built computer, it still have a  fps and much lags. biohemia has said that 64bit game engine will be avilable someday later, hope it does happen before arma 4 release. game rate: 7/10 (minecraft: 9.5/10)",6
"awesome game has lots to offer for players with experience but also for content creators",1
"if you love milsim this is the alpha male of that category!!! enjoy and check out my youtube",2
"the multiplayer is fun, but has a lot of performance issues. i wouldnt recommend it full price, but if it is at a 50% discount, buy it!",1
"in a world of call of battleduties, arma 3 is a welcome breath of fresh air. as a former infantryman, no other game makes me feel quite at home like the arma series. ive been a fan since op flashpoint and arma 3 is an excellent continuation of an excellent series. my only issue comes with bohemias seeming lack of research into actual uniforms and equipment, but other than that, the arma series is fantastic. also, the modding community is fantastic. you do yourself a disservice in not getting this game.",3
"do not compare this game to battlefield or call of duty. its a slow paced, tactical shooter that requires teamwork. not for the impatient or lone wolf. excellent community and nowhere else have i been able to work with 40+ people efficiently and effectively on an objective in a video game. lots of fun.",1
"this is a great team-playing game if you find the right server. 10/10",4
"splendid idealogy but could use some, how can i say, advancement, the combat doesnt feel so perfect as in cs:go but it does compete with insurgency. eh id rate is 8/10 recommended if you got friends to play with, 6.5/10 without friends.",1
"love this game, its that editor that completel ykicks butt, you can design any mssion you can think of. like its unlimited gameplay potential. its only hindered by your own creativity.",2
"meh, its good. allows for some fun on gamemodes such as king of the hill and wasteland. but, arma 2 for life.",3
"a great game that when i went to buy the sale went off",1
"it looks sweet, runs good but the controller layout is all over the place and you cant change it :/",1
"there we sat, a small squad of eight men. all ready for the order from our captain. then a voice could be heard. it was another man screaming. then gunshots, then silence. our squad leader told us to move up into a defensive position and lay wait in ambush for the convoy to come along. so we did, then we heard a ton of gunshots. yet we still waited. then we heard women screaming, then children. we knew the gunshots were akms and we thought they were in a firefight with civillians in the middle. then the trucks came. truck after truck, i counted 7. everyone in my squad just stared. then i noticed the others were standing up. i stood up too in case i was missing something. then i heard a whistle and the commander exploded, same with his second-in-command. i ran away, and never saw my squad again. i hope you like my story of a somewhat realistic interpration of the game. this is a really good game. no doubt, but i dont think i like the semi-futuristic time period in the game. i would have preferred something in the more near future. in the end thought its an awesome game, and once you finish the campaign, you can spend countless hours playing multiplayer. and if you get bored of that you can enjoy the power of full steam workshop integration and download other peoples scenarios!",1
"one of the best shooters being released this year.",4
"too much like arma 2, except arma 2 mods are way better.",1
"this game floored me. then i fell throught the floor into hell and i was like dang thats one hell of a game.",1
"just purchased arma3 on the 50% of sale. i have to say i am a huge arma2 fan, but i was blown sky high when i started playing arma3. the reviews somehow just did not do it justice for a big arma2 fan. i actually did not know if it was that much different form arma2. i was so wrong. arma3 is better in every way so far. weapons, graphics, sound, player interaction, ui menus, etc. etc. i have only had it for one day now, and it is by far my best pc purchase in a long time. also, i have bought into all of the survival games on ea to which even though i am happy to support the games i chose to support, none of them have become fun to play for me. i like dayz mod and let me tell you breaking point for arma3 is the answer! you get a zombie game plus all those vehicles and weapons! the epoch servers are also so much fun in arma3, vehicles everywhere on some of them, planes, helis, tanks...etc. so much fun. good job bohemia interactive and good job to all the modders out there!",3
"with this you can have fun !!!! ( altis life rpg ) if you want to be serious then you can have even more fun :) altis life rpg to be honest it took me a little while to adjust from playing arma 2 to arma 3 but once you have found your footing youll be a right happy chappy :) at this time the game is on a free weekend so i recommend that you try it .",2
"i love arma 3 and it is the best game i have played in a long long long time",1
"a very good game, extraudinary graphics, the best game if your looking for a game with a large community and a lot of variation, many different gamemodes such as epoch which has an amazing community and many servers, or maybe battle royal which is the perfect game for adrenaline when your running throught the forest hoping not to get killed, but anyway, now we come onto the bad parts: its rather expensive for what you get, they charge you for the actuall game but when your in a server and then u feel the relief of finding some kind of rare vehicle such as a helicopter, you find out you cant enter the vehicle because you need to spend more money on all the dlcs, when i found this out i just thought the game lost its touch. but its still an amazing game with great graphics, i also found that if you play it on your own or you like to play games solo you dont live the game up to the full potential, when i first logged in i instantly knew this was a game for co-operative play with friends where stratagy is the key but in the end, this is just my opinion of the game, i hope this has helped everyone who is thinking about buying this game and if you do, happy huntin boys :d",1
"dont join german servers. they will arrest you for ing looking suspiceous. other than that, 10/10",2
"good game, great community, awesome graphics. loads of oppertunity and addons. 10/10",1
"youre sitting here reading this when you could be playing it. what are you doing. hit that buy button bro. do it. why are you still reading cmon man buy the game. i dont got all day if you really scrolled down wtf. nope. such comments much caps very arma wow buy it.",1
"initially, i bought this game because i wanted to play wasteland or something coming from arma 2. this was back in alpha. it sucked , and i left the game to collect dust for a long time, then one day when it finally got released, a whole new gaming experience overwhelmed me! completely swept me off my feet with the mechanics that this game has to offer, and due to one of the latest updates being zeus it has made gaming to a whole new level. since becomming a fan of the arma 3 i now own 2 servers for a community named stdelta. its the most fun you could have with a war simulator you could ever have your hands on. would definately reccomend this game to any gamers looking for a challenge in their gaming. live long and drop the the floor and do the dinosaur. ~hash",6
"i think this is the best pc game. honestly, there are so many mods. from wasteland, to breaking point, to, epoch/overpoch, to altis life, arma 3 life, battle royale, military simulation, and so much more. trust me, it is well worth your 60 dollars and will keep you entertained for a very long time. if you can get past the horrible optimisation, and get by with whatever fps you get trust me this game will keep you entertained. 10/10 would play again.",2
"highly recomend this game to anyone who wants to buy it as there is no game crashing bugs, lots of fun in battle royal and for people who like a mixture of guns and drugs scareface style should really play altis life rpg.",1
"i spent 600+ hours fapping to this game, money well spent! seriously though, buy it!",7
"arma 3 is the deciscive military sim for the hardcore military gamer. with excellecnt graphics and fun gameplay for hardcore fans, the 3rd iteration of arma is a huge step in the right direction. however, the game suffers from poor optimization and bad ai. however, with a decent enough pc, any gamer can play. the ai however, cannot be fixed by a simple computer. they sit and dont attack, zig and zag instead of dive for cover. overall however, i would give it a solid 7.5/10.",3
"this game is action-packed, but filled with humorous moments. great for anyone who likes simulations, fps, and strategy.",3
"the multiplayer in this game is amazing you can do almost anything. could use a bigger variety of guns.",3
"outstanding game a few bugs but overall great 4 stars",7
"drove a car over chicken wire. car broke. 10/10 would drive over chicken wire again",4
"i personally think that this is a love or hate kind of a game, and i hate it, more specifically how it controls. yeah it looks great but if i cant enjoy the way the character behaves i wont enjoy the game. its just too clumsy in my opinion. if you dont like arma 2 then you wont like this one.",1
"bought the game excited to play it. didnt start up. tried different ways to start up, then without steam, still didnt start up. looked to get some help, did the -nobenchmark tip. the game started. played a couple hours, got off went to bed. got up, tried to run the game, doesnt start up again. even with the -nobenchmark, and different combonations of starting the game.",1
"this game is very fun and open and alot of things to do. the singleplayer is very amazing with the stunning graphics and visuals. the audio is somewhat clear, but i can understand people clearly in chat and i can hear gunshots and explosions from a long distances and it is very cool. the multiplayer side is amazing and playing from the combat simulation with others to the altis life rpg addon and to the epic zombie survival mod of dayz to surviving and fighting in the world of wasteland. last but not least, the editor for arma 3 is very good, but very advanced to understand right away, just get used to the basic things of editing until you can create large scale battles with the editor. this game is not for the regular fps players, this game is way more intense in my opinion than call of duty or battlefield. you actually have to plan and use tactics to get the job done and the maps are very large and you cant run forever. so at first it might be irritating for new players, but you will get used to it. very fun military simulator and it is very addicting. this game is a thumbs up! :d 12/10",2
"i do not recommend this game unless you have dedicated friends to play with. i would wait for gta5",1
"very entertaining but has some problems such as some of the worst optimization and lack of content that they try to sell to us in dlc but is overall a good game",3
"one of the best fps shooters out there, you will love this especially if you love military simulators. think americas army 3 but on a planetside 2 scale multiplied by 5. the game requires quite the powerhouse of a computer though mostly due to the scale and insane level of detail. deffinitly take a look into this!",1
"fun fun fun...boom shot leg is broken...8/10 would play altis life again",3
"amazing game but terrible at the same time i played a good 210hrs of the game just to get on the next day and see i was banned i tried contacting them and they did nothing but i researched it and i dont have it the worst people have played for 5hrs and been banned for nothing dont recommend this game at all.",3
"i have a lot of fun with this game but with heli dlc the ed up totally flying with heli and its now impossible to do so better dont buy this game its",6
"the best massively open world first and third person shooter i have every played. arma 3 makes call of duty advanced warfare and battle field 4 look likes child play. the amount of detail in all there helicopters, tanks, troop transports, characters, weapons, maps, lighting, effects, go-carts is overwhelming! sometimes when im flying over a city getting ready to para-drop into a hell fire of tanks and jets, i feel like im watching a hd action movie of the year! i dont what i love most about this game the most, might be laying in the grass on a hill a mile away from any conflict staring down my scope of my rifle calculating the wind and the bullet drop, then taking the shot. no game has every made me feel so rewarded when i complete a mission. amra 3 missions are not these 5 minute deathmatches there long fought out high action battles. also there map is so big its insane, and its not just one island, theres others that are insanely big, i cant even imagine how long it would take to go from one side of the main island to the other flying in a helicopter going over 200+ miles per hour. lastly very unique complex non-repetitive terrain. love it, care for it, buy it!",3
"i love the mulitplayer you will have a blast trust me bros..",1
"ten times better the arma 2s story to much altis life servers but still a very good game 8/10",1
"playing gamemode wasteland: spawned in bought a gun killed everyone at the gun store ran to the water drowned respawned ran across the whole map to get to a money shipment 5 other guys were there i hid behind a rock hey killed all the ai and then i killed them took the 75k ran across the whole map to an atm deposited it blew up a chopper with a minigun boat then i left 1010 would do it again! gg",1
"coming from the guys who made arma 2 and became well known because of the dayz mod, you could expect another dads game with guns and realism... it has dlcs and all the stuff that the cool kids have these days. tenouttaten/10",1
"really do what this game so bad it is so good and worth it",1
"one of the best fps games ive played by far recommend to anyone",1
"first impression - nice graphs, what i mean it is epic nice, on the other hand, hard to get familiar with inventory, selection stuff, but all in all it is worth price. ....so only few words about this awsome goodness. way better than arma2, if you think your computer cant handle this game. trust me it can, even if arma2 were lagging for you. :)",4
"im loving it, and the mods make this game incredibly addicting and also gives it more replay value than any other game. best game for multiplay on the pc in my opinion.",7
"a man in underwear crashed a quadbike into me. 10/10",3
"a great game, fun to play with friends. honestly, i feel a bit ripped off by the lack of content provided by the developers, and the gameplay seems aimed at entertaining the call of duty/battlefield fps crowd. they continue to update it with new content, but it just doesnt hold my interest very long. not to mention the many unrealistic features they added in to make it combat seem more fluid and fast if you are overflowing with $$$, and you feel like buying it, go ahead. i would not recommend buying it just yet.",2
"cannot invert y axis for controller. there is an option to customize, but you will have to remap the entire scheme because there are missing/double binds. im too old and set in my ways to change my ingrained play style for one game. pulling back on the stick to look up is reflex for me.",1
"this is good, i like it, it lacks some basic things like female character models and some articulation of the current models, but its a vast improvement. the big problem though. i have liked the arma series for a while so i got this in early alpha. now, my friends want to play it but $50? did bohemia sell out or something? it doesnt even feel fully finished yet.",2
"arma 3 hits the spot nicely, loving the co-op missions.",10
"i played this game on a free weekend. on the first mission i got hurt, aplied a medic kit to myself, but then the soldier wont go faster than 1 km/h. anyone, who likes moving turtle speed over endless terrain - welcome to join this ing masterpiece.",1
"now when the game finally has gotten some improvements to the framerate... its still just playable. anyone that thinks his got a bad computer should not buy this game. it will need the best pc components out there to even get near 60fps. poorly optimised game, but once you found the settings that works with your computer it can be a fun game. but still the slow movement, stopping while changing weapon is a deal breaker. im dissapointed that they didnt learn anything from arma 2. what i think about the game 1 is worst 5 is best graphics = 5 gameplay = 3 sound = 2 optimised = -3 playable? sure when you got the best pc there is to buy and nothing better to do.",1
"arma 3, and absolute major achivement by bohemia interactive! i am glad to say that this game has been my favourite game for quite some time and i strongly advise you to purchase this product if you havet already. buying the digital deluxe edition of this game gave me all the arma 3 game music which i thought was pretty cool considering the music is high def.",3
"awesome game! the best part of the game is altis life. its really cool and its defindetly worth the price.",3
"this game is really fun, and has so much mods you can play. i really reccommend this game. but there is one down part to it... its addicting!",1
"l love this game but the problem is l cant spot the emeny also how to aim but any way l love the game ><",1
"great game! some of the best realistic gunplay and combat. the base game is good, but its the multiplayer that shines. things like altis life and battle royale will have you hooked.",1
"this is real live military battlefield. this is not arcade fps game. (ex - call of duty , battlefield) this is full real simulation training game. but... no jump support... :d",1
"fantastic game 9/10. visuals are amazing on any setting above medium. style of gameplay is completely up to you. replayability is infinite. audio is brilliant. the only downfall is the ai (if you have no mods on), the settings for their skill levels needs a bit of refining. its either theyre as dumb as a stump or so smart that they drop you before you can even get ready. definitely recommend.",5
"absolutely amazing gameplay,graphics and lighting are superb. glitches are never gamebreaking though happen very often in game modes such as atlis life and epoch mod. but is a great game,buy it! (8/10)",1
"action packed, you can do almost anything imaginable with this game, immersive campaign, the introduction of steam workshop really added to the amount of fun you can have with this game. i personally prefer the rpg (altis life) or sandbox servers. 9.5/10",2
"amazing game.good graphics life is fun, the domination is epic and i would higly recomend it. if you get it play some easteland with me on atlis (the biggest map on arma 3 which is 1/4 bigger than chenarus.",2
"i wouldve gotten more enjoyment out of burning the 25 than by buying this buggy, laggy, always-35-fps-max-no-matter-if-settings-are-on-low-or-on-ultra, looking like crap piece of .",1
"the best thing about arma 3 is the open ended content you can play on it, and you can get on a server with 10+ of your friends and play together against the computer or other people. the game has its glitches (network blips) that can be mitigated by going to a strong server host / game type and making sure you are close to it geographically. this is because the game world is huge, and you can see multiple kilometers away enemies running around and can snipe them from a distance or rocket their vehicle. i am glad that dayz got me interested in the arma series as i have had a blast with them so far.",3
"one of the best games i have ever played! some glitches but they will get ironed out after the developers spend there spoils and feel like being productive for more money... if you liked arma 2 you will love this.",5
"a nice simulator. unlike other games that try to give a warfare experience but instead give you a stupid cqc stage, in this game, it is do or die, you must team up, but you can give it a try to being solo, of course, it will not be like call of duty or medal of honor, it will be... an unique close-to-real warfare experience. the game has few guns, but they are unique and can make a difference. the variants are extended, making it a huge library of choices you can have. the bullets have an unique rendering, and you can have tracers (red, green.), which can be seen and can help to tell a nearby teammate where the enemy is. the vehicles are decent, most are sluggish and it does not really give you a civillian feeling, but it gives out most of the military feeling. many servers to play in, with different modes: altis life, co-op, zeus and so on. you can find a game mode you want, and with the huge quantity of modifications existing around steam and the internet, you will certainly never stop playing, unless tactics or marksmanship isnt your thing. 9.5/10",2
"great game with infinite possibilites due to a sandbox world, if you plan on buying this game, you should also consider getting a high end cpu if you want to play on large multiplayer server.",2
"are you looking for a milsim game that uses cooperation, tactics and all out warfare well  off this isnt the game you are looking for. you will be killed by the smallest graze to your arm and if you just so happen to live from your wound you will have the worst weapon sway that the universe has ever seen. the planes are ed up to a point where a pawnee will shoot you down by following you and random spraying its miniguns that have the power of the sun and dont even get me started on the physics oh jeez you can get shot in the foot and die and from the shear impact your body will fly to the ing clouds and back . oh another thing if you so happen to be driving a car and hit a little mesh fence designed to keep rabbits out you will lose you engine, tires, hull and virginity to that mother ing mesh fence and thats only going 15kmh dont even dare go over that speed limit you daredevils. ahhh the best of them all... the stamina update... you can be running for 50 meters and your guy will be having cramps and dying from pure exhaustion from the marathon that er just ran so calm your  son and walk that off while under fire from all them ers out there with little 9mm rounds that will behead you. good day and do not buy this... ever... at all..... i mean it",10
"from what i can gather, its almost exactly like being in the real army as a proper soldier. even guys that are actually real soldiers are saying this on the internet in forums and what have you. i guess they do this when they get back from a patrol or something and then start playing arma 3 and theyre like hang on,this is supposed to be my layabout time, why am i putting myself through all of this again? and on my own dime to boot! anyway, infinity ward have created another scorcher with this one.",1
"i have just bought the game installed it opened the game and was global banned for no reason terribal game",1
"i love this game! ive been playing multiplayer a lot there past couple of days. if you are looking for a real military simulator this is the game for you. when you find players that will join a group with you and take the game seriously it is tons of fun. this is nothing like call of duty or even battlefield. i would recommend this game.",1
"best of its kind! still a bit buggy but great fun and everything is possible! :d",3
"arma 3 takes it a step further with then its predecessor with enhanced ai, gripping storyline and immersive campaign. the campaign is split into 3 parts, each released seperately. this keeps you on hold slightly but its worth the wait. also the multiplayer with the use of mcc sandbox is great fun.",6
"this game is worth getting 10/10 from me. very detailed, and very realistic!",5
"this game is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo eipc make more update best game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",6
"the best game to get really fun to play 10 out of 10",2
"amazing game, altis life is the best. just dont get caught farming weed on a mountainside.",1
"this game is amazing! so fun and unlike any other game. i highly recommend purchasing it, well worth 60 dollars.",1
"much improved over arma ii. loads of downloadable content especially for multiplayer/co-op. the ai is smart enough so that each scenario is not exactly the same every time. on the down side, development seems to be a bit slow. there are still some glitches, and patches arent released regularlly. some of the keystrokes take some getting used to. if you are using mouse/keyboard, do yourself a favor and practice flying the helos before attempting to use them in missions. 4/5 stars.... with potential! loads of fun to play",2
"dont get me wrong its an ok game but there is some stuff thats bad about it. first of all the ai. the ai once just circled around in a helicopter without even reaching the waypoint. they also repeat everything they say. lastly the realism. i know many of you dont care but its not as realistic as arma 2. in arma 2 you could kill someone with one shot but not in this one. it took me like 10 with a rifle. i do not recomend this game unless there is a huge update. lastly i forgot the physics",3
"beautiful graphics, incredible content in game and via steam workshop a lot of mods available online, a must have for people looking for another kind of shooter or military enthusiast not fast paced, incredibly insane feeling when you cant even see the enemy and youre being shot at 10/10",2
"i crash my car...friend stops his go-kart next to me...police arrives...i tell them my friend stole my car...pointed him to my car...he checks it out...i steal go-kart...i drive as fast as possible...i crash and die gg 10/10",1
"this game takes you closer to reality than any other combat game i have ever played. a must-have if you are a fan of combat simulators that allows you to fight on land, sea and in the air. i do recommend playing it with a few friends, as it can be hard to get good teamwork going with a bunch of random people.",3
"operation flashpoint arma arma 2 british forces operation arrow head queens gambit arma 3 same maps , same ai scripts , same same same. well supported community , great clan game.",4
"i try this game but they try to came with others playing than the others games ... and its confusing and hard to play at the beginning. at the first training, i fired on a box with item and i failed my mission with a friendly fire on a box ... big bugs ...",1
"great game, if your having doubts dont because the game is awesome",1
"love the game since operation flashpoint, i have made missions since then too. paying for dlc that was in arma 2 though? no thanks. spamming me ingame to buy your dlc may make you money but it ruins my immersion in the game and does not a military sim make. the fact this needs pointed out at all makes me realise this franchise has lost its way completely. p.s. you can stick your bipods, too little too late military sim creators",8
"gun play has been much improved from arma 2. not much mods available for mara 3 atm but im sure loads more will be coming out to make the game last even longer 9/10",1
"arma 3 is an awesome combat game which combines open world complexity with call of duty style accessibility.",2
"arma 3 is a huge step-up from arma 2. it features vastly improved graphics. new futuristic weaponry, vehicles and more. i would reccomend this game for everyone!",5
"not the best shooter but if you like being picked of by snipers this is for you",1
"this game is one of the best games i played. was a huge fan of the battlefield series but after the battlefield 4 fail i bought arma 3. there has not been a single moment i regred it. there are enough servers/ gamemodes and there are so many ways you can play the game. there is no end at it you can make you own server and play some missions whit some friends. the players can be  some times and there are still alot of bugs in the game. but overall its a great game",10
"great game my friends need this game fun to play with a bunch of people",4
"this is the best game ever! there is so much to do cant go wrong with this buy.",7
"its a good game, the test on the weekend was great",7
"just dont think of this game as another brainless shooter-runner, this is infantry tatical sim i think. it makes you feel your motal. if you like counter-strike, this may make you crazy. but if you are a sim-gamer, this suits you for the infantry part.",2
"was vary fun at first, despite the optimization if u like arma ull love this but arma 2 has alot more guns and stuff. but it dose have a good campaign.",4
"ultimate military sim, plus procedurely generated warfare!",2
"im going to be completely honest, i bought this game almost exculsively to play the battle royale game mod. as such, i have played very little of the actual campaign of vinilla experience. i can say though that if you like or enjoyed arma style games, you will appreciate the leve of detail and dedication to realism this series provides. the controls are responsive, and the guns handle amazingly. every time i died, it was 99% my fault and the other the lag i blame and curse over the microphone as i mourn my body. if you apprciate more realism to your games then straight up, over the top action, i would recomend giving this series a try. i did not mind spending the money and i bought this before the summer sale. i would highly recomend looking at the modding scene as well which is normally very active with arma series titles (look at the dayz mod)",1
"this game is one of the best simulators i have ever played. it contains many improvements to the engine, graphics, and controls since arma 2. this game has been made better by the steam workshop to host a ton of downloadable senarios. i would recommend you play this game with friends, or some sort of community. some negatives of this game, is its performance, i requires a powerful computer to play, even then there is some sort of performace drop. also there was a lack of single player content, but there is now some being released. im looking forward to the future of this game as it gains popularity, and plus with all the cool expansions arma 2 had, there will probably be new content in the future. one more thing is that there is a huge difficulty spike because its a simulator. this is no call of duty or battle field, and requires alot of time to get used to. if you never had any experience with arma games and you are not shure if you should get arma 3, buy arma 2 + oa, it has been on sale recently for really cheap.",1
"best game ever! needs some minor tweaks and i could recommend a few additional things that would make the game even better but if youre reading this section to find out whether it is worth buying --- i can honestly confirm that if you have a beaty enough pc this game is great!",3
"arma 3 so when i saw this game for the first time, i thought that soon will release another excellent piece arma. however, the first disappointment was already in anticipation, as the extremely small amount of technology and absence campaign. but this disappointment disappeared when issuing the first chapter of the campaign was excellent and the new technique also appeared. but i will not criticize. i must say that the guys from bohemians are struggling and working hard to repair, etc. graphically its a big shift but a new engine this could offer more. the playing area is huge and real and opens new possibilities for mods. technical equipment and weapon was terrible at the beginning and the newly added equipment was broken but gradually improves and fixes. despite this, however, it is compared arma i and ii, step backward. personally, i think that would bohemia interactive could use a better future. on the other hand, however, the campaign is excellent, what more can i say. final verdict: arma iii is an improved forward, but it is incredibly untapped potential. if it bohemia interactive put in the time and dedicated technicians and armor, or even a new engine, so it would be something completely different, much better. 8/10",2
"really good game... just way too expensive. maybe when the game is 15$ and if it still has a community, ill pick it up. unfortunate that so many games fall into this category. it really restricts their communities from growing or even taking hold.",1
"its realistic in terms of graphics and gameplay. lots of different game modes/mods which give the game a broad spectrum, thus catering for any type of player. dayz players would enjoy it.",2
"bohemia have really stepped up their game. i got this while it was still in alpha. felt like arma 2.5 at that point. come now to the release of survive i cant wait for more. imagine that, the story of a bloody arma game has me engaged as . i am only talking about survive, not multiplayer. this is so much better paced than arma 2 was. graphics (minus far terrain) are brilliant. also of all things, pacing is amazing. when choppers start flying over, it has impact. when a mortar hits nearby, it actually has impact because they are not being spammed. there is an idea of scarcity, and it makes you feel like such an underdog. and that is ing brilliant. the feel of control of your guns fells so much better. the sights are also very nice. many improvements over arma 2. overall so far, this is a massive improvement over arma 2, keep this up bohemia, i am really starting to like you guys",1
"singleplayer was ok but multiplayer was hard as hell (immpossible). the arma games get worse each release. if u want a good arma game play arma gold edition.",1
"great game. very immersive and would highly recommend!",1
"great game good graphics if u like shooters get this",1
"arma 3 offers you multiple sandbox multiplayer missions and variety of large scale battle scenarios. bullet travel and weapon ballistics are quite reallistic so its not your standart battlefield game. big maps and large game modding community make this game really specia. 11/10 would play.",6
"this game is one-of-a-kind. you can have so much fun with it, because of its unique gameplay. the events that you will experience in this game cannot be compared to any other game (for example cod or battlefield). you will fear the enemy when the blood in your veins pump with adrenaline when youre shot at! it may have a lot of glitches but that shouldnt be a problem because of the many priviliges you get when buying this game. 9/10 - best of its kind",2
"first time playing alits life i got ran over by a cop. 10/10",2
"at first i was like pew pew pew pew but now im like ... waiting... pew.",3
"good game, worth playing, spent 100+ hours on it!!",1
"an ultrarealistic war simulation. just awesome... and there is the mod support, generating many many great games like breaking point (like dayz) and altis life rpg",1
"arma 3 is a eagerly welcomed upgrade from arma 2. the new stance system, upgraded engine, and water gameplay truly helps you experience the life of a military operator. the best part is that the modding community is stronger than it was for arma 2, with mods ranging to advanced ai to weapon resting, and custom gear to real world weapons, this game does everything better. arma is the only game youre going to find where its a good idea to find youre grandpas old army handbooks.",2
"ill sum it up as. there is a steep learning curve. you cant just pick it up, join a multiplayer match and start shooting people. its not that kind of game. it is however a very team oriented combat simulator. whether is a sniper team of 2, or a fire team of 4/6. you work together and rely on each other. once you get the hang of it, you will love it and keep coming back to it even after playing battlefield 4 and cod.",8
"you should get it. not nearly as complex as people say it is, plus this game is a unique experience you cant get anywhere else",2
