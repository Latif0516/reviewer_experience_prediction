"i started playing heroes of newerth and i enjoyed it very much! alot of my competitive friends left and went to play dota. i eventually ended up doing so too. i cant describe how happy i am with the move. dota 2 is by far the best of its kind. scratch league, scratch hon, scratch and of them other copy cat wannabes and make the switch today. updates all the time, new models all the time, the orginal frog who created this presents is in lead with valve. theres no reason not to switch. stop being a follower and become a leader!",3

"dota 2 is undoubtedly the best mobo game ive ever played.its far better than dota 1 where the graphics is creepy.",3
"its an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. it took me a long time to warm up to, but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. if you can spare the time - play it.",1
"i underestimated this game. i thought it would be just run and kill stuff... well it is kinda exactly what it is, but it is just a thing about the game... it is just... alot of fun",1
"anyone who plays this game for more then 10 minutes a idiot.",4
"i really love dota and the concept of mobas but this one has only one thing that makes it worse than lol and that is playing the exact game mode for hours and hours which is public matches i just wanna play ranked and i think it takes way to long ti hit 13 let alone 25.",1

"im good player at dota 2, im have 0;22 on pudge, im hating ers and love men<3, but no one care because i have no friends. p.s shotout to dendi",1
"dota 2 is a low pace mobas at the beginning of the game, and progresses on to a faster pace haveing you know that you can get killed by a riki at anytime. there are many charaters of dota 2. over 75 acutally, then these 75 are split into three groups. intelligent(s), strengh(s),and aglilty(s). you can either pick top lane, middle lane, or bottom lane. top lane is know as the hard lane aka try not to day at all lane. middle is a fast lane that you fight for (your lane) but you can a exp/gold adventage, then bottem lane. you then have the easy lane to get away from a gank or can pull a camp and have the enemy closer to your tower. overall i think i can give the game a 9.5 out of 10",1
"better than lol, because i have about 48 minutes in the game, so i clearly know what im talking about..... jk...",1
"despite playing too much league of legends i actually enjoy playing some dota 2 from time to time... even though i suck at it... did i mention its free?",1
"the most fascinating and definitely one of the most complex games has ever been created in the whole human history. each game, every moment are unique. its all about cooperation between teammates and in the same time the important thing - someones particular performance. bad performance, failed cooperation. failed cooperation, no win!",4
"never ever liked to play strategy games before.... this game i didnt want to try either... but after playing this....i realized that this one is different.... like u literally play on the same map over and over and over again..... yet u dont feel bored at all.... for the last few months i have played mostly dota ....... it really helped me get over game strategies... now every single rpg game seems like knife and butter.... recommend it to everyone",1
"endless hours of fun with quite a learning curve in the beginning, luckily bots are available for new players",2
">picks chen >spam test of faith >rage insues >reported to hell >0 k 20 d >gg wp 10/10 its ok",1
"great game. just attracts you. it is basically a weird game that people play coz they just want to compete with frndz or over xp them. but after te4chies update :3. the game is lagging. and steam community takes time to show its msg in game",2
"so addictive, my life has been messed up because of this game. an absolute must play. it made me very racist and hate well russians.. there is nothing left to say. 1 couple of games its like noob ish and you will get pissed on a lot, thats why there are bot matches.. take a risk in this game if its for your liking. dont take to heart all of the rubbish people say. they can get quite intense when they rage. i mean, like really",2
"i really love dota since dota 1 and i will never forget playing dota",3
"600 hours in 6 months. 10/10 would ruin life again",2
"just amazing game,i have been playing this game like 4 n half years now...1st dota 1 then this,never gets boring..... kinda addictive game....but u will have real fun playing this game.idk bout lol but this is just amazing n most skillfull game. doesnt matter if u r new in dota family,game provides all basic lessons in-game. but u still need 2 control your hunger after playing this game..kinda destroys your important hours of your life as well if u got no self control.",2

"a great pvp game that offers some of the most intriguing and nuanced team combat around.",1
"blyat. after 1,000 hours of this game, i can say it is one of the best games i have played. but, i wouldnt advise you to play it as it will drain the f***ing soul out of you, and you will not have any life from then on. however, if you do decide to play this game, report the russians and flame your team.",2
"game is awesome. took me a little while to get in to it, because when you first start dota seems complicated, confusing, and spontaneous. after a week or so of playing/trying to understand the game i understood it and tried to learn some of the basics so i could actually play. so try it, it will take you a while to get a hang of it but when you do this game will be so fun you need to play it every day for the rest of your life. i highly recommend this game to everyone! try it out!",2
"yo this game is real life chess witch happen between 2 terrotory ( play to known )",3

"awesome moba, 10/10. i would play this alot more if i werent already playing league of legends, but anyway it is a great game and greatly recommended.",1
"i ing hate this game. it punishes you without belief and treats you unfairly, it is fun when you get good team mates but 80% of the time it makes me want to murder babies. not because of the difficulty but because the team mates i get either suck or kill-steal",3

"amazing game a hrad learning curve but its fun when you finally learn how to play!!",1
"its awesome you all should try this. its worse than drugs, it destroys your life 1 game at a time.",4
"the best is when your team has a bad game and the guy with aspergers (dota requires at least 1 per team at all times - kind of like when you play intramural soccer and you have to have 2 girls on the field at all times or you forfeit) starts complaining that everyone on the team is anything from a scrub to a f@#!ing f@#%ot who should uninstall and kill themselves. of course this happens after they call mid within .46 seconds of the game starting and they have pinged the map at least 1.6 million times. it helps that there is an 80% chance that you will play a hero you are completely unfamiliar with, since there are 1.4 billion of them. my favorite is when you get a hero that you have never played before and their abilities require you to do complex math. much enjoy. such amazing. cant. get. enough.",1
"recommended if youre looking for some stressful and full of spanish and russian speaking people entertainmeint",3
"like league of legends, but takes skill and is fun.",4
"dota 2 is one of the best games played. you can play as hundreds of different heroes. not many other games give out this chance! :p play it! its free. :d",1

"i have never felt so weak and helpless in a game. 11/10 would recommend to everyone.",1
"dota 2 is multiplayer battle online arena with high skill cieling, no pay to win elements and a lot of russians.",2
"this game is very challenging and requires intelligence choose items that fit as well as team collaboration to determine how to defeat the enemys tactics. i really like this game so much",2
"9/10 best language learning program there is. 9/10 because it insnt a game, its an educational program so it shouldnt be marketed as a game ;p jk i love dota",1
"amazing game. nothing more to say, the game says it all. a must try!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"dota 2 is not something you lazily play once a week, but something you live. you hate it and love it, you fear it and you enjoy it. its everything at the same time but most of all - never boring!",3
"its a truly amazing game, best with a couple of friends. get it and id be glad to play it with you.",3
"i love playing this game! favorite character is night stalker!",1
"i recomend this game with all i have. i have become addicted and cant stop playing. this is way better than leagues.",2
"game ni best pantat2..jom ah main kawan2..sumpah terbaik gila bapak!!",3
"this game will turn you into a racist, antisocial and angry person. 10/10 would recommend.",4
"yes, i recommend this game to my relative & my friend. this game full of strategy, thats need people to think, strategies, create a teamwork to a victory. just like reality life, if we want to achieve our goal, we cant do it alone. we need teammate, teamwork to achieve the goal. same with dota 2, its create teamwork, close the relationship, prove the strength of relationship, trust & doubt. one thing that i dislike is, dont too addicted to game, you can spend gaming around 2-3 hours. spend another quality hour with your family, your parent, your wife, your kids too. overall, i recommend this game to reduce your stress, dont push yourself if you are about to lose a game.. dont worry, its just a game. no people will blame you.. cheers to all dota 2 gamers.. :)",1
"a classic for all moba lovers also the dota is the mother of all other mobas",1
"this is a really awesome game. the main reason i think that is because its not only a game with great gameplay, but the community around it is also great. this game really showed me that professional competitive gaming is a thing. to me this is a absolutaly revolutionary game.",1
"when i played dota wc3 mod for the first time i died as windrunner and moved on to hero line wars. now that value has made dota 2 i tried it again. the f2p model is very fair, almost too fair which lets in undesirables. the graphics are clean and crisp. the gameplay is what you expect from an rts, lots of clicking and moving your unit around or, for you plebs out there, lack there of. there is a rating system that and that really is the worst. i have close to dial up internet and lag all game. my rating sucks because of this and the reason i am writing this is because i am waiting for a 100mb download aka 2 hours. all that said icefairy has made heroine in video game form and its free /dance....zzzz doesnt work",5
"be me a game developer for a free to play game that is loved by thousands... but how do i make the money? a few people will buy my cosmetic items at $30 a pop but what if i could get thousands to buy my stuff for $1 or $2 dollars how much more money could i make?",2

"10/10 would get chain stunned by bots endlessly again",1
"cool game, a bit of multiple elements. some strategy, strong micromanagement, teamplay makes and breaks the games. with an element of rpg. and its free!! what more u need? get in here!!",3
"pros: awesome game. you never get bored of it. cons: it takes time to learn.",1
"a compelling game that allows casual gamers to engage on a more intellectual and active battlefield. fast paced, intense action await those who crave for tactical moba skirmishes! around a hundred heroes to choose from, and a million more to play with. great job valve!",5
"ive wasted all my money on a free to play. 10/10 would bang.",3
"game is full of mental losses, even when winning it causes depression, anguish, hatred towards team members and friends and general disarry of any sence of humanity. yet it brings me back everytime, like a fly to . i guess i would give this game a 8/10. minus 2 points because i am unable to read the keyboard through my tears.",5
"okay, i recommend and do not recommend at the same time: why i recommend: - its a valve game, come on people! - the training missions are good. i put 2 hours into them. - its freaking free - just get it if youre looking for a random game to play why i do no recommend: - it just sucks - i am not the kind of person to play this game. - i like campaigns, not massively multiplayer stuff.",1
"for the low low price of your soul and entire social life in the trash, this game is sure to make you a racist, an , or both (or get your theoretical money back!). so, come now and experience 1 year before the divorce - simulator, also known as dota 2 and mother russia - the game. ***surgeon generals warning: this game is proven to give people social and moral cancer. user discretion is adviced.***",2
"dota 2 is super popular, thats an understatement. though im not really a fan, and personally find the game boring. i have to admit its very well made.",1
"this game is the best game of all time . i think that dota will last forever . i want to see my son play dota :3",3
"awesome game. one will be addicted so easily. love to play it :d if size of the update will reduced it will be more fun. enjoy it.",2
"very hard but fun game. lear team work, game specific skills, and how to hate other people.",2
"truly an amazing game once u start to play it with ur friends or with other people. although it might be confusing and difficult from the start, but once u start playing u just cant stop. and u get all that experience for free",3
"fun at first, but gets very boring after playing for a while.",2
"from an avid league player, its a bit hard to get into and understand at first. but once you get your main role going and start to learn the heros you can play it can get pretty fun. until you meet viper... /rage about one of his passives is a slow every auto attack compared to league it has a lot less skill shots and more lock ons. however there is still a lot of skill to be had at this game, not runes or masteries, denying, and losing some gold upon death. just make sure you dont spam your spells. your mana pool is very low and mana regen is little to nothing early game. a very different game with not a lot to compare to, but theyre both equally fun in their own way.",1
"if your blood seeks wars, history, heroes and sacrifice, this is the game for you.",1
"do you want to go killing spree with your friends? go buy this game",1
"addicting game, i learned a lot about myself and my family playing it. its funny how small the world is, everyone know my mom and some people even had relationships with her! i hope it was before my father married them. anyway, that does not matter anymore, after i found out i was gay ( to be precise), my father kicked me out of the house. its ok, apparently i was adopted when i was younger so i will take this time to move to russia and find my family. hope to play again when i get back, who knows what else can i learn!",3
"awesome game ! i spent so much of my time in this game and im going broke ! lovely!!",3
"i learned russian in this game more than school so you should play this game............of russians.",2
"the best language learning tool on the internet. learn to speak spanish, russian, and portuguese for the low low price of your self-esteem and faith in others",1
"team fortress 2 hats crossed with mobas with a sprinkle of valve magic... this is why gaben sleeps on a bed of my money. and i regret nothing.",1
"seriously, ive gone from paying heroes of newrth to league of legends to dota and the only game ive stuck to playing constantly out of the three is dota. i find it easier than hon but more challenging than league. i have no major glitches like i did when i played league and i love all the heroes that can be played. ive gotten quite a few of my friends to either pick dota 2 back up or to start playing it. like any other game you run into a few rude players but otherwise the community is great. i highy recommend this to anyone looking for a game to play like league or hon!",1
"it hurts to play ive wasted alot of hours trying to play and still  game",2
"there is no game that can get you depressed and madder than adolf hitler in 1945, and still have you keep playing it. good game, especially with friends.",4
"amazing game. great to play with lots of friends in 5 person steam calls. there is a bit of a learning curve but once you get over that its awesome",1
"it is a rather good game that you can play for hours but in my opinion after a few days you get bored of it and leave it for a day or two it is a strategy game that i would say is the best one out there.(that i have played)",3
"boring game ever. do not install it. cuz u lost so many(or much. so i dont care) time.",4
", im lost three years, one year dota 2 and two year warcraft dota",3
"the waiting times are atrocious due to the lack of a server browser. the community seems to consist of only people who take the game too seriously or people who are so inept they dont even know what wards are. the camera doesnt zoom out far enough. the artstyle is boring. theres only one map. actual player involvement feels minimal. its an e-sport. its rife with griefing potential. its boring.",1
"like being yelled at? like yelling at people? this game is perfect, 10/10.",1
"too many foreigners on servers they dont belong to, resulting in bad communication and them having bad lag issues all the while screaming  and blyat in the microphone... (mainly russians) otherwise great game.",4
"played the game for thousands of hours, still cant speak russian. education system is to blame. 9/10 ready would  blyat again.",5
"fun, competitive and team work game if u like dota, lol, hon u should love this too",3
"very addictive! you cant just play 1 game in a day haha and because of my love to this game and because i dont want to be separated from it dota 2 i decided to open my own internet cafe for gaming, now lots my customers are playing 24hours, haha addicting but i am using it for some profit in return! so instead of being called a useless  i am now called a business owner! haha keep it up makers of dota 2, i salute you! c, )",3
"this is a very awsome game must be tried once in life time. this game is also addictive and moralfull.",2
"very frustrating game that requires team work something some people cannot grasp",3
"made me a sad, racist person with a desire to hoard as much stuff as i can so i can show it off later. 10/10",2
"dota 2 does not need review, it is epic if you are a moba fan :)",1

"even how many times you were playing this game, it never gets boring!! m/",2
"okay i must admit i liked this call of duty, but its very unbalanced because theres capt bloodseeker being a  to everyone including his own team, overall i like this call of duty and battlefield: league of legends is for casual babies",4
"this game made me understand why communism didnt work. because if it worked, the russians wouldnt have dota.",2
"awesome game for the people with good reaction and nice attitude.",5
"i like this game `cause it make mmo more competitive and challenging between the players. the diversity of heroes and their abilities (in addition to the players) influences absolutely everything and will never be a game like another.",4
"the best game ever in the world. full strategy and teamwork",2
"10/10 report brazil, russia and south east asia for feeding.",2
"mostly everything is good except for the matchmaking system. it is quite broken. valve need more effort to revamp matchmaking system to ensure everyone has a more decent and more enjoyable gaming experience in dota 2. overall rating is 8/10.",1
"stress, amnesia, sleep loss, money loss (in-gane items nearless object etc, will be damaged) might be some of the side effect but the thrill of killing winning rampaging makes up for it 10/10 boiiiii",1
"dota 2 is a challenging game, and i have watched many of the friends i have tried to get to play ragequit, saying its too hard!. even so, my personal experience has been a great one. the graphics are very fine, giving you a breath-taking, beautiful world to conduct battle in every time. the combot is fast-paced and well tuned, giving you 100+ characters with abilities that are well designed and feature very well done animation. one downside of dota matchmaking is that you often get teamed with people who dont speak your language, making team-coordination harder in pub matches, but matchmaking is very fast. a game best played with friends, dota is an awesome moba that will draw your attention continuosly after the first game. graphics- 9/10 gameplay- 9/10 matchmaking 7/10 overall- 8/10",3
"dota 2 is a very good strategy game that i recomend, it is better than other mobas like lol as you cant buy anything to give you an advantage, just vanity items like huds",1
"great game, put 406 hours into it so far and doesnt get old. dota 4 life",1
"this game is a , always in  teams, would rage again 10/10",3

"ill try my best .. in all game .. !!!!!!!! ^_^ (y) ^_^",1
"you constantly learn new stuff about this game. infuriating at times, but rewarding in the end. amazing depth and many different ways to be successful, teamplay and playing with thought are very important though. extremely few games have as much depth as this game has.",4
"very addictive game! straight to play with all characters! gain battle points, ranks and new items for the characters. and its free!",2
"be one of the champions in dota 2, win or not, the world will never forget you, even you die. thats what i will call this game.",1
"i like this game because when i have a problem im going to play this game and my problem will granted.",1
"over the course of almost 2 years playing this game, i can affirm that my proficiency in speaking foreign languages has improved drastically. thank you, volvo.",2
"play it, play it now! 6.80 will blow!!!! best game since wow, nothing got me hooked so much...",1
"a game for which you have to use brain and brawns to win it!! a well worth e-sport if i must say..",4
"learning curve isnt as bad as people make out. fun to play with some friends, and even better when you pull off good strategies.",1
"changed my whole perception of moba games, great game, great creators, great community. and for free... what are you waiting for?",1
"before i started playing dota i had everything. now i dont. 10/10",4
"if you havent played this game already, or been bombed to death with free keys from valve, what the hell are you waiting for? prepare to fume from frustration from the russians, or just n00bs from every single country imaginable. no seriously though this game is ing awesome.",2
"the literal best game ever but will devouer your life!!",2
"great game! the learning curve is however very steep, and you will probably end up losing a lot of your first games (as you get flamed by your teammates). but as you get better, youll quite enjoy it. by far the best moba experience you can have.",3
"if youre masochistic and enjoy listening to people cuss you out in portuguese, spanish, and russian, you should play. make sure to set your server settings to us west, us east, and preferred language to english to get the best portuguese/spanish/russian experience.",1
"great game a lot like leauge but some major diffrences. its also very fluid",1
"if this game comes near me one more time i am gonna scream. time? ... eaten. money? ... eaten. compassion towards noobs? ... demolished. gg, report mid, ez, .i.",2
"i like dota because it allows me to use my strategic plan and it also boost my confidence and to improve my team building training",2
"probably my favorite moba. was heavy into league and struggled getting used to this. once you get used to it though, its tons more fun than league.",2
"dota 2 is almost perfect, one thing that makes it annoying for some traders are the scammers who keeps trying to scam people on dota 2,the fact that if you can please make some operations to track those who attemp to scam and ban them if found that the said/reported account has a multiple report submitted from the community. your consideration is highly appreciated.",2
"one of the best strategy games in the whole universe.",2
"each match of dota 2 is independent and involves two teams, both containing five players and each occupying a stronghold at either end of the map. located in each stronghold is a building called the ancient; to win, a team must destroy the enemys ancient. each player controls a hero character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory. overall, this game is a very intense and full of war occurrences, spell caster, magic and physical damage, even the absolutely stunning built-up for every each heroes. this game, dota 2, is the best multi-player game available on the market yet...!",2
"addicted to this game u cant stop once u know what to do hahaha",2
"pushes you to racism, hate, various emotional disorders and borderline suicidal state. would definitely recommend.",2
"this game is a lot of fun. you will probably start off terrible, but the trick is to watch videos and play a lot. im still not that good at it, but its fun.",1
"dota 2, a very frustrating game that forces you to play with and against other players. youll rely on your team to preform their selected roles, and then watch in horror as they completely ignore the game mechanics and just chase down kills, rarely successfully. you build in game items during the match to enhance your characters role and then hope and pray your team doesnt feed the opposition too much. team fights, normally 5v5, tend not to happen as you watch your fellow team members run to meet their fate and be a hero. sadly this ends up throwing the game and you lose. i would still recommend this game, purely for those few matches when the your whole teams synergy is in harmony, watch as the gold floods in, the towers crumble and the opposition blame each other for their loss.",3

"wasnt sure what to think about this game when alex introduced it to me. i found it hard to believe that there were league and championships dedicated to play this let alone the hype behind it, though that could be my doupts due to its link with blizzard. its very fun and here valve are just laughing at the bank with the game as people loved the origonal so much. in this case, you might as well just give your money to valve, its making that much. very fun rpg, yet hard to explain. you get to pick a character, level him/her/it up and the objective is to destroy the enemy base. each base creates small creatures called creeps and you gain gold for xp by killing creeps and destroying towers. in this case the creeps are red-shirts, running into battle and no real loss when they die. you can download it for free, spectator a match and see what you think. what do you have to lose?",1

"a game with an amazing community which never fails to blame everybody else when they make mistakes. dota teaches a variety of different languages including the infamous russian, which teaches players to despise anybody who does not speak english as their first language. as well as being multicultural, the dota 2 matchmaking is just phenomenal. it always ensures you are put with first class russian feeders, which really improves the gameplay as it allows you to be unable to play a game of dota without experiencing the variety of different styles of play that this game offers to the community. as a whole this game encourages suicidal thoughts, rage and possible brain hemorrhages and/or heart attacks. 10/10 would uninstal, then reinstal. 11 vodkas  cyka blyat mid or fid",3
"dota 2 is chess for people with a strategic and impatient disposition. it focuses on strategy, if you rush into it without proper thought and planning there is a very slim chance of success. but that does not make it slow paced, quite the opposite. even if are mindlessly whacking away on some neutral creeps in the jungle you can feel the energy in the air. the only problem i have with it is the community. entering youre first match is the quickest and most effective way of destroying your soul. the chat is almost always filled with the words stupid noob whenever you check it, and im not going to get in to the low-priority matches *makes gaging sound*. apart from that, it is one of the best moabs i have ever had the fortune to come across. check mate.",1

"strangely addictive after youve figure out one hero. alternatively frustrating and exhilirating. interesting events. nice when you have a team or bunch of friends but also good to play solo. love the hero items and effects. agonizing to play when the internet connection is bad or when you have abusive teammates. every game, even played with the same people, is different. infinite combinations of heroes, items, usage and player skills. takes some time to get the hang of any hero at first but some help always... helps... hahaha... =) enjoy!!",2

"turn hours of your life to great rage. forces you to lose confidence in all other. 10/10",3
"its a great game. i highly recommend it because of the amount of variety. it gives you over 50.. no.. over 100 combinations of characters and items to use in battle. in dota 2 you rely both on strategy and strength, and in some cases, even teamwork. but there are some few drawbacks, for example, theres only 1 map and finding an online game in some regions takes several minutes. ( or at least, that is my case ). but still, the design of characters, effects and models, compared to the ones from dota 1, are fascinating. i really like the new heroes look. plus, its not like you really have to pay for useful weapons and items. you can buy things in-game, in map shops to strengthen your hero, and even your team. i really give this game a high ranking!",1

"it will consume your life entirely, setting you back at least one year, condition you to feel anger towards other cultures when you hear someone speaking a different language, and, cause you to spend a lot of money on making your heroes fancier. it wont let you have a relaxing game when you have down time, let you enjoy any other game ever again, nor let you feel good about yourself. youll have dreams of going pro, youll claim mmr doesnt matter, and then youll realize youre a terrible 3k scrub. but youll be okay with that, go mid and feed. 10/10, would fall into addiction and be consumed again.",5
"as much as i only have 20 hours on this game, there isnt much to talk about. the game is addicting as  and can ruin your life if you dont control it. its the same game over and over again. two sides, the same map, same defences and ancients. the sounds, graphics, and game play is just awsome. however, i do find the community to suck alot. i do not have a problem with the russians but my problem is most of the people who do speak english are the most whiny  people and report if you dont do as they say. then theres the unfair system of the penalty pool. the fact that one can get reported with no evidence and suffer longer waiting times and ier . in conclusion, i recomend people to play this game with a group of friends, maybe time to time random servers but be careful that this game wont ruin your life.",2
"okay 1st,i recomend this game because its amazingness of moba , its better than any other moba out there and because i have friend that also play it. i usually play dota2 with my real life friend that also play d2. we play for fun and for win, if we lose we just talk to each other about hero combos and never get mad even if a player in our team which is not our friend talking putang ina mo/ tang ina bobo( in se asia) or anjing babi.... but i never recomend this game for a beginner player that has no friend that also play, it will become 50% stress, 50% fun ,even if you win ppl who are rude will still talk about your tiniest mistake (e.g: forget to use items or skills). cause some peoples only play this game for winning and blame every ppl. sry for my bad english",3

"dota 2 is hard, but theres a huge reward for those who commit. on the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) defense of the ancients modification for warcraft iii, now transferred into valves source engine. the games punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but its worth sticking the hours in: success in dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.",3

"steep learning curve, but once you invest the time to not suck then it is a pretty addictive and fun game. the teamwork aspect of it is what makes it and/or breaks it if you are unlucky to be paired with a feeding player. that said, if you can find a small core of people that you consistently play with then win or lose it is a pretty awesome game. oh, and dont use riki or sniper unless you have to. just trust me.",3

"if your the type of guy/girl who loves gaming and wants too suck up your time with something, play dota. it can in many ways be co-operative and solo action at the same. it takes time too learn many of the mechanics and items, but when you have most of them under your rule you will be a lion amongst riki, ursa, pudge, axe... please do give it a try, and if you can, teach some lol players how well this can be. ps. beware multiple ammounts of russians.",2
"an awesome game. and im into racing and cars. a bit of a learning curve, but highly rewarding once you get into even the average skilled matches. i suggest to read guides and practice last hitting and denying for a while in passive difficulty in a custom game. you cant get too good at last hitting.",1
">join game >watch your team pick invoker, pudge, bloodseeker, and riki >you just random at this point >end up with jug >team fights for mid >team gets angry >no one gets courier >get yelled at for being the best player >team loses >four reports+abandon because you were afk on the post game screen too long 10/10 would recommend to grandmother",1

"with the amount of fans of the original dota (defense of the ancients) i can say you will have around 1-2 mins of waiting time which is not as bad as the csgo waiting time which takes close to 20-25 mins.dota is a moba (multiplayer online battle arena) its a mixed of rts but you only use 1 hero.if you are a fan of fast paced strategic rts-like gameplay then i would highly recommend this game.if you are really want to start of this game i would suggest learning the curves by playing with bots before playing online with other players.the community for the game is around the level of being really good to being really bad,meaning some people are just really big s while there are also really awesome players to play with..i would also suggest playing with some friends and play in a party..its alot better..i hope you guys the best :) i would give this game a thumbs up!",3

"dota can be described in two words fun and annoying. dota is a game that not only helps you with your team work but also gets you closer to your friends as you work together to win the match. although that might seem cool dota is also a stressful game that when you screw up everybody on the server screams at you calling you noob etc. trust me this will happen. i rate dota 2 a: 9/10 this game is a masterpiece",1
"worst game, would not play over 3k hours of it or base my steam profile around it.",4
"such a good game. best for teamwork / teamplay. two thumbs up for this game",3
"a good twist on a mmo mostly focused on strategy. this game is playable by a wide range of players due to its different playing style for each character. whether you are a supporter role for a team or the leader or the pusher. all of them offer unique gameplay styles. the objective though rather simple is rather hard to achieve in fact and can lead you to racking your brains to think of the best way to destroy the enemies base. this game forges camarderie among players as each player in the team have to work with each other and support each other with the different skillsets they each have. i strongly recommend you trying this game for a classic game twisted into something fresh and renewed, its worth a try and most certainly will find a playing style in there to suit you.",1
"i am addicted to this game,just like how i was addicted to tf2 before,very.",3
"made my family think i got some kind of mental illness.... 10/10",3

"this game is more addicting than the most addicting substance on earth.",1
"great game, its league of legends but a little harder.",1
"a unique and epic follow-up to the old and infamous dota, that not only lives up to a really long-built reputation, but surpasses its predecessor in every possible way. riskier, faster, stronger, more rewarding, frustrating at times, but funnier nonetheless. and maybe what tends to be in the eyes of the gamer a flaw and a massive drawback, might perhaps and personally be the games greatest characteristic that will only keep reinventing itself viciously in terms of endless gaming; its very hard to learn, considering that after taking years for one to accustom themselves in every dirty, tricky and veteran way of dota 2, they might have a long way ahead in order to truly master it. but, can this really happen? -",3
"best game, lol isnt even close to dota 2s level. if you havent tried this game, well your missing out.",2

"playing hard makes you improve your skill. playing with friends is fun.",4
"youll need knowledge, skill, and a smidge of spider-sense. friends to learn with are a must, and dont be deceived by the lack of a pricetag: dota 2 will cost you hundreds of hours.",5
"fast and addictive game of tactic, teamwork and knowing your enemies.",1
"i started playing heroes of newerth and i enjoyed it very much! alot of my competitive friends left and went to play dota. i eventually ended up doing so too. i cant describe how happy i am with the move. dota 2 is by far the best of its kind. scratch league, scratch hon, scratch and of them other copy cat wannabes and make the switch today. updates all the time, new models all the time, the orginal frog who created this presents is in lead with valve. theres no reason not to switch. stop being a follower and become a leader!",3

"only played a few games and yh its alright i guess",5
"first my 20 hours of playing dota was soo booring , then i started playing with my firends and i said -hmm... thats game is cool-",1
"good game however there are still alot that can be developed. 1. in solo matches it should only be solo not even a tag duo should be allowed. 2. country preference should be made so that there would be no complaints with filipino players and other players that are noob alike. 3.balance in the game should be random and should not be determined by your winnings which in some cases you will be paired with newbies that join mmr matches and looks for someone who can carry them. win rate to win rate, and lose rate to lose rate. good game enjoy the action.",1
"wish that administrator gives more low priority games for communication abuse, many players here are very discriminating especially to the race of players. i know that punishment isnt a good drive for a change but its the only way to catch the players attention. thanks and more power!",2
"this game will teach you about life. it will teach you about the futility of being an individual, unable to cause real change. it will teach you that no matter how hard you try, if the people around you screw up it will fall on you and you will be blamed for it. it will teach you that everyone expects to get the spotlight and leave you in the dark. it will teach you many, many things. it will also make you hate russians. and... well, just about anyone who doesnt speak your language. your life will never be the same. you are not ready. run while you still can. its too late for me... 100/10 would play again.",3
"dont play this game if you want to have a life. 500% recommended",3

"intense once you learn it, awesome to play with a group of friends. very competitive!",2
"this is a great game. i used to play the warcraft 3 user map settings version. it was addicting way back then, and it is still addicting now. i played league of legends before i played dota 2, and i admit i was a little scared of the transition from league to dota. but as i write this review now, i do not think i will ever play league of legends again. i will stick to playing dota2 from now until forever. perhaps its the nostalgia it gives me or perhaps its fact that everyone is a  on league of legends. eitherway, this is a great game to get into, especially if mobas are your type of game.",1
"this is a very nice game that i played in my life! even when i 17 years old i started playing dota 1 and now dota 2 all i can say this is a dream game!",3
"in dota 2, you got only 2 choices: win as a hero or lose as a coward.",4
"never get enough with this game. long live dota 2 =)) b-)",2
"quite tough for new players, but you once you start digging deep youll find an infinite amount of depth in this gem. originally a warcraft 3 mod, this faithful remake brings the original into an all new graphics style which is very pleasant to look at. the game itself is a bottomless pit of mastering every hero, every item, and digging deep into the mechanics for the win. this game rewards time investment with a world that in some ways rivals ten games in complexity and depth. plus, its completely free, save for cosmetic items that dont affect gameplay at all. this means that all the characters will be unlocked right from the get-go. and of course, new heroes are still being added from the mod. i really look forward to the ongoing future for this game - winning a match beats everything else in its euphoria effect, and riding the high is half the game of dota 2. play it - even if youre scared of the community.",1

"started out playing dota on the old wc3 engine and i played that for 7+ years before i shifted into dota 2 with the beta. dota 2 offers much more than the original wc3 version in terms of graphics and gameplay, as the old engines hero and skill interactions were hampered by limitations (dota allstars was just a custom map). cosmetics, tournaments, and streaming are all seamlessly integrated; and are constantly being improved at the behest of the community. the game is a bit hard to get into at first, but after you have the basics down, youll play for an innumerable amount of time. adding friends into the mix for crazy strategies and plays increases the replayability and enjoyment of the game to another level. one of the best games. ever.",3

"healthy game...just dont get emotional then it will be good",3
"do you smoke crack cocaine? have you ever considered smoking crack cocaine? do you enjoy long hours spent inside and alone? if any of these questions resonate with you, then perhaps dota2 is the game for you. the game has an extremely high skill cap and takes years to begin understanding the fundamental concepts and mechanics. the competitive play is intense and rewarding. if you plan on having any additonal hobbies, vocational activities, or love interests. please consider severing all ties before installing. you wil hurt the ones you love.",3

"dota 2 is a game about getting fat, and whoever is the fattest of them all wins. if your 5 man fat orgy gets fatter faster than the other growing pile of mass on the other side of the map, then when these two hideous blobs of lard collide youll still have some fat to toss around at the enemy while they scream at each other for not being fat enough. on the other hand when youre both at the weigh in and the other teams got some bigger numbers to boast about, youll find yourself being smothered, crushed by the fat; it betrays you! they pull you in, absorbing you into their ever growing blob as your teammates are yelling to stop feeding their mass. it becomes increasingly apparent that you are not the fattest of them all, and you start to wonder why you ever started playing dota 2 in the first place...",2

"well first thing i would like to say is that dota is a great game because well... its one of my first moba series like warcraft and the original dota. although sometimes you may come across some people that report you ofr not knowing how to play it is actually a fun game. its not a pay to win but you can buy skins, announcers, etc. a couple things need to be added such as maps, gamemodes, and some heroes but overall: 9/10",1

"i have been playing this game since long days. it is a very nice game.i like it.",2
"good game; bad community. dont play it and expect it to be a game that you can just pick up and play. doing the above will only net you russians, brazillians, and being put on the worst teams imaginable. also, valve isnt volvo, people; you couldve lived without diretide.",1
"so ive never been a fan of mobas, was just to lazy to learn how to play them until league came along. oh god, the good times ive had on league, slowly becoming better and better, but it slowly became a game that i loved to play buy also hated to play. the community was  as i had 5 players on the opposite team hatin on me, and then my own ing teammates hatin on me. so i made the switch to dota2 and i am totally satisfied. the game play is awesome, the champions are interesting and creative, its everything i love about a moba. personally i like it more than league now that ive played it for a while. pros: fun game, a good moba, creative heroes, good community, better than league ;) cons: some minor glitches that can be fixed quite easily and occur due to stupidity xd so yes, even to people who hate mobas, i recommend that you try and get to know how to play the game before you judge it.",1
"this game ruined my life 10/10 goty it burned my eyes would recommend exciting (read: enraging) experience",3
"this game helps you learn new languages i learned russian and spanish because of this better language learning program rosetta stone, and its free!! this program uses the efficient strategy of frustration, anger, idiotic people, raging, and loss in hope of humanity. 10/10 would dota again",2

"yeah.. because it is full of enjoyment and ecitement.. :)",1
"the community can tell you firsthand that this game is quite possibly the best and worst game on earth. with the recent boom in its e-sports presence its worth trying for that reason alone. you may love it or hate it but one things for certain. those who love it, really love it (myself included).",2
"dota 2 consists the most unblanaced heros for any game on the market as of right now! there so many over powered abilities on too many heros. in fact, the heros are considered over powered are played every single, of every single match. dota 2 is the worst game, i have ever played due to the lack community(which is toxic), hero abilities which are over powered, and all around broken game. if you like your sanity, do not play this game. if you do not want to become racist, do not play this, if you dont rich pumping  tons of money into professional gaming just so the game can make a buck or two, do not play game. if you do not like russia, do not play this game. if you do not like any hispanic, do no play this game. basically, what saying to you, if you want to play a moba, go play league of legends.",3
"very nice game. its my chance to training my gaming skills",1
"its is a very good game with good balancing and intersting abilities, but as you probaly read before, you can compare the communitie with a waste bin. people will just scream at you when you do someting wrong and leave the game after that and dont forget the famous mid or feed strategy. communication in this game is hard, the game does it good at that point, but then the russians and arabians or whatever show up when you clearly clicked eu-west and that you want to meet up with english people instead of other language. so yeah, game is perfectly with regulary updates and interesting events, but the communitie really needs to get better (i mean a lot better) or valve should just link english people with real english people and auto search for the best server instead of choosing the server. i would say 9.5/10 for the game (nothing is perfect) and 2/10 for the communitie (sometimes you meet a nice person)",2

"blatant chinese rip-off of the all-time classic: league of legends. they added a bunch of homogay pixie mechanics to seem deep and to attract casuals who want to feel cool. they also copied a bunch of champions and ruined them completely. ashe is now blue or purple or something, malphite turned into a non-manly moeblob, and alistar became some gay midget ninja who is always ing invisible and wont leave me alone and keeps throwing pink smoke at me. holy  stop stabbing me. buuut, despite its flaws, its a decent game. ill stop being buttflustered once i can start carrying people like i can in the original superior game.",1

"for those who have played a moba game, i recommend dota 2. however its not fully perfect yet. language wise it is a mess. even if you pick english as your choice. you will get games with russians, brazilians, mexicans, and etc from time to time and there is really nothing you can do about until it is fixed. game play wise its a bit slower pace then heroes of newerth, but much faster then league of legends and equally as competitive.",4

"i recommend this game 100%. the best of all steam.",2
"this is very high quality game. graphics are very detailed and good. but still, you can play on low quality and enjoy. the thing about this game is, that while starting , you wait too much time : match searching and player waiting. players often fail to connect. second thing, if you like rpg games, the fact that someone can be first and take the hero that you like, want will be terrible. and to be short, if you dont have enough free time to spend (40 min-1hour) on match, dont start it, if you leave , you wll recieve abandon and ruin your teams game (butin reality no one knows is it ruining or helping , couse in late game, money is everything and your money will be spreaded between your teammates). so yea you should try this game if you like competition and sometimes rage :)",1
"i really love this game it is amazing and it can easily lure you toward its addiction and once u start u will never find the time to stop and the time to stop will never come trust me :) i just hate the fact that there is no banning nor option to stop having newbies in your games ... otherwise, i recommend it for everyone :) just plz dont be noobs and ruin our games",1
"after hours and hours of torture you will finally wake up and realize you were wasting your time. you will never be a pro, never be a star, so give up now. dont play this soul sucking game. get out while you still can. just go buy destiny or something. please save yourself you go damn feeding .",3

"my favorite games on steam! if you play a lot and your good come join my guild! my guild is called calicos crew (crew). we are planning to go into tornaments and crush the competition. i highly reccomend this game if you have steam why havent you downloaded this game yet. click that install button. oh yeah best part its free!",1

"once you understand the basics of the gameplay it is a highly enjoyable game. i cant think of a game as much fun to play with friends, except maybe starcraft. if you play lol i would recommend switch to dota so you can play a moba that needs a bit of skill.",4
"a wonderful romp through intraspection; every game offers new insights into ones sexuality and right to life.",4
"new update is great! ive never been able to get less credit for matches than ever. go d/cing!!! 420/10",2

"dota 2 has changed my life... i have spend all my money on virtual pants whilst spending night after night...naked...playing dota until my sweaty buttcrack is glued stuck to my chair. and the worst part is...i dont even regret it 10/10",2
"nice game im online gamer adict i dont play dota 1 but when i try dota 2 its good",1
"one of the best free games ive played.part(not all) of the community is perty toxic but then again each game has its own bad players. overall its a sweet moba game to play and i do recommend giving it a try.",1

"pretyy awsome game, lost many many hours of my life to this game... i hope i make it through university.",5
"this game requires team work! well, we have a russian on our team. gg *leaves*",1
"ohh dota... how im glad i found you. i come from almost 600 hours of league of legends. and even though i never think i will get over the hours ive put in to league.i deffinetly think that dota was a gem covered in dust for me. i always thought this game was league but just more complicated and difficult. and it was xd. i felt like i was never even gonna figure out how to play. and here we are 118 hours later. and i dont have any regrets. so if you like the m.o.b.a genre even if your a lol,smite or even strife person i really think you should give dota a try. 7/10",1
"i used to hate strategy games. dota 2 was a hard game to get in to but i stuck with it and now it has clearly taken over my life. i love this game so much. the community isnt fantastic to start with - but as you gain more skill and you get put into games with people that are more experienced it becomes more enjoyable.",4
"i have spent more time with dota2 than any other videogame. having logged over 1.5k hours, i can say with confidence that dota2 is the most rewarding game that i have ever played. dota offers a sense of community and acomplishment unlike any other game. long 5v5 battles force players to communicate deeply - and winning these long battles makes the hard work even more rewarding. although the moba genre in general has a very steep learning curve, once immersed in the world, its hard to break out. dota2 is something of a magical videogame and amazing community packed into one f2p experience. thanks valve.",2
"wat u wan just a  badge leader telling me to do this ing",2
"this game is amazing! after seeing my brother playing dota 2, i immediately bought myself a higher spec computer and pc gaming gear just to play it! seeing dota 2 was the whole reason i signed up to steam in the first place! the game is extremely unique and original, with a host of amazing characters. the replay ability is amazing and neverending. i would very much recommend this game to anybody and everybody!",2

"good game with traning ur brain to team work. and one important thing, a pro dota2 player never scold people ks (kill steal) what will they think is the team kill is increasing, a step closer to the win",1
"dota 2 is cool, a game with a strategic mode it helps you to be strategized and think more about the game. a game that is always logic there no is no bad in this game this is game is more cooler because it is not just popular but this is the game which you can understand all the strategic and logical works of your life.",2
"warning: game contains content that will over-excite, enrage, cause loss of friendship, make you develop mental health problems, turn the most mild-mannered of people into obscenity spewing racists and make you doubt your abilities as a gamer in general. ruin your life today at the low low price of nothing! would definitly recommend.",1

"pretty good game if you want to lose friends and rage hard",1
"just play it and you will love it its that simple my friend :)",2
"amazing game to play when youre bored, or with a group of friends!",1
"free game, such complex, much competitive than the other moba games noob friendly lvl 999, right click left click, micro skillz wanna learn some russian and pinoy language ? this is the best place to go!",1
"i love the collaboration in this game .. but often i see the folder users hacked",1
"eu west server is not the russian server! its not even difficult to toggle it correctly and lower your ping, damn russians",1
"1000 different aspects to this game to master. all about stradegy using abilities, items, and techniques. there are over 100 different heros all with unique spells and abilities. this game however is all about taking your oppnenents ancient while working with your teamates. not the easiest game to learn by far but once you get warmed up its all your going to want to play 10/10",2

"this game is indeed a game. i went through many scientific studies to prove this. is it fun? probably not. im scared of playing it, frankly. 10/10",2
"a great pvp game that offers some of the most intriguing and nuanced team combat around.",2
"just play,teamwork,destroy tower,and you will be a winner!",1
"alright so unlike most people who dont recommend dota 2, i just legitametely did not like the game, though i understand how others would. dota 2 has similar gameplay to planescape torment, a game which i played for story aspects. i couldnt even get through the tutorial without feeling bored and unprogressive. in fact, the more i played the tutorial the less i understood. now i dont play many multiplayer games but from my experience the gameplay of dota 2 does not match its purpose, so if your like me, who enjoys games where you can see clear progression, you enjoy becoming stronger and stronger and are a fan of the wasd keys, i do not suggest it. 3.5/10",1
"great game, easier to understand than the 1st dota mod on warcraft iii. amazing animations, nice voice actors, and a lot of item choices for the heroes.",3
"wonderfull moba type of game. its a lot better than lol for me, graphics style is more appealing to adults than its competitor. id score it for 9,5/10 and recommended it to all players.",1
"do not download this game waste of tme if you ask me. if you are a magic-gamer then get it otherwise its a waste of time.",1

"rosetta stone in game form, but restricted to brazilian portuguese, russian, and korean.",1
"thanks to this amazing game, i can now fluently speak russian. /10 would reccomend",1
"this game has both enriched and destroyed my life, on one hand i dont have friends any more but that also means i have more time for dota 10/10",3
"frankly, i preferred the original defence of the asians, but this is still a worthy crowd-control simulator.",2
"since i began playing this game, i have become a far less social individual. ive lost friends and a sad excuse for a life, i didnt even notice the passing of my pet. i barely recognize my parents, and viceversa. the last president i remember is bush, the senior. all in all, great game 10/10",1
"fun game, once you find your hero. experimenting with each type is good, and just playing an ai battle with a few friends is a good way to pass the time.",1
"got called a  and was told to eat  and die. 10/10 will play again",1
"worst fps game ive ever played. 11/10 fedora = 0 swag = 0 i recommend it over skyrim, but stickman rpg is still better.",2

"pretty good game if you have aspergers. thats the only redeeming factor.",1
"dota 2 is an exeedingly deep and complicated game, you must delve deep into the lore and truly become the hero you are playing. only then will you be ready to defeat the magic lord.",4
"connecting to dota network all the time full of russian animals without brain",4
"do not even try to play this . well, if youre playing - finish. ruined my life.",4
"basically the best game ever.. just look at my hours played.",4
"this game improved so much since it was released on the beta. there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1. i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers. i know some people who play lol might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. its like comparing cod and battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",4
"im 24 hours in and still dont know what im doing 10/10",2
"good need more development on connection few actions against bad behaviour",4

"99% of players - 14 yo dumb fuqs 1% - divinely pleasant people. should play at least for them.",2
"a nice a very interesting game. hope that there are more new updates in this game. like it a lot.",1
"best game i have ever got sucked into i dont see myself stopping anytime soon. and with the massive pricepoint i dont see why any shouldnt try it.",5
"i got this game more for nostalgia than anything else. never really enjoyed defence of the ancient type games and at first it didnt seem like i would enjoy this either. the community may be fierce at times, especially when you are new but once you log a few hours and get the base mechanics under the knee the game and its community actually become pretty enjoyable. serves to provide many laughs and wtf moments and is best enjoyed in a party with people who will be willing to help you get through the first few games.",1
"as a dota 2 fan and an avid player of lol, i can say that the debate between which is better is moot. they are completely different playstyles and both have their own merits that make each game extremely addictive and enjoyable. dota 2 is exactly what us dota fans wanted it to be since back in the wc3 days. the community and the developers have made gameplay near perfection and the rest of the game system just keeps getting better as it evolves. i highlly recommend this game and theres no reason not to try it out, its free!",1
"recommended competitive game of action and strategy be a godlike with a rampage kill on there and youll feel an hours of fun",2
"very good in terms of gameplay. the graphics are on moderate scale which i think is a good thing sisnce not everyone could have high-end specs... the games in costant development and new patches come out quite often. however, the patching and issue solving problems still exist with valve. i would rate the game as 8.7/10",3
"a game about 10 random fairy-tale heroes thrown into a merciless battle for survival and the protection of their ancient, behind almost every hero theres a mighty russian who you can trust your life with. 10/10 over 6 russian servers to choose from all over the globe.",3
"deuta teu is a game made by volvo softwaree. vry good cntrls if you know russian. no ruski=bad day. 8/8 gr8 m8",1
"so much better and faster paced than boring league of legends.",1
"very addictive game. i spent a lot of my time with this game.",3
"the thing i regret doing most about my life is spending my time playing this game.",4
"it is better to have every level item drop coz its level is now useless",1
"if you are new to pc gaming or rts/moba games, dota 2 will appear as impenetrable as a wall. the learning curve for this game is by far the worst element of mobas. however, those of you with some experience with rts games or are willing to learn will find the teamplay experience of dota 2 an enjoyable. would recommend to anyone with a competent pc and drive to play competitively.",3
"this is a really good moba style game. it has good graphics and gameplay, although the community can be quite harsh - play with bots before you start playing vs other people.",2
"it is fun, for the first week of playing i feel like im in the best game in the world. great job of creating this game.",5
"o.k ive nearly played 800hrs of this sh*t game, dont get it...but when you win its its great :d if you dont mind the stress and heart problems this game comes bundled with and that it destroys friendships by all means download dota 2, that being said the stratergy and teamwork you need to preform flawless kills and team ganks on the enemy team is not easy but when done correctly and played as a team this game is truly a gem you will never find a game like this that gives you the satisfaction that the choices you make can change the game in a matter of seconds. p.s- the game does have a tutorial to get you going but if your new to the moba scene take the time to learn, watch guides becuase this game has quite a steep learning curve and quite a big selection of items to buy (it can be overwhelming to the new player), i recommend playing a few bot games before jumping into a match against other players.",2
"got 99 problems, micro-ing is one. there are very few games that allow me to hold my weinar while playing , dota is one of em . the innovative playstyle that i have been made new to allows for me to have free hand to generally cup my bawlz or hold my weinar, this breathtaking romance between my left hand and genitalia is phenominal towards the performance of my skills in dota , as well as this masterful technique i would reccomend this game. but you may ask yourself why isnt your left hand on the keyboard, as a connoisseur of stolen pc equipment i do not have the latest in razor technology or advanced moba gaming equipment therefore waisting a second hand on dota",1
"this game is the reason why we cant have nice things",5
"map update was bit disappointing. but all is great",2
"one of the best games ever made! it will make you ecstatic with joy, furious with rage. you will neglect your job, your family and sleep. and you will keep coming back for more punishment. and if thats not enough, you will stop watching tv because youd rather watch people stream dota on twitch (the competitive scene is very exciting and theres lots of great streamers out there, shout out to merlini, singsing and tc). gg go next.",4
"dota 2 is an amazing, exciting and outstanding online multiplayer team game. the concept art it self is amazing as well as the visuals, gameplay (which consists of mainly team work coardination and synergy with teammates) and easy to learn, but hard to master. i fully recommend this game to any one who enjoys strategy based team games.",2
"best game ever and always will be #dota2 #ti4 #prizepool",2
"do you have too much time on your hands? do you want to rage? well then dota2 is for you! not only does it waste your life and possibly make you flunk school, you get to learn russian and meet pinoys! enter the fascinating world off chasing donkeys, meeting brainless russians who say  blyat and kappa all day long. oh, i forgot the brazillians, they are pretty  too. so enter the world of dota2 and sell your life today!",2
"hi im the user of moii_ and was playing since dota , dota and dota2 were my favourite and only game im playing still. but unfortunately, my poor networking was drive me crazy cause im always being disconnected while playing. it caused me been abandoned more than 10 matches. i wasnt what i meant. can you please help me on this to clear the poor abandoned record of this incident? appreciate for your response.. thanks advanced.",1
"do you know what meth is? dota 2 is the exact same thing you come out losing teeth, paying people for things you dont need, seemingly twitch for no reason whatsoever, and you become racist to every living thing ever created... yup that sums up dota 2 in a nutshell. have fun playing guys.",2
"when i first started dota 2 my brain had downs, i had no idea what i was doing at all... but i soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying and the learning the heroes (all heroes are free!). before i knew it, i was performing better and better. i focused and kept learning little by little and bingo! i got pretty good. you will encounter a lot foreigners good or bad but most of them can understand english. theres a lot of great people in the game and some are trolls and jerks but its fun . i recommend this game for everybody! if you play lol stop, unistall, and play dota 2. that game is canerous especially its community has grown to filth i played since 2009 it was a great moba for many years until this game came out and perfected the orignal one(warcraft iii mod). its really hard at first i know that but give it a try and learn.",1
"great game for those who like to play moba genre. recommended to all.",1
"dont be angry when you loose, because of the words bobo or putang inang in your team,there is a high chance of loosing.",2
"i couldnt wait to start playing dota 2 when it was first announced because i used to play dota when it was a custom map on warcraft iii. it really is a fun game to play. especially if you play it with friends! the community could be a little better as there are quite a few people that dont seem to understand that this, is infact a game and people will make mistakes. new as older players.",2
"love the game so addictive. mostly friendly people on there a few idiots but thats to be expected all in all really good",1
"overall its not bad - a bit boring, but then again so am i also,  cyka stop feed noob ajaja xaxaxaxa 11/10",2
"this game may have its ups and downs but in all its an amazing game that has made my life easier. one way is that i learned the new wonderful language of russian, although the only word i know so far is , im sure it will help me get a job later in life. just calling my would be boss a  in russian would deffinatly increase my chances of getting said job.",3
"the most fun you can have on a free game, bar none. the community is great (most of the time) and replayablity is endless. just download it already!",2
"already more than tousand hours during with teammates, friends, russians, and some others from whole world gamers ranked/public matches...find it a answer wich hero are the best, propably cant answered, the game so perfect, spend lot of time, so many heros...learn mechanics every hero needs a time...teamplay game, 1 man on war is nothing.",3
"dota 2 is like driving a car. (they have similar intensity) you have to look at minimap like wing mirrors you have to look at chat like looking rear-view mirror the more intense game becomes, is like the more you drive into big city or complex places in rush hours the less you know about what each hero can do or how the game play, is like not knowing roads/streets or even shortcuts ****if you dont care about winning (zero percent), then it is like you driving a trashy car and crash to other cars and you simply run away. (you just might got caught)***** the game is full of possibilty and it is well balanced. but its just that most people just like to driving to some same places rather than the rest of the places because its easier reach the destination without stress.",2

"okay well about two years after my first review i thought it was a good time to revisit this. this is by far the bestfree game out there(i have spent too much money on tourney tickets and .) and any of you losers still playing league of legends really need to take a step back and think about your life. are you ever going to take off the training wheels and step up your game? probably not, because youve become too used to babys first dota and the thought of having access to all the heroes is too daunting and youd rather only have the small pool of free heroes to select from. because you dont like having fun. and you like spending money on things that should have been free from the start. if you dont want to buy cosmetics or tourney tickets then all this game will cost you is your sanity and your faith in the human race. 11/10 would sacrifice firstborn to continue to play",4

"dota 2 is a moba in which you dont need big bucks to be better than anyone else. a new player is just like an old player with the only differenece being the experience. the game is balanced to a very high degree and has a lot of tournements with stupidly large prize pools. the heroes are fun and unique, and the mechanics are great. in my opinion it is the best game in this genre so far.",3

"dota 2 for me has set the standard for mobas. the level of detail gone into this is brilliant. the characters are well thought out with hilarious quotes and rivalry with the combat being fluid and fast paced. the only downside to this that i would say is the matchmaking. there is a steep learning curve when it comes to playing proficiently and already seasoned players do not take lightly to new players. beware of this, and if this kind of stuff doesnt phase you then match-make away!",2
"if you like strategic teamplay games, this is the best choice for you.",4
"as the moba genre began to rise to the spotlight of the gaming community. i decided to give it a try. i first tried league of legends, but was yelled at for being a noob and rage quitted. i thought this kind of behavior was counter-productive, because a gaming commmunity should be supportive of noobs....because even the gaming legends start as noobs as some point in their career. so i got frustrated, and didnt touch mobas for a while. however, im in deep love in valve and everything they do, so when i heard about dota, i got interested. when i completed the tutorial, and finally joined a game, everyone was helpful and willing to assist a noob to a very complicated and intricate genre. i still suck, as i play off a kind of beginners intinct and not off of a knowledge of the game. however, dota, with its compelling art style, helpful community, and a touch of gaben, blew lol out of the water for me.",1

"if you cant afford to purchase cocaine to lighten up your weekend then dota 2 is the next best thing! highly addictive and as equally life destroying as any drug, dota 2 will make you question your own sanity and send you on a spiralling quest about what the meaning of life actually is (answer could be dota 2). if you cant speak russian then dota 2 will enable you to become fluent in the language but only if you put some effort in yourself. this means that holiday to russia youve all been wanting will be like visiting home, rather than a foreign country. learn great words like  and  and repeat them to your new friends! ive never felt more free than when i play dota 2, im sure my life span decreases every time i play it so whats not to love! go buy it now for free and ruin your life! play with friends so you can venture the darkness together! 11/10 must buy, very win.",1

"a wonderous 5 lane world of 20 kill supports, 1 v 5 heroics and lost russians. each game guarantees: -a noob who does exactly the opposite of what the team suggests, this is a great time to practise reverse psychology. -at least some form of russian, be it english players that enjoy their newly learned dialect or a genuine player of russia who due to their 3rd world conditions are obviously too famished to actually play the game properly. -a pudge pro that insists on mid and then deems it a great time to showcase exactly how not to attempt to hook players for all of 27 minutes while the other steam rolls you entirely. -a support with a dagon. with numerous repetition of the line but i thought he was getting away while he is now 4 levels above the medusa right next to him. in summary this game will make you very... very... angry. a lot of the time. i cant go a single day without playing it.",3

"this game is totally free, meaning that you have to pay nothing to get the full experience. also, there are better items to find than just some dinky old hats from team fortress 2. if you arent going to do anything productive anyway you might as well earn some items that you can trade.",2
"you will start of fresh , not knowing what to do and then constantly being yelled at by someone for reason you do not why. then you will slowy catching up to know more and more and the feeling of winning a game will become very fun and then very addicted. then, after seeing so many others not knowing what you know...you will slowly change into a horrid creature.... the very soul-sucking creature that once slander you when you were just a young dota 2 player..... great game 5/5",3

"this game made me racist-nazi lover who hates russians and any other person who uses moonrunes for communication. i hope our savior adolf will resurrect and facerape them or simply just cut their internet connections :3. i saw a pudge who stayed in mid lane for all game, a furion who didnt use minions for push, a bloodseeker who bought black king bar and didnt use it and all of these people are russians. i think putin uses them for make next generation neurotic. #yay #racism #nazi #hate #thanksobama #",2

"one of the most addictive games ive played, at first you rage at the game because its a very difficult game to play. but a spark flys and you absoloutly love it!. only flaw at the time of this recommendation is that the report system is a bit...rough... but please bare in mind this is still only a beta and things will improve!! if you want a team based game this game if for you! each hero has their own strength and weaknesses, there are different roles, carry, support, nuker are to name just a few of the many skill builds that you can choose on one of the heroes you may pick. i would give this 9.5/10 because of the trolls that you encounter in game, who report you for not talking russian on and english speaking server.",4

"if you want to loose your social life, play this game.",2
"if youre going to spend any time playing either this and/or league of legends, this is a far more interesting use of your time. here are a list of pros and cons: pros: -heroes have integrity and character -hats -carries dont build the same things as each other -there is no designated jungler role -game mechanics dont change to accommodate bad players -game mechanics dont change to accommodate immature players -volvo -holiday themed game modes in which you can obtain hats -game mechanics dont change to accommodate whiny players -hat trading -gaben -victories are highly satisfying -the game is highly cerebral -half-life 3 confirmed -also, hats cons: -the matchmaking system is suspicious -russians not playing on the russian servers as you can see, the pros clearly outweigh the cons. by this metric, you should most definitely play this hat simulator, i mean, game.",1

(no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",1

"one of the highest skill curves and least forgiving, nay, worst communities ive ever endured in a game. ive been told to quit playing altogether multiple times by strangers in what i understand is essentially the norm for this game. yet i continue to play it because i find the successes and the depth of strategy within the game to be rewarding enough to push past all that. this is in no small part due to my friends, who have given me a chance to learn. and i vow to never turn into one of these champion s.",1
"its a great game which will take you a long time for you to get bored with. the gameplay is solid and you can play for years and still learn new things. the only problem with the game is the toxic community, make good use of the mute and report buttons!",4

"before trying out dota 2, i did not really like moba overall. until my friends persisted that i tried and i was glad i made that choice. dota 2 is a great game that really requires teamwork(like every moba), but it just has this special feel that makes this f2p game a must play. it has awesome graphics and smooth mechanics and one should definitely not miss out on this game.",2

"seriously, ive gone from paying heroes of newrth to league of legends to dota and the only game ive stuck to playing constantly out of the three is dota. i find it easier than hon but more challenging than league. i have no major glitches like i did when i played league and i love all the heroes that can be played. ive gotten quite a few of my friends to either pick dota 2 back up or to start playing it. like any other game you run into a few rude players but otherwise the community is great. i highy recommend this to anyone looking for a game to play like league or hon!",1

"i will recommend this game to all players that are true fans of good rpg games :)",5
"well its got a brick wall as a learning curve, and a not very cohesive tutorial; i still cannot figure out how to jump. but once you finally start to get a grasp of the game you realize that the community is horrendous, not only will they yell at you but 20% of the time they wont even understand your language! overall all the non-game mechanics mechanics are stupidly terrible. 10/10",3

"xaxaxaxa. very nice russian learning programm. would bang. 10/10",3
"there is only one word that can describe this game: amazing! dota is the ultimate moba experience offering a large variety of well balanced heroes, suitable for any kind of player. every match has different teams that require different tactics to defeat. i like it how valve isnt greedy, as every cosmetic item in the game can be obtained by simply playing it. actually, the best items in the game can be obtained like this, considering that the shop offerst mostly uncommon items, that are available for a limited period. the only thing i dislike about this game is that sometimes people take it too seriously and forget to enjoy it. if you liked this review then feel free to give me free stuff.",3
"its an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. it took me a long time to warm up to, but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. if you can spare the time - play it.",2

"if youre a veteran moba player, dota2 shouldnt be unknown to you. it is the best one out there after all. but if youre new to the genre, dota 2 is the most beginner friendly moba as of right now. it offers practise spacing from walking around, to buying items, to last-hit creeps and destroy towers. when youve learned the basics, you can practise against bots. you can play either with bots or with actual players to practise playing with a team.",3
"i have spent around 1,500 hours in this game. enough said.",5

"nice game but need fix in bot match. please make the bot more harder so i can enjoy play the game",1
"the latest in rage simulation technology. dota 2 is supposed to be a team game but plays like call of duty where your team is full of little kids, non-english speaking players and people who play like they are using a trackpad. what is supposed to be a objective based game turns into a team deathmatch if you get matched with russians. valve constantly releases patches to try and balance the handicap that peruvians give you but its not working, what seems like a 5v5 match in reality is a 8v2 or 9v1. i do not recommend this game unless you like getting angry at yourself for not being able to win a 9v1",5
"dota 2 is a game about teamplay and skill. i really like it cause of that and i reccomend it to everyone who enjoys teamplay games.",3
"this game is pretty fun. this game requires lots of time (about 15-60 minutes, depending on momentum) and requires tactics with your teammates to make comebacks or push on deeper to enemy lines. this is a good, free game that i recommend to my friends. also, make sure to watch free to play because the movie is perfect with this game (like wine with some foods).",1
"i like all the new and good features of this game. i hope there are more improvements to this game. i just dislike that when it has new features of the game the size also go up.",2
"the most engrossing game i have ever played. i started playing the game thinking that i probably wouldnt like it and would stop after a game or two. 300+ hours later here i am, still improving and still learning all the subtleties of the game that only experience can give you. a very steep learning curve requires you to play several games before you can even get the basic mechanics down, not to mention the hours it will take to learn the nuances of all the heroes and items, and how they interact with each other. once you can get past the initial wall, it is a game that can be played for hours on end, and doesnt seem to have an end in sight, as its gameplay seemingly will carry on years into the future. plus its free, so why not?",1
"i totally recommend this game to anyone it is a great game and very addictive what i found was it was easy to learn and understand how to work the controls so any newcomer can play but also is very hard to keep you on the edge of your seat. i would change 2 things and many people will agree so if you are looking at this dota 2 makers ;) we would love for you to be able to let us zoom out so we can see more as it is a pain and really hard to keep eyes on your character without dying and also please make it so you can choose for the camera to follow your player so we dont have to do that but overall amazing game but they are the only cons. great game",1
"a very addictive game that will take over your life with its incredibly fun playstyle",2
"the most addicting thing in the world. i dont know what sort of masochistical urge is making us play this game over and over again. overall 10/10!",4

"i like heroes in this game. its amazing, especially women heroes, so beautifull. but i dislike most is met with troll player make the game lose",2
"firstable this game is the best moba for me, i played since dota 1. its a perfect game, that combines your skills, with cooperation of 5, and above all using your head and moves correctly.",3
"overall id say its not that bad. little different from league but still fun enough. however my steam friend mwacky is too stuck in his ways to try it and the moment he started doing poorly in a bot game just quit. he is a big .",1
"i like this game because of the graphics. it so fun i love playing dota because when im playing dota im so happy =)",1
"things i gave to dota: 1. money 2. time 3. love things dota gave me: 1. arthritis 2. carpal tunnel syndrome 3, hatred of russians, mexicans, spanish, finnish, and russians 4. broken keyboard 5. broken mouse 6. 9/10 ready 7. server crashes 8. 4 stacks of russians in euw servers on english prefrence settings 9. ranked matches 10. free to play but pay to win games (i.e. - foreseers contract, new bloom 2015) 11. its in the bag spam (especially skywrath) 12. multilingual cursing - i guess this is a good thing? 13. split second math - reliable/unreliable gold and gold loss on death vs. buyback availability - this is good too essentially - dota is a greedy woman, but i love her all the same. 11 / 10 would play again",5
"the chance of having a russian or more in one game is the same as waking up in the morning.",1
"the game can be played at any skill level but the beauty is that at higher levels there is so much depth that no two games are ever alike. the only issue is that it is difficult to improve without having someone (friendly) better than you who will actively call out your mistakes; in dota 2, ignorance is not bliss.",1
"dota isnt a game , it is a lifestyle for those who had enough brain to live in this world !",4
"goodest game every made and u have so many frends 2",2
"awesome time killer. cant stop playing. im havin a giggle m8",1
"this is very high quality game. graphics are very detailed and good. but still, you can play on low quality and enjoy. the thing about this game is, that while starting , you wait too much time : match searching and player waiting. players often fail to connect. second thing, if you like rpg games, the fact that someone can be first and take the hero that you like, want will be terrible. and to be short, if you dont have enough free time to spend (40 min-1hour) on match, dont start it, if you leave , you wll recieve abandon and ruin your teams game (butin reality no one knows is it ruining or helping , couse in late game, money is everything and your money will be spreaded between your teammates). so yea you should try this game if you like competition and sometimes rage :)",1
"have you ever wondered how you could finally learn more about russia and its interesting culture? well wonder no longer, with this great game you can learn everything there is to know about the russians, they will happily teach you their language, culture and differences compared to western culture. so what are you waiting for? davay davay davay",3

"its like chess but in real time where you need to play with other people in team of 5 players and you can controll only one hero (with few exceptions) which u choose from big pool of units. each figure has its own advantages and weakness some can counter others but they are countered by different hero",2
"/10, would rather touch a feminists hand and thats saying something",1
"the best game ever for multiplayer and strategy so play this game and dont ask me why because why the hell no?",2
"really addictive and awesome game. but you have to play it with friends. without them you will be constantly facing rage, vulgarisms and insults from the horrible community (doesnt really matter if they are in your or enemy team).",2
"the game teaches you many things such as team work, strategy, charecter build and russian. it causes you to be racsit towards any 1 who dont speak english, gets you angry when some one is playing as riki, drow ranger and sniper. side effects: hatered to russians, masive reduce in sleep hours, paranoia for pink smoke, anger and racsisem. 10/10 would buy if it was not free.",1
"after u play all kinds of games, u will find out that dota is the best",2
"learn how to swear in russian and several other languages in the very diverse and tolerant gaming community that dota 2 posseses. you will learn how to pick fault with minute aspects of another persons play style just because they have annoyed you in chat, and repeatedly chant report pls against somebody who doesnt help you solo the whole enemy team. you will be suprised by the proportions of russian-speaking-only people living in in western europe and north america. this game nurtures a hate of russian and generally non-english speaking people and enables you to make racist and bigoted comments to people you bear no prejudice against what-so-ever. so addictive. must play!",2
"aside from random hating and the odd slap  its not too shabby. no you...",1
"great game at first,but since a certain update about 3 months ago, game is lagging like crazy, got 600 ping and the fps meter shows 30 but it feels like 5,also every actions have a 5 second delay for some reason.higly recommand to wait until this gets fixed before playing.as for me im never playing this game again.",1
"riki is a dirty little gy-po who constantly s you in the  with his tiny  hands. drow must give the whole of the dota production team blow jobs for them not to just straight up remove the op  from the ing game. was infected by the valve crate plauge off the bat, so make sure you have your wallet out. overall a great game- gato 10/10 goty plz valve",2

"nothing further to say. a great game and free to play. many funny moments as well as the competitiveness in dota 2",4
"dota 2 is a great game, it really test your team skills.",2
"most addictive competivite strategy game out there. love what theyve done in terms of updating dota to a more modern, smoother feeling game.",3
"a combination of great game mechanics and compelling hero backstories make dota 2 a cut above other multiplayer online battle arenas (mobas) such as league of legend and dota 1. of particular interest to new and old players alike is the hero mirana and her trademark w-button ability, sacred arrow, which when successfully deployed is often considered one of the most fatal not-ulti moves in the game. when not utilising this 360-damage 5-second stun, players may take solace in miranas other special abilities such as leap, a devastatingly evasive jump, starstorm, a powerful aoe magical damage dealer, and her notorious ultimate moonlight shadow which will render all heroes on miranas team invisible at the click of a button. whilst dota 2 does not necessarily revolve around the ever-popular hero mirana at this time, many hope to one day see her in an online action/adventure of her very own.",2
"will ruin your life while making you miserable at the same time. but inbetween that, you wont find a game better than this.",4
"lot of fun..but some people in game like to insult each others and lot of racism..",2
"dota 2 is like chess if someone makes the wrong move your team loses the game. it requires a lot of practice to become avarage player. anyway the game very good it gets new updates every month sometes new items and new upgrades for the heros are released its balanced game. i think that valve should release the 3 remaining heroes just to normal match makeing public only first and then maybe on ranked mmr",2
"first 100 hours......get called noob,feeder and useless after 300 hours.... started to call them noob,feeder and useless great game!!!!",2

"a good game like dota 1 .. but dota 2 has much better graphics :d",2
"i have played this game since 6 years. and i have never found any other game equivalent to the fun and frustration it gives me.",3
"this game is very multifunctional because you can play and same time you can learn russian language. no matter how server you choosed , russians are everywhere !!! maybe you will say  okaaaaay stop ! i go play on servers of the north america !  so you find the match in the north america , join , and three russians will greet you with  cy ka blyat davay .. and that is dota 2. keywords of dota are:  russians are everywhere !

"when you start playing dota 2, you soon begin to realize that its a black hole. the money in your steam wallet will slowly dwindle away, and youll suddenly have 20 of the same item in your inventory and a receipt for hundreds of chests. not even light can escape the black hole of dota 2. dota 2 is love, dota 2 is life. 10/10 would recommend.",1
"dota 2 is more better about the visual and effect...!",2
"a 6 or 7 line review just wont do this game justice. dota 2s learning curve is pretty steep but once you learn the basics, which can take 5 to 15 matches, its rewarding experience thats all about teamwork and playing your role correctly. dota 2s social features are cutting edge and designed for great casual, hardcore and competitive play. the controls are tight and responsive while dedicated servers on multiple locations allow for almost no noticeable latency. its free to play but people wont use their wallets for tactical advantage because all items are purely cosmetic. really impressive game and my personal game of the year 2013.",2
"if i had a nickle for every time a russian came on the server or when im threatend to get a report, i could pay for world peace -10/-69",3
"its a really good game, with good mechanics and good graphics. at first, it is boring, but when you practice and start understanding the game, it becomes a pleasure every time. all the matches seem like theyre the same but theyre not. its a different game every match, with tactics and fun. 10/10. ps: there are russians.",2

"dota 2 is dota on a new engine. if i was to compare it only to its predecessor it is the whole package. you get the game that you loved with the beauty of the source engine. if you come from playing other newer moba style games this is the granddaddy of those games reborn. and hey, free to check out if it is for you or not. so there is that too.",1

"killed my cat because he screwed me up in a fight. 10/10 would spend money",3
"this is by far the best and most intensive game i have ever played. 10/10 and would recommend this to anyone.",4
"dota 2. better than lol or hon by almost every extent possible in my opinion. the graphics are beautiful, you can deny, slower pace gameplay, more impacts when you die. all of them have a problem with their community. you get everything for free and only have to pay for announcers, hero skins, and other stuff that only affects looks. not pay to win. its play to win. get it now. its free. the reason people dont like dota 2 over lol is because its too slow and harder for them or because it has a higher skill curve.",1

"awesome fun, definitely the best choice for any aos (moba) gamers out there in my personal opinion.",3

"when i first started dota2 i was a little overwhelmed, as my first arts/moba game it was pretty complicated. i soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. before i knew it, i was performing  and better. i stopped making silly  and  got vastly better at not  the enemy . for the  part, everyone ive met was very helpful and , there  the   however. as  - play dota2    ,  ,     .      ! not my words, but still relevant. you tend to learn some spanish and russian due to the amount of people who speak those languages in the english queues. good game, fast paced and intuitive, loads of fun. valve makes sure that this game continues to grow within its boundaries, by adding season-specific events and new cosmetics as often as possible.",2
"if you look past all of the occasional angry russians/brazilians, youll learn to love it and eventually become a mindless tool whos purpose is to buy sets for heroes you never play and craft your inventory to death. 10/10 like skyrim with an overhead view",2

"the best moba of all time. the history behind this game is, well, insane. icefrog, the mysterious legend. league of legends sprouting basically from the first version. the teams in the esports scene. dota 2 lounge, for commited betters of esports dota 2 teams. trading cards. enjoying the hours upon hours spent with friends met just dominating every match that you can. the thrill of playing new heroes and somehow feeling as if the same map is always filled with new challenges. this is a game that you just cant debate about. this is probably the best game i have played besides counter strike. another winner for valve.",5

"dota 2 is incredibly fun, although it may not seem so when youre sitting through that awfully slow paced tutorial, and your first few games may seem overwhelming. tough it out, its worth it. once you learn to play a hero or two and you know a couple items to go with those heroes, youll do fine. dota will show you that the only thing you were missing in your life is being screamed at by people in russian/porteguese despite you already make it clear that you only speak english. pro tip: no, playing on us servers does not solve this problem, apparently every russian/portuguese speaking person decided to play on us servers despite the awful ping and they dont know the mainstream language here.",1
"dota 2 is an awesome game,, play with your friend and get more fun :)",3
"probably one of the best free games out there. i cant think of a good reason not to play it. the learning curve is steep, but once you get the hang of the items, skills, and characters theres a lot to enjoy here. it may be frustrating at times, but when you get a good team together and start pulling off some awesome game-saving maneuvers, its hard not to love it.",1

"this game should replace the un. all races play together in relative peace",4
"dota 2 is, in my eyes, the best game ever made. if it werent for the overbearing ignorance of the people that play this game, that thrive only on making others angry with said ignorance. this game could have been so much more. that being said, i recommend you get a few of your friends together to play with you. if you can get a group of 3-5 people to play this with. there is no better game. win or lose, my friends and i have a blast every game. showing off our skilled plays and laughing at each others blunders. unfortunately if you are a lone gamer, you will end up with that same type of person in your group often. that one guy that cant play to have fun. his idea of fun is to have the whole team verbally abusing someone for a single mistake for an entire hour long game. that being said, i would give this game a 9/10. the one point deduction due to the moba community being a bunch of *ssholes.",4

"a new player could find quick chat wheel usefull.... but someone who played this game long enough will know that everything he needs is >!",2
"like almost any other moba out there, its free unless you want any of your looks customized. i only played a handful of matches, and being at least semi-literate in both moba uis and old custom warcraft and starcraft maps, i can in no way recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore of moba fans. the ui is unintuitive, the shop is a mess to look at if youre new, and you will likely get your face smashed in by even the computer-controlled players time and time again while you punishingly learn every little thing it takes to be good at this game. if you have never played a moba, if you dont have a friend who already plays this and can walk you through what to do, do not try this game. if you really love mobas and are looking for a new one, yes, definitely try this and i hope you enjoy it. i did not, not even remotely.",1

"a rts game which play by 10 players,divided by 2 teams ( radiant and dire) this game is so excited because of there are so many heroes which their skills are so variants,such as stun,kill,healing,disabling and so on. dota is the game like chess and soccer, because you must use strategy to defeat your enemy,not just kill,looking for gold. for amateurs this game can use build help if the amateurs dont know what item must they build. remember,in this game you must be patient and cooperative when your teammates doing some fault because in this game there are winner and losser,the way you prove that you are pro is by cover up your teammates. i very reccomend this game not only just a guy can play this game,also a girl like me can also play too. end of my talk, i love dota2",2

"this game is so great. needed the combination of strategy, teamworks, skills, and solo ability. its make the game so interesting. besides that the hero pool is so many and every heroes have different skills that we must understand and mastered before we use a hero. knowledge is important to play this game not only righ clicking the enemy but also using your intelegent for make enemys team down without cause losing the teammates.",1

"game used to be fun but is full of 11 year olds and russians. they need to fix the game also just play lol.",1
"i have to admit its a pretty fun game, after playing it for a while, it really does feel like most of the heroes are completely unbalanced. if youre going against an experienced team or even higher difficulty bots, youre bound to struggle and get frustrated. im kind of on and off with this game, but i uninstalled and really dont feel like playing again. new players are going to find this game hard to play, especially when matched with more experienced players, it takes time to even figure out what to do most of the game after starting and before ending. everyone should at least try it!",1

"i recommend this game for does want strategy game and teamplay",3
"very confusing even if you think you know a bit about mobas from playing league of legends. not recommended for people with no patience. i think this game is more complex and league of legends even if it feels a little less responsive. definitely a higher skill ceiling as well. fun if you can get into it, frustrating and anger-inducing if you cant.",1
"reviews for dota 2:rosetta stone for gamers - if you hate russia, think league of legends is too mainstream, and have a lot of time to waste, this is the game for you. - best language learning tool ever especially for the following languages: portugese, russian, and every language in the entire eu! - i didnt know valve made language games.... - before dota 2, my friends called me a wannabe hipster, but now im a genuine hipster, unlike all of those lol playing imbeciles",1

"i looked up the wikipedia page on psychological abuse and dota fits it almost to the letter. 10/10 emotional and mental abuse. this game will keep you from meeting social obligations. enjoy meeting people from around the world as they all cuss at you in various languages, including spanish and russian. but that shouldnt really be a problem since team communication is almost nonexistent. if you play willingly play support you are 1/10 in the game almost always, even if they have support on their team theyll go semicarry at the minimum. enjoy your stay, , game is hard, noob, they gave diretide, trading keys, you forgot to ward again, dont buy boots first",4

"dota 2 is a very intensive video game that is just as good as league of legends, although it is somewhat lacking in its misogynistic protrayal of women, where all the female heroes are highly sexualized and often oppressed by the patriarchal standards of the game. there is only one strong female character (both metaphorically and literally), named legion commander, and even she is highly sexualized and often the target of pornographic parodies. although they are perfectly equal in the terms of gameplay, valve has quite a ways to go before they reach the same plethora of well-characterized and non-sexualized female characters as riot games managed to do in league of legends. therefore, although the game is reasonably fun, i cannot honestly recommend it to any mature gamers out there.",1

"its an awesome game, have a lot of strategy in different kinds of heroes and youll surely enjoy it.",1
"ive spent over 9000 hours on the original dota, and even though dota 2 is very similar and extremely fun to play, the lack of heros is a turn off for me. not only that, but the game is highly addictive and can pretty much ruin your life if you cant controll your will to play this 24x7x365.",1

"this game is simply one of the masterpiece of our era. this game require you a lot of time- in order to play rightly. do not play this game if you have lack of will, because to be honest the community is not that good. and some of them usually blame even if they dont play good. but trust me once you get friends, this game is one of the greatest game that combine strategy, synchronization, and also providing amazing gaming experience at the same time. if you like a game that asking you to act spontaneously in real time while demanding for strategies at the same time. this game is made for you. 10/10 for me. never get enough since 6 year ago, since the defense of the ancient:allstars era :)",3
"the best way to have fun and laugh with friends and/or the best way to become racist and/or just hate people. until you learn how to play, you will get the sweetest beating from russians probably, but as you play along you will be part of the hate community, eventually, my advice as any other who played the first dota, learn with bot matches the heroes, afterwards go in the vs players match section. you might get shouted and screamed at and called noob if you screw the match up. if you experience such things, do not worry, you are on the right way of being addicted to it as the rest ofthe crew. have fun & good luck! ps: there are girls that play the game, most of the time you will hear them on the voice chat ;)",2
"dota 2 is a game that is made due to the amount of  flooding league of legends. it is an autistic turn based game where the main goal is to run out of cards fastest. there are many champs or as dota 2 likes to call them heroes. other than the fact that it is pay to win it is run on the half-life engine which is really amazing seems though the game developers were monkeys. there are some side quests you can do like stealing children and selling drugs my main hero is a ork warrior i am lvl 69. do i reccomend this game you may ask well it depends whether or not you want hiv/aids",1

"this game has given me tourettes syndrome and made me into a racist. it destroys the last possibility of you seeing female breasts ever again, and it definitely ruined my life. 10/10 would recommend",1
"this game, like most moba games, is like an abusive partner, it will hurt you and make you feel awful so you tell yourself you will stop yourself and that you will put an end to the relationship but when you confront it it pulls you close and whispers in your ear while gently carressing your back that it is sorry for hurting you so you forgive it and the cycle continues. great game",1

"its fun and i have more than 1000hrs of gameplay and never get bord of it its, really fun and the intrercartion with other players really helps the game to keep going to greater distances. oh btw one thing when having special events it would be great if you guys could give free random items on a freaquant basis to the players taking part in it it would be a great moral boost apart from that nothing much to complain keep up the good work guys.",2
"steep learning curve, but once you invest the time to not suck then it is a pretty addictive and fun game. the teamwork aspect of it is what makes it and/or breaks it if you are unlucky to be paired with a feeding player. that said, if you can find a small core of people that you consistently play with then win or lose it is a pretty awesome game. oh, and dont use riki or sniper unless you have to. just trust me.",3

"i absolutely love dota 2 and would reccoment it to any serious gamer espedcially fans of warcraft three dota and other multiplayer online battle arena (moba) games like league of legends or heroes of newerth (blatent ripoff of dota). of course valve and steam make the game easy to run and the community is fantastic. 5 out of 5 stars.",2
"ive been a lover of dota since the allstar days. used to take extreme pride in my .wc3 dota files...had quite a few. let me tell you people that ive played a lot of games and this is the only one that makes my heart pound out of my chest. not every match of dota 2 spikes my adrenaline but when it does happen it makes all the hard times way more than worth it. this game is not for the weak. it is for those who will stop at nothing to achieve victory. this aspect extendes beyond the 1010001001s right into the human psyche.",2

"it takes like 80 hours before you reach the stage where if you screw up, you will know why and can learn from it. once youre there, though, its really really fun. my greatest advice to new players: please dont try using meepo, even though he has a funny face. also, kunkka is the bane of your eixistence early game when youre new. other than that, when youre in a game, the little book thing in the top left contains community guides that will light up which skills you should get in order. wish someone told me that when i started out.",1

"an interesting proposition. unlike most games, this is the gift that keeps on giving. over the lifetime of dota 2 many additions have been made, and many continue to come along. dota 2 is based on an old warcraft mod, and on a weekly and monthly basis, valve continues to update and add features to the game. aside from being a lucrative scene for competitive gamers, it also has a steep learning curve and endless combinations as far as team compisitons go. if you arent the kind of person who likes to play versus other players, the game allows you to play cooperatively against bots. and to further add to the lifespan of the game, the developers release festive events every 3-5 months to add something extra for players to do. as the game is free to play, this game can potentially net you some gains in the form of the marketable items you recieve for playing.",2

"this game man this game is totally awesome. firstly its free. and its total fun. also its not a pay to win game. ive been a fan of dota during warcraft itself but dota 2 is more amazing. this game requires you to have alot of patience and determination. yes there is customization in this games and yes you have to buy the items. but u also get items each time when level( this is a for sure getting) and u also might get an item by chance after each game. u can also sell the items u get. in total this game is spectacular.",4

"the worst and best game on the world at the same time",3
"i find it amusing because id actually say that dota2 is a bit easier. to deny, just right-click. league, you actually have to plan ahead and play significantly more cleverly to deny, predict your enemys backing/roam more and be able to clear waves to use the tower instead. the mind games play a much larger role, as well as efficient use of skills, rather than just buying hard-counter items to match a given situation. the trouble is, it /looks/ simpler at first glance, while actually offering far more depth, strategy and complexity. so those who play at a low level never actually see anything more than simplified gameplay, and quickly go back to d2 or hon. and nothing of value was lost.",3

"a very competitive game... you only play on 1 map though.. but you wont get bored with tons of playable heroes..",5
"current meta sucks, next meta will probably suck just as well. this game is better off you recognizing every aspect of the game and getting used to the learning curve, play 600-2000 hours, get mad at it, and fanboy over professional teams. fanboying and following professional teams and tournaments is the best way to go. also the lore isnt half bad. tl;dr this game is better than league of ies",1

"the best moba game!!! 10/10 sometimes you just cant stop playing it.... its like never-ending adventure in the same place and the same time, but its different. why? 1. more that 100 heroes to choose from; 2. 5 hero combination on dire and radient team; 3. every hero has a big selection of visual customizations; 4. 10 game modes to play and events!! but sometimes you will stop playing. why? 1. russians.",3
"its a wonderful yet brutal experience which leaves you with a strange love-hate feeling for it, like any worth while relationship does. for veterans from warcraft 3 mod days will fell quite nostalgic and really appreciate the up scaling done to the game. newcomers will still have a sense of how detailed the game is, both graphically and game mechanics wise. at its core its an rpg through and through with leveling systems, items and fixed hero abilities. the community still needs to grow in terms of mannerism but anyone with thick skin can power through the nasties, which arent that many anyway.",4

"so as of now ive spent 500hrs ish on this game. i would honostly have to say that this is the best game ive played hands down. i love how fluid the game is with all the heroes, items, and ever changing battle situations. i enjoy how fair the matchmaking system is and how this is a non pay to win game. no item you buy in store can give you an advantage over enemy heroes, besides looks. people will say some heroes are over powered, but in reality its just how the dice roll. hope you enjoy it as much as i have",2

"the most challenging and engaging moba, warning to lol players there is a steep learning curve and you need to unlearn a lot of habits. all attack animations are not designed to last hit, making it actually take skill. meanwhile the game is all about skill, activatable items and always being able to comeback if youre diligent and knowledgable. its about crushing defeat that sinks to your core, and triumphant victory that makes you yell to the skies!",4

"you will never be good at this game, you will merely be less bad. it is fun trying to be less bad though.",4
"a good twist on a mmo mostly focused on strategy. this game is playable by a wide range of players due to its different playing style for each character. whether you are a supporter role for a team or the leader or the pusher. all of them offer unique gameplay styles. the objective though rather simple is rather hard to achieve in fact and can lead you to racking your brains to think of the best way to destroy the enemies base. this game forges camarderie among players as each player in the team have to work with each other and support each other with the different skillsets they each have. i strongly recommend you trying this game for a classic game twisted into something fresh and renewed, its worth a try and most certainly will find a playing style in there to suit you.",1
"this game is utter shiet. i have a frend who plays this game and he is annoying. therefore through simple logic this game must be bad i would rate 4/20 cuz it honestly makes me feel like my  becomes prolapsed every time i play it",1
"good game, but it is worth remembering that this is just a game!",4
"it took me about a year to know that i just lost 1 year of my life for this game, it is full of people unable to communicate and game ruiners, worst community ive ever saw in a moba, try heroes of the storm, and dont even waste a single dollar for skins here, doesnt worth. have fun",3
"has slowly, but surely, driven me into downwards spiral of raging alcoholism. theres no turning back now. 10/10 would be super salty rustled tustled again",3

"well, i think its a good game. i reccomend to all gamers to try it! and of course enjoy it too!",1
"this game improved so much since it was released on the beta. there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1. i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers. i know some people who play lol might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. its like comparing cod and battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",1

"unless you can play this game or have the history of playing this kind of game, like for example dota 1 on warcraft, or if you have any friend to help you master this game, and have the intention to master this game, and prepared to get bullied, it is better for you to stay away from this game. for the people who just want to have some fun after busy days and play this game, but dont know or have less information about how to play this game, and the ethics on playing this game, they better avoid this game. a lot of people ruin other players time without the feeling of having fun, because of some reasons: 1. teammates that cant play and make the team lose and 2. the people who likes to blame others and think they are the best.",1
"dota will most likely sap away your life! i have been playing it for well over a decade (from when dota was a wc3 map) and still enjoy the competitive forum above anything else to be played on pc. the learning curve can be quite rough, especially if you jump right into the deep end competing against well experienced players. having said that; if that is the worst thing i could find to say about it and then considering all the fantastic ideas that are being implemented to make this incredible game more beginner friendly im pretty much saying nothing bad at all. just that this game is well worth the time spent getting to know the basics and then honing ones skills. great game!!!",2

"in this game, you can easily find friend and enemy, it was like from the beginning of the game, you already can decide, is your team mate is your friend, or your actual enemy, but that said, i have find more friend, much more friend rather than enemy. and it is one of the greatest learning simulator, 9/10 would play everyday to learn. 100000% recommended for anyone who want to get smart!! :)",2
"im just doing this to get the steam achievement. games good, though.",3
"one of the best since dota 1 iwth gameplay that let you show your skills and abilities. also find more friends online. and/or play online with family, friends, relatives and others. dota 2 has a very good, competitive gameplay and can be so addictive. play dota 2 as i recommend the game for all ages :)",2

"its an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. it took me a long time to warm up to, but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. if you can spare the time - play it.",1
"dota is a teamwork game, and you must support each other. throw your ego, discard your stupidity, put up some courage and concentrate. you must read a situation when playing this game, so dont be an airhead. every minutes is counted, so you must thing smart to overcame all situations. overall, this is fantastic game ever i played in my life",1
"as the moba genre began to rise to the spotlight of the gaming community. i decided to give it a try. i first tried league of legends, but was yelled at for being a noob and rage quitted. i thought this kind of behavior was counter-productive, because a gaming commmunity should be supportive of noobs....because even the gaming legends start as noobs as some point in their career. so i got frustrated, and didnt touch mobas for a while. however, im in deep love in valve and everything they do, so when i heard about dota, i got interested. when i completed the tutorial, and finally joined a game, everyone was helpful and willing to assist a noob to a very complicated and intricate genre. i still suck, as i play off a kind of beginners intinct and not off of a knowledge of the game. however, dota, with its compelling art style, helpful community, and a touch of gaben, blew lol out of the water for me.",1

"good enough to write a 5-6 page college essay about.",1
"love this game been playing it for years, never gets old.",2
"simply put, this game is misogynitic. it does nothing but further harmful female stereotypes and it celebrates patriarchy and he mental, emotional and mostly physical abuse of women. >all of the female characters are supports >they make less money than the men, and are expected to support the male characters who achieve everything >the one female carry, a strong, independent brown transwoman is banned from tournaments, because her mere existence threatens weak white cishets this is why dota will never be taken seriously.",1

"incredibly addicting. the gameplay itself is fun and engaging. it is played with a team of 5 characters with unique sets of skills and abilities versus another group. it is definitely a team effort to win the game. a single match would take about 40 to 60 minutes. customization of some aspects of the game adds another spice to the in-game play. characters costume sets, items, screensvers and skins and other dlcs which can be bought or traded at the steam market would keep the avid player own the characters. over all the game is exciting and fun. i give it 10 out of 10.",1
"totes recommend this moba fans. amazing. spent so many hours.",1
"league of legends and dota 2 are the same thing. play both and choose this one because i play it.",4
"as someone who had never played the original dota for warcraft 3 and had only played league of legends prior to the release of dota 2, i can safely say its worth the switch. the game was a little daunting at first to get learn but valve offer plenty of ways to learn, such as their tutorial system or bot match, even better now they added the in-game user guide menu which makes everything so much easier. there is a huge selection of heroes to pick from, each unique and fun to play including roles i wouldnt normally touch such as support, i honestly dont mind it in this game because its fun. every aspect of this game seems to be done really well, and it doesnt seem like valve is stopping on the updates anytime soon. the only negative thing i can say about this game is the community, but theses days if you play online you can expect that in any game.",4

"ive tried out every moba, but i always come back to this one. it is hard at first but usually if you stay away from matchmaking and stick with co-op bots people will generally help you. once you start learning how to farm effectively and deny the game starts getting a lot more fun, but like most people say no matter what you do there will always be russians in a few of your games. sometimes they will be nice and friendly but usually i wind up muting them. wont change my love for this game though.",1

"its ing dota... do i really have to say more than that?",5
"this game improved so much since it was released on the beta. there are over 90 heroes to choose from currently and the gamplay is as intence and as rewarding as dota 1. i know alot of people will be hesitant to try it at first but there has been a new tutorial system implemented in dota 2 and i think it will help new comers. i know some people who play lol might bash in this game, but both games are compleatly different. its like comparing cod and battlefield, they are so different that connot be compared. (no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",4

(except skins) no real money to buy that good champ you want -good community -much more rewarding for a skilled player. its not that other mobas are *easy* but more towards the idea of them taking less focus. -better graphics and particles (imo, because some can reason that their bad) -voice chat, allowing skilled party members to quickly say what they need to say rather than typing -very balanced. everything is weak against something else. cons: -laggy, at times. -occasionaly youll find a toxic player. (very rude) -much harder to git gud at, due to high experience needed. - oh yeah, and some people stay on the wrong server, despite being spanish, brazillian, russian",1

"okay well about two years after my first review i thought it was a good time to revisit this. this is by far the bestfree game out there(i have spent too much money on tourney tickets and .) and any of you losers still playing league of legends really need to take a step back and think about your life. are you ever going to take off the training wheels and step up your game? probably not, because youve become too used to babys first dota and the thought of having access to all the heroes is too daunting and youd rather only have the small pool of free heroes to select from. because you dont like having fun. and you like spending money on things that should have been free from the start. if you dont want to buy cosmetics or tourney tickets then all this game will cost you is your sanity and your faith in the human race. 11/10 would sacrifice firstborn to continue to play",4
"excellent game, recomend playing one character solidly to get used to the game and then branching out",1

"after two years in beta and now that it is officially released, this game is leagues better than any other arts / moba out there (pun intended). there are now a number of tutorials for new players, as well as limited heroes and all random game modes. dota 2 is really free-to-play, the items in the store are cosmetic only, and every game starts on a level playing field. if you play any dota-likes but havent played this yet, you definitely should!",1
"awesome and immersive gameplay! well ported from dota ! hats off to valve",3
"ok, a lot of mlg pros and fanboys were butthurt at my original dota review, so heres my edit i guess. my main reason for hatred towards dota 2 is aside from it being just another ing moba game is this: valve picked creating this game, over many, many others. keep in mind gabe newell, and valve overall. picked this game, over stars of blood. they picked this game, over half life 3. they picked this game, over left 4 dead 3. and this is just kinda spitballing but they picked this game, over maybe ing portal and team fortress 3. thats my honest reason on why i hate dota 2. its just a generic moba game when valve had tons of other decisions. i expected more out of valve i expected more out of gabe newell. when you finally start working your fat  on said games instead of...this...ill respect you again, but even still, i will never forgive your ing decision.",1

"i like this game because its a nice and fun game especially with my team :)",4
"very good community, basically the only reason i play this.",3
"an incredible amount of heroes and items combine to form some of the most versatile gameplay ive ever seen. the game is completely free-to-play, with cosmetics, which youll receive randomly by simply playing, costing very little money. in fact, there are no pay-to-win features. the learning curve is pretty steep, so if you dont persevere through your first few hours, you might just write it off as boring or too hard.",3
"i bought the pa arcana set for the items drop . i only got 3 drops 2 from my set ,it has been like 6-8 game that contract was denied or completed and we won the game but no drop??? can u only get a limited amount of drops or what??",2
"good game, lots of heroes where u can play with, i recommend u this game.",2
"the moba equivalent of getting kicked in the , repeatedly, for hours on end, until little remains of what could resemble genitalia. however, the truly astonishing part, is that this wasnt torture, but done through your own volition; you wanted to made miserable. hell, you probably paid for it a little. every game brings such traumatic pain and anguish, this game should be considered a war crime. psychologists have analyzed why dota players put themselves through this kind of hell, and all tests have come up inconclusive. this game has caused the perpetual virginity of thousands of people. friendships have been ruined, careers lost, and marriages have ended, all because of this game. dear god, get rid off this awful blight on humanity. only the dead can know peace from this evil... 10/10 i recommend this game to all my friends!",1
"one time i sold an item worth $40 in order to afford the xcom expansion. biggest mistake ive ever made.",1
"dota 2 is an awesome game ruined by its lacking match making skills. i found a guy who had 0% knowledge of the game so i tell steam plz fix this and do not match people with same level but same skill meaning judge a persons skill. any by the way i have seen lvl4 people playing with lvl76 people i mean whats that about really.",4

"this game.... where do i even start. this game has consumed, no, devoured into its abyss more than a thousand hours of my life. thats like watching youre favorite tv show (without ads) for close to 3000 episodes. i would rather kill myself rather than watch 3000 episodes of tv. after all these countless hours exploring the gaping void of what seems to be, as some would call, fun, in dota 2, i have learned a few things: 1. if someone picks void, lycan or naga, leave immidiately. do not pass go, do not collect 200 gold. 2. do not attempt to understand russia, russian people, culture, or anything associated with the words , blyat, id inahui, etc. 3. this game will destroy your ing life still better than lol dan outa dan - john wins",2
"dota 2 adds a great deal of complexity to the moba genre. its balance tenet is: everything goes. there is no character that is underpowered; in fact, theyre all overpowered in their own way. the game places a great burden of knowledge over whoever tries it out. be sure to stick to co-op games for starters. the tutorial may prepare you slightly, but the game as a whole is a lot more complex than other mobas on the market. oh, and the saying it aint over till its over applies here. you cant be sure youre winning until the radiant/dire goes down. lots of rooms for comebacks in here, but the game is far more snowbally than other mobas.",1
"1,000 hours later and were all still terrible at this game.",2
"best game ive ever played, you get hooked and dont want to quit, a bit of advise dont give up even if you lose the game, it only gets better. as you can see hours of gameplay and still going strong :d just dont feel intimadated by others yes the first few games you might lose and think to yourself why am i playing when i always lose. but the table will turn and when you start winning or have epic battles and your heart is pounding wether you are gunna win or not, thats when you realise that you love his game, truely awesome game. warning!!! highly addictive. have food and drink to hand and make sure you dont forget about people around you ( which you probably will ) :d",4

"when it comes to learning a new language, it beats the rosetta stone!",1
"the game itself isnt bad. nice depth, decent character selections. the community is garbage. pure filth, the likes of which you wont find anywhere else that is not a moba(youll find it in other mobas, apparently the hellbound enjoy this type of product). the game keeps wanting me to try it. the playerbase keeps wanting me to abandon all hope in humanity. so.......if you really dont care about other people, this may be for you. if other players can ruin team based experiences for you, keep looking.",1

"been playing dota 1 since 2006 and believe me this game is a whole new level of gaming experience. ive tried a lot of moba games and still, dota 2 still gives me the same feeling as dota 1 and even more. the map is still the same but the gameplay will forever change according to what the players will do in-game. making this game one of the most player skill dependent games out there. highly recommended. my hours of play tells it all.",5
"really entertaining game with tons of characters. you might run into your average player who was spoiled when growing up and whines when no one listen to his commands. you also have to get pass the noob insert player name here rants. good bit of players will speak russian, spanish, and portuguese. you might have a chance to understand them but in the end only having your face yelled at for misunderstanding an order from the auto-captain; which is the spoiled kid who you hate.",1

"welcome friends and all to the greatest game of the millenium. by the year 2030, dota 2 will have infiltrated into mainstream media and become the game to decide all conflicts and terrorities. a frantic rush to recruit all the top players was undertaken by the nations. a great battle was sieged and only one victor emerged . with excellent teamwork, vocabuary, the philippines quickly became the sole ruler of the earth. i have returned from this apocalypse and now i regularly play and hone my dota 2 skills for the day when the philippines will rise against us. 10/10 would play again.",2
"this game taught me to hate myself. brilliant 9/5.",2
"good game, lot of people play this game. lot of fun, thanks valve..",4
"ive played strategies mostly. moba is a different type of game, where you have less to worry about but you have other people to worry for, and coordinate with them. in rts games you are in control of everything and your opponent is in in control of everything. but here, you have to worry about 4 teammates and 5 opponents. what i like about is is the wide range of heroes to choose and the various ways you can play them, which makes the possibilities limitless. unlike lol which i have played for a bit, the graphics are less cartoony and the game rewards skill (denying and not feeding) and punishes you for bad play (enemies snowballing, losing towers, feeding etc.) the only thing i dont like are games taking 40 minutes on average. an sc2 game would take 15-30 mins.",2
"absolutely outstanding strategy game, although it can get very annoying. it is really addictive. and i almost do better than the russians almost...",1
"the most addicting multiplayer game ever ... has a hard learning curve but after that its funnnnnnnnn .......most recommended",2
"i tried to play this, but i couldnt due to how much of an annoyance it was to learn to play. this type of gameplay isnt my style, but i can see others having fun with it! happy gaming!",1
"kinda sure that i dont have to introduce this game.... so, simply said, this game is brilliant! even a statisctics are proving it, dota 2 is most played game every day on steam... so if you like moba games, youre sick of lol, hots is too much simple and smite is too new and different, then just download it and youll see it by yourself.",1

"this game is toxic and a waste of time. in its current meta, good luck trying to have fun even when winning. ice frog please stop doing cocaine your family is concerned.",4
"great game hard to play.....if you have no idea from dota or any other moba games dont even bother to play you will be noob for 2 years at least you are going to feed enemys and everyone will hate you just dont play it....but if you are learning fast find someone who knows how to play and plz him to teach you you will be able to play without feeding in half a year and if you are that good in learning things you can go watch pro streams and games so you can be better generally and not just a feeding boy",5
"people who play this game will betray you in the end.",1
"the only thing i disliked is the different turn rates of heroes, slow turn rates gives dota2 a slow-paced gameplay. overall, i think the game is great.",4
"this game is similar to the super smash bros, but it diverges from that mold as it has a certain touch of sorrow and a solid connection with the concept of the human condition. these two factors truely make it a great game. plus these as put in some flying- donkeys 9/10",1
"a game i genuinely cant quit. ignoring the great gameplay and visuals aside, this is one of my favorite e-sports to follow.",1
"i like this game ! its more simple than the dota warcraft .",1

"yes, steam, yes i do recommend this very awesome game.",3
"absolute  game if you want to always lose with stupid asians that cant speak english. the enemy team always picks the most op heroes while your team all pick 5 mid carries. if you love to always lose and get angry at your  team mates, have no cooperation or teamwork while the enemy tears you a new one with theirs this is the game for you. once you have sold your soul to the devil, its his forever. 0/10 would kill myself everytime and yell and the dumb asians asap. a great game that you think you will have fun with until you meet the disgusting players. nice b8 m8 i r8 8/8",2
"when i first started dota2 i was a little overwhelmed, as my first arts/moba game it was pretty complicated. i soon started to pick up the mechanics like last hitting and denying. before i knew it, i was performing  and better. i stopped making silly  and  got vastly better at not  the enemy . for the  part, everyone ive met was very helpful and , there  the   however. as  - play dota2    ,  ,     .      !",2

"i rate this game as one of the best moba, even more than league of legends or smite itself, great quality and good gameplay.",1
"learn russian for us $0.00. would reccomend 10/10. besides multiculturalism dota2 offers the chance to prove your own patience. sit for countless days looking at your monitor as a team of 4 other infuriating allies drag you down into the slums of their incompetence. unlike smoking, dota2 cannot be cured or helped by a doctor and this plague on humanity will not and cannot be stopped. you will slowly deteriorate on your seat untill all that is remaining is a steaming pile of filth. the pain does not end with your passing unfortunatly; all your money that was meant to see your family make it without you is now in the form of your account, with no real-world usefulness at all. have fun with dota2",2
"won this game with 4 russians in my team... im pretty sure i can nail dark souls, though i never played it before.",5
"fantastic game. much longer more intense games, better skill cap and actually requires teamwork and mana control. oh and you dont get shitlords that scrap their way to 6 build because you actually lose gold if you are bad. secondly, there arent runes so everyone is equal at the start and you dont get shafted by picking the wrong runes or not owning some, hereos are all free, items are cheaper and you can mix and match items from different sers as they go into slots and are cheaper. finally you dont get summoner spells so people if they get caught, die. they dont flash away and you cant just run up and hit a tower without creeps due to backdoor protection, so rat dota takes skills.",1
"probably the best game ever made. always come back to it, and always find a reason to yell at  and russians. thanks obama.",3
"i dont get this game, its like civilization, every one picks one of the 108 country but its a 5v5 game. the diplomatic exchanges with your team mates are limited because you can trade a limited amount of luxuries and you have to spend a big amount of gold to upgrade your country, there is no research feature, also the spying are realy limited as you can only place wards (wich replace spys in this game) on the map but they are usless. they are city states but they just stand here and hit whats in range and never come to help you when you are far from them. finaly there a only 3 era (early, mid and late) but it dont change much the gameplay and some country are too op in the late era and you cant buy atomic bomb to nuke them 2/10, this game lacks a lot of content to pretend to be a civlization-like",1
"great game, free to play, have a good time with ya mates and meet all kinds of people lol what more could ya ask for.",2
"this game is play much by myself, but i feel it lacks in abillites and champion roles in the sense that it really doesnt have much varity in how you build your champ/hero as a build can work in just about every situtation. this my seem like a major nark on the game, but id say its rather good besides that one part. it has good graphics and a fairly good champ/hero pool. i would say try this out if youre content on not play lol and games like this, but if youre open to the moba lifestyle try lol first honestly. 3.5 out of 5 stars for gameplay. 4.5 out of 5 stars for pc controls",1
"first of all, there appears to be no need to ever buy this game. someone with 10 copies of this will gift one to one of your friends, who will find his copy multiplied by 10, who can then give one to you. now, should you actually play it? sure - its got unusuals and crates and all that jazz, so its basically team fortress 2 for boring people. be prepared for a steep learning curve, lots of abuse and a vocabulary full of words that will make your friends cringe. you got ganked son. enjoy your 10 copies of this game.",1
"this game teaches you fundamental life skills such as laziness, fear of going outside, anger, and last but not least, racism. /10 would recommend",1

"ahhh.... dota 2. this game is severaly unbalanced since no matter how well you play, your team will always blame you for the loss. it is also insanely luck based because the team that gets most russians usually looses. a lot of functions in this game are completely broken as well. for example, even if you pick english in the language bar everyone still speaks russian. sometimes german or french, but never english. playing this game i had a few mental breakdowns and smashed three windows in total. it sometimes feels like my life is fading away and i imagine life in prison with a really musculine in-mate would provide the same level of . to sum up, this is game is ing terrible. 10/10 would recommend.",4

"10/10 recommended, its a game where you meet infamous thai girl(?) noozkii, a female womanizer, and a male catfisher with names like miyako. oh, you will also encounter people who sound like a great leader and stream their game in twitch. lastly, what you will always see in this game is harvest moon legend, who farms potatoes for the entire game.",3
"the most addictive game ive ever played in my life. the infinite possibilities of every single game, depending on very minute decisions juxtaposes it so much to our real lives. although the learning curve is too steep, once you give about a week for it, the mechanisms in the game are clear to you. definitely recommended.",4
"this game was there for me when i needed to waste time and vent out. definitely worth wasting your life on.",1
"play with people from all over the world, whether you want to or not.  get cool items so you can be spammed friend requests from scammers in 3rd world countries.  be reminded of how much you hate humanity in general with the constant aneurisms caused by their gameplay decisions.  this game has it all.",3

"after 10 years this game is still fun...most of the time. also with the built in language learning software, and patience adjuster...you will be a grown human after taking this titan of a title on! viva dota! deuce!",2
"excellent game. after playing the first (and best) dota, lol, hon and a few other mobas, i found this one to be the best. not only is it the incredible graphics, intense gameplay or the classic feel of old dota, but the online gameplay is incredible. the only problem i had with this game was the amount of updates and the fact that other countries choose to play where they will not be best, such as russians playing in the south african server, not that i am complaining, that is just my opinion. pros: - excellent gameplay - great graphics - classic feel - simple use - kept old dotas characters, gameplay and items cons: - not a great matchmaking system - 5-10minutes inbetween matches - too many updates - updates are too large all round: a great game which i have been addicted to for the past month.",1
"all my friends are playing this game, its fast and it requires teamwork!",3
"i appreciate this game for its insightful political commentary.",1
"iv been through so much with this damn game. ive had to get three new pairs of astro a40s from my 2 year experience in this game. it takes a lot of practice to get good at it. but once you do its very rewarding. if youre the kind of person that doesnt want to spend over 400$ on new headsets. this game is totally not for you. rage on.",2

"this game is like a ier version of league of legends. obviously copied all the champions from league of legends and just called them a different name and put them in dota. cant believe no one has realised what a blatant copy dota is of league of legends. 0/10",1
"dota 2 is brought to us at a time when the dominating moba (league of legends) thrives and beats it in numbers of users etc. but dota 2 brings variety to the table as it is a very pretty game with different mechanics and gameplay, if you do play league of legends this is probably the next best thing and shouldnt be left in the shadow, when released the game will be played maybe not as much a league of legends but there is definatley a strong community which willl show on release. i am happy to be part of the beta as it refreshing to play but a can be hard to master!",1
"this game is awesome and i really like strategy games",3
"very fun to play, alot of customization for the hero you like or just for costume fun and the game is always evolving",2
"i am new when it comes to this style of game but after the steep learning curve i am starting to get it. my son loves the game so thats why i tried it. i like the concept and the community seems to be a pretty positive one. quite a change from some of the fps games i play where you are lucky to not get insulted by children let alone adults.",1
"this game is very well made and i love all the new characters, if valve would like some character ideas i would lik ethem to contact me. i am very creative and would like to help produce items in this game.",1

"if you want to feel heavily violated by russians this is the perfect game for you! 10/10!",1
"started out playing dota on the old wc3 engine and i played that for 7+ years before i shifted into dota 2 with the beta. dota 2 offers much more than the original wc3 version in terms of graphics and gameplay, as the old engines hero and skill interactions were hampered by limitations (dota allstars was just a custom map). cosmetics, tournaments, and streaming are all seamlessly integrated; and are constantly being improved at the behest of the community. the game is a bit hard to get into at first, but after you have the basics down, youll play for an innumerable amount of time. adding friends into the mix for crazy strategies and plays increases the replayability and enjoyment of the game to another level. one of the best games. ever.",3

"has caused me to have extreme trust issues and an overall hatred for those around me, 10/10",4
"amazing, upgraded version of the original warcraft 3 dota. probably one of the hardest mobas out there, but becouse of that, it is challenging and fun. if you like the genre and love to be tested in both your patience and skill, this is the game for you!",2
"nice game and community,, hope better in the next year,, :d",2
"why sea asia sever keep got problem i keep cant ply with my friends",4
"approaching 2100 hours played...wow. while i do completely agree with the reviews that talk about how bad the community is, i have to say my experience of dota on the whole has been very enjoyable. the mute option is great, i insta-mute anyone talking crap. admittedly dota has an incredibly high learning curve, and you will often find high level players playing on noob accounts so even the early matches for new players can be brutal. if you can push through the first couple of hundred hours of games ;) and ignore the torrent of expletives thrown your way when you let the team down!; you will find dota 2 to be a: competitive, intense, challenging, and completely engaging experience.",4
"best multiplayer game i ever played, very skill rewarding. very steep learning curve, but once you get past it, its the most rewarding game ever.",3
"had to go to rehab for this game 10/10 and i may not complete this review if the stupid assistants at this rehab catch measdaisjfafs",2

"can be a bit difficult to get to learn, but if you put the time into learnnig then it is brilliant. espacially when you have a team of friends to play with as tactics play a huge part in winning.",1
"its halfway there to ruining my life and i aint stopping now.",1
"hours of fun, all you have to do is select in which russia you want to play today!",3
"really cluncky, and has some serious balance issues. the only advantage of this game over other mobas is the community, however the community can only do so much. the mechanics and the whole low prio system dont do anything for it. i really with they would improve the movement in the game, perhaps by implementing a system like another moba league of legends. over all i would say its worth a play, considering that it is on steam and the chances are you mates will be playing it, but i do believe its possition on steam, and the whole nostalgia thing gives this game more popularity than it deserves. 4.5/10 worth a play, but not the greatest game. 6.5/10 if your playing with firends.",1
"what to say in dota... die? jajajajajajaja kill? jajajajajajaja get insulted? jajajajajajaja every minute? jajajajajajaja this is dota 2. also throw in a few s and vodkas. always pick riki. always get dagon. always afk. epic game, play at least 500 hours of it. then dont stop. keep playing. keep learning. keep feeding. jajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajajaja!!!!!",3

"i was a jamaican guy and when i healed people i swear he used a lil bit of ganja! great!",1
"awesome game, but has a very huge learning curve. which means you have to play a lot of games just to learn the ropes. if you are looking for campaigns or binge campaign mode gaming, this game is not for you. if you are looking for fps games that end in 10 mins, this game is also not for you. if you are looking for 30 mins - 1 hour real time strategy game, this game is for you.",3
"very good game, sometimes hate when selected the european west and get 4 russians :d (  and fuc*** ur mum) .",3
"a pulchritudinous looking game, it is definitely my personal favorite moba game yet. it has a huge hero roster, is completely free (the only possible transactions result in aesthetic changes), requires coordinated teamwork and has a huge fan base and community. that said, you should be wary of many of the players, as many are extremely negative and will work to frustrate and annoy you in whatever way possible. in many cases you will feel that an opponent is overpowered, or a particular hero is cheap, but i can assure that in 95% of these cases, that is not true. i would also highly recommend that you learn the basics first and complete the tutorial, because your first few games are gonna be rough; you will probably get crushed into the finest paste youve ever been in your life.",3
"played few hours, good game. 10/10 would play again.",4
"just amazing game,i have been playing this game like 4 n half years now...1st dota 1 then this,never gets boring..... kinda addictive game....but u will have real fun playing this game.idk bout lol but this is just amazing n most skillfull game. doesnt matter if u r new in dota family,game provides all basic lessons in-game. but u still need 2 control your hunger after playing this game..kinda destroys your important hours of your life as well if u got no self control.",2
"amazing game you just need a good team and go a head and f**k the team haha play for fun not for wins",3
"literally best moba 10/10 anno domini 2k are you even trying riot?",2
"game of the year 2013 for me. got a closed beta key of a friend of mine, and started playing some bots with another friend. we sucked, at first. than we started to become better and have more fun playing. the last couple of months weve been playing almost on a daily basis. dota 2 is a moba, a very popular gametype nowadays. but game has some interesting mechanics other mobas dont have. those minor differences dont seem to make a huge gamechanger, but believe me: they do. i would highly recommend this.",1
"i hate this game like seriously i hate all of this like i have learned to hate things i cannot understand, peoples i have never met, and emotions ive never know to feel before i playd this game. its like learning just to fail. it tests the limits of humanity in a philosphical way that degrades the mind, and stamps on the soul. why did i ever play this? why did i particpate and ignore the warnings of others and sink all this time into this madness? this game is like your crush continuosly telling you she doesnt like you and slowly pushing you out of his or her life. this review says i have around 400 hours of gameplay. but you dont understand, every one hour of stress is about 5 more hours and self hate, loathing, and mass sprits of depression man this stinks",1

"this is a fun game but very hard and i am terrible. 7/10",1
"well for starters, take a look at my total hours played. that should tell you how much i like this game. i honestly find the idea of a moba very appealing. although there might be other games out there in the genre that (dare i say it) are better than dota 2, i still find dota 2 to be the one game i always go back too. the game mechanics are solid, the character balancing is always changing, adding new depths to the gameplay, and many of the players in dota are relatively laid back. is dota 2 the best game in the world? probably not. is dota 2 the game i have spent 1000+ hours on and will probably spend another thousand on? absolutely.",4

"this game has a wicked learning curve, but it is well worth your time to learn. although it is similar to league of legends, dota 2s variables have a lot more impact on the game, and i feel this greatly enhances the gameplay to a point beyond where other moba games have reached. 10/10 would bang.",1
"this. this game is the king of free to plays. it is the king of mobas and it will ruin your life with its addiction. the depth of this game is amazing, a huge variety of items and characters to do battle 5 vs 5 in online multiplayer. i would like to point out that this game has only one map. one ing map that never gets boring. the best way i can describe dota 2 is that its like chess and football, its a game of momentum as well as timing and skill. everyone needs dota 2 in their life. put it like this, i have 80+ games that i may as well uninstall because i only play this game. 10/10.",1

"im still dipping my toe in this game. after 45 hours of playing, i still feel like a noob. this game requires a lot of commitment, and the learning slope is deep! but once you get the basics, its completely worth it. the game is like chess with a team. the hero you choose has a few skills, and determines what you bring to the table. then, for the next 15-35 minutes, and you and your team working together to beat up the other team. play the tutorial. personally, i played it just to learn how to watch the live-steams!",1

"never has a game enfuriated me so much, yet have me coming back so often. this game is rage induced crack straight to my brain via right mouse click. it has made me hate any language that isnt english, and has reduced my people skills to racial slurs and swears. matches run from 30-75 minutes, and are filled with dissapointment, anger, and russians. all heroes need nerfs followed by a proportional buff. rat doto isnt strategy; its a way of life. rage as towers fall, and teammates feed, and all you can do is stand there helpless with your iron branch, a tango, and that ward the support planted in your own fountain, for some reason. your ancient falls, and you throw your dog out the window, punch yourself in the balls, then sit down and queue for another match. would do it all again.",3

"with over 110 heroes to choose from, dota 2 has one of the steepest learning curves of all the games available on steam. many players find that even after 100+ hours of gameplay, they feel incompetent at the game. while this is probably dota 2s greatest downfall, it is also the aspect that makes the game as great as it is. there is just so much to learn in this game, that it will provide fans with countless hours of playtime. verdict: dota 2 is an extremely difficult game, and that is what makes it most rewarding. yes, the amount of time it will take a new player to become even an average player may take well over 100 hours. however, if you are can overcome its steep learning curve and are looking for a game long term, dota 2 may just be the best game you can currently find - and it is free.",3

"an excellent moba, and theres little wonder that its the most popular game on steam at the moment. the fact that the 100+ heroes are unlocked off the start means that theres plenty of gameplay variety even if the actual modes are a bit lacking, and the amount of depth is pretty staggering. saying that, the community is absolutely wretched, and undoubtably the worst part of the game. this is the type of game where the more sensitive among us will want to turn off voice and text chat in order to enjoy some hassle-free fun. the free-to-play model is perhaps the best in the industry, even better than tf2s, and you can play the entire game without spending a cent and not feel restricted in any way compared to a paying player. truly a mastercraft in just about every regard.",1

"as such, you should not expect to have fun your first day playing... or even your first week. that sounds like a cardinal sin of gaming, but theres method to this madness. in short, dota 2 is a deeply layered construct of systems, and to survive you need to understand every single one and how they interact with one another. everything from learning to work as a member of a coordinated team to the counter-intuitive practice of killing your own ai units to deny the enemy experience points and gold theyd get from doing it themselves, and understanding the effects of hundreds of complex abilities like bloodseekers rupture (which deals",2

"first review.. so dota2, where to begin. firstly, it is a fantastic game, which community is growing rapidly. with the up coming ti4, there really isnt a greater time to join the game. the range of heros is a good amount, not too many that it would be impossible for someone from the team of 5 for there to be an unused hero. the one thing that lets the game down is new players. now im not saying new players are all bad and should stop playing the game. i think we (experienced players) need to help them, maybe have an academy option of some sort meaning new players are able to be coached by experienced players before they enter match making. this is what i did when i began playing the game a few years ago and something i have done in turn teaching new players. that would be my only advice to new players learn from experienced team mates. if your friendly and dont ignore what they tell you they wont get angry.",2
"run in to many asshats, but the good games make it worth the pain. incredible when a game goes right.",4
"been 10 years! i feel like the play style and the heroes are the really enjoyable. dota is never ending fixing balancing etc. however this is not a downside. as it is a growing game. dota 2 is the best at his class. if you are a new player here is what you should know though; - make sure you ignore flamers - try to watch couple twitch streams in order to understand how pros do it - be polite in games, if someone is rude to you just ignore him - if you dont want to ignore make sure you do not respond them. because talkin back to them in order to explain your thoughts will just make them insult you more. they will not understand %100 guarenteed. if you mute everyone at start of the game you should have a wonderful experience! =)",5

"1,587 hours on record for a reason. this game is more competitive and less childish than my previous game and train wreck of a dota-like accectable choice league of legends. yes the dota 2 community is rough but that is how it has been since dota on wc3. harder than usual to walk into and get going at first because of the vast knowledge of the game but replays can easily fix that in a day. overall great game and once again,  league of legends.",4

"continuing in the footsteps of dota. this game will beat (if not already) all other moba games for sure.and the idea of keeping it completly free while getting a lot of profit with cosmetic items is brilliant. constant updates and balance changes keep the higher ranked players from getting borred. keep up the good work.",3

"i dont think there is anything to say about this, number of positive reviews says it all.",2
"challenging game with numerous interesting aspects. free to play and very enjoyable!",4
"when i started playing dota 2, i didnt know any russian, now im vladimir putin. a better language learning software than rosetta stone. 69/10, would recommend.",2
"dota 2 is a competitive game.. its a hard game but once you get used to it, you cant leave your pc!",1
"youll never be able to play enough dota 2 to totally master it, and although its an f2p game it can be too cruel and unusual for some. but persist through the tough start and accept the idiosyncrasies, and youll start to understand why so many have stuck with it for more than a decade. why would they need something new when theyve got this incredibly deep, rewarding multiplayer experience? rating: 9.9",4
"cout << would definitely recommend.. best multiplayer strategy game out there with superb gameplay.. & whats more, its free!!  << endl;",2

"i was a little unsure about how to get into a game like dota 2. there is so much to know about it. however it does a great job at introducing you to new concepts and easing you into online games. i really enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone.",1
"a real competitive game, valve did a very nice job bringing dota 2. a real strategy game, a challeging fun game. there is over 112 heroes to try, each one is balanced, and no hero is the most powerfull or the most weak, every hero in the game is equal, every hero have his / hers high and lows. and that my friend is dota 2.",3
"i really cant say anything other then this game is ing amazing. look at all the hours ive spent in the game. you all are probably like well, there are these people who have spent thousands of hours in the game, so thats not many. but do take into account that my total time owning this game hasnt even exceeded a year yet. there is not a day i remember since i got this game that i havent at least opened dota 2. usually to play a public game, sometimes to play a bot game, and sometimes to brush up on hero knowledge and look at guides. this game will ruin your life and obliterate all your free time. my only warning to new players is that the community it pretty toxic to new players, and not everyone speaks english. just mute anyone calling you a noob, flaming you, etc. but never do so to the people that legitimately want to help you. overall rating: 11.6/10.",2
"the only game i played everyday. the only game i will play for another years in the future. the only game that will never uninstalled off my laptop. the only game that will still played even after i turn 50. the only game that played by 10 out of 15 pc on internet cafe. the only game that wherever we go, people will always have knowledge about it. the only game that often makes me mad, happy, envy, angry, grows at the same time. the only game that worth 10,000 hours for me to spent to. i am loving it. dota 2, the game that lives.",3
"now i cant play any other game because they are not dota!",4

"great game. i have been playing dota 1 in the old days and although the game is great, i found myself constantly complaining about the lag, network issues and lack of a community. however, dota 2 has solved all that and to my suprise, even improved on what i would have though would be the perfect game. however, becareful. once you join dota 2, there is no turning back. be prepared to lose a bulk of your life.",4
"1. youll learn to play as a team 2. youll learn how to not give up till the throne is down! 3. encounter people with different language in 1 game 4. sacrifice for others 5. get used to be blamed by others 6. discover that not all of dota 2 players are kind, so deal with it :)",3
"its just amazing, thats really all there is to say. and if you really want proof, just look at all the players, globally. and dont even get me started on the level of competition in this gem of a ing free to play game, does a grand prize pool of a little over 2 million* mean anything to anyone? thanks a lot valve for making me feel guilty, i aint worthy to play this. oh and thanks blizzard! youll always be top tier. *and now with the international 4 the prize pool is over 9 million. go ing figure.",5

"this game is more addictive than crack cocaine, you will loose you girlfriend and end up in the streets after when the game is done with you. 10/10 would play again.",1
"yes this game is hard to learn. yes people can be rather aggressive. yes it is possibly the best multiplayer experience ive ever had and yes once you play at least 10 games youll be hooked. i try to play at least one game a day and have been doing so for months and dont plan on stopping. give the game a chance (more like 5) and i guarantee that youll see why its the most played game on steam. be prepared to be dumbfounded as to why you were playing anything else. also a side note: the games free. steam is free. the only thing u have to lose from giving it a try is alil self respect in the beginning. but dont worry after one game where u actually do really good youll feel like a million bucks.",2
"this game makes you see that there are a vast variety of individuals and that you hate them all.",3

"its like league of legends, but you snowball harder. never heard of league? then its like heroes of newerth, but with mroe foreigners. never heard of hon? its like dota 1, but with a 2 and better graphics. never heard of dota 1? its like smite, but top down instead of first person. never heard of smite? its like monday night combat, but top down, fun, and with developers who do . never heard of monday night combat? its like cod ghosts, but a different genre. oh and its free. that too.",1
"i played this game once or twice. it is ok i guess.",2
"if you are willing to waste hundres or even thousands of hours of your life playing the same map and the same heroes over and over and over again only to be flamed by your team in russian then this is the game for you!",4

"i dont care what other people say, dota 2 is a wonderful game. sure you meet the common tryhard every now and then but the problem with the russians isnt near as bad as people make it out to be. ive only played with russians maybe twice out of my 400 hours (estimate) of playing. i love the community and best of all, its free. so go try it, youll love it i swear.",1

"the best alternative to rosetta stone for learning russian, czech and other western bloc european languages. intimidating in the beginning but you will quickly be calling everyone noobs and asking for everyone to report them for some random reason or another. be prepared to beg for commendments to make you feel better at night, otherwise your flawless 1-27 run as dark seer will make you wish your parents never shacked up during that greatful dead concert.",2

"want a friendly community who accepts mistakes? want a team that speaks your language? go play an inferior game. want a game that is as rewarding as it is frustrating that is more in-depth and strategic than anything in the genre. this is your game. 10/10 would recommend to the serious gamers, not those who want a chill/laid back game. also you can kill donkeys.",1
"quite nice game, i am collecting a team, english players only",1
"awesome game for me..since dota 1 on warcraft iii.",2
"awesome game that requires strategy planning and huge amount time.",1
"a dynamic system to entertain the mind, train your brain/memory, enjoy great pvp and develop leadership, teamwork, foresight, calculation and prediction skills. a varied cast of characters each with their own skill set and a wide range of items to help with customization of the way you want to play. an interesting community ranging from great, co-operative players and impressive enemies, to the lowest gamer quality which require you to develop patience and restraint. if you consider picking this game up, remember, there is a high learning curve, therefore you must be prepared to fall and rise again in the never-ending battle between the dire and the radiant. good luck, have fun",2

"it will slowly eat you from inside until you feel nothing but a cold stone in place of your heart. 11/10.",3
"great game, it might be hard to get in to for non moba players but the game depth is great and it will bring hours of enjoment especially if you play with friends.",1
"its a nice game, its free to play and it gives you the ability to spend all your free hours for the next 6 months at least. if you ever played this type of game that is. it has good graphics and nice mechanics. a few drawbacks are : 1. its sort of hard to learn. 2. some heroes are a bit unbalanced and for you people in western europe 3. eu west server is like russia 2 >_< i do like the game overall though and i can keep on playing it for a while",3

"andrew says it 9/10. but not as good as fallout new vegas. risk factions still number 1",2
"a fantastic multiplayer experience. this game is deeply complex with its metagame and many strategies a team can employ. the community is not as toxic as many say it is. yes there are the few rude, obnoxious, and annoying players but that is true for all multiplayer games. there are many ways to play such as the carry, support, nuker, initiator, and jungler. these roles all have their place in this game and there is something for everyone. pros: - complex but easy to get into - many ways to play - relies on teamwork - great esport community - 100% free - nice aesthetic - many heroes to choose from - great ui - very rare glitches - dota tv - metagame cons - a little difficult to get into - players not playing on thier regions server - first few hours are not very fun - occasionally takes a while to join a game",1
"played dota 2 for a week. now im fluent in russia and tagalog. 10/10 best foreign language teacher out there.",1
"an accurate representation of pubbing in this game would be to imagine yourself trapped in a sewer swimming around eating nothing but turds your entire life, each turd represents an average public game. now imagine after all of those turds you go to eat the another one and to your surpise it is a chocolate bar, it is the best feeling in the world. that chocolate bar represents those occasional games where everyone is evenly skilled and tastes so good that you continue eating turds just hoping for that next chocolate bar.",3
"i like the game so much! i am addicted to the game! but i dont like the idea when someone is noob to play, reported by other player for playing noob! maybe he is a beginner, why blame it to him when the team is lossing.",3

"theres too much to say about dota2. all i can say is i love playing the game.",1

"i cant say anything for this game, but this is best game ever !",2
"awesome visual!!! great audio (soundfx, music, voice of character) love it!! dota2 is a high risk game, in addition to depend on our efforts in carrying out the decision, the mood was also very influential until the end of the game. if got the victory we will get an incredible mood, whereas if you lose, we will move to the bed as soon as possible lol xd i think this is not just a game, its a lifestyle, art and culture, of course to sharpening intelligence in making decisions. deur! (lets go!)",5

"mediocre game, but it gives the kids at the special olympics something to do",1
"the classic wc3 map from icefrog totally revamped and upgraded to fit in the e-sports scene.one of the best games i ever played and continue to play without getting even a little bored.it is getting better and better by the time as updates keep coming.this year every team member of the team that wins the main event of dota 2 will be a millionaire.thats astounding for 4 years of existence in the moba genre which changed after the arrival of this game.",1
"dota is the true way to meet ppl from other countrys and it will make u become an over-night raceist in no time soon. peru,brazzil, and ruskies team-mates on ranked have made me more patriotic than 9/11 did. usa usa usa",3

"definitely a good old game made brand new with style. try it!",1
"this game is horrible, but at the same time good, it takes a tonne of time to get the hang of the game, and its normally only fun when you win (differs from persons) i love it, but at the same time hate it, you really need a party of friends, or good players to win, in this game you loose if you have one bad player on youre team, and if you dont have the right balance of supports and carries/ semis then you loose :l some heros are overpowered and yet some underpowered. and for some reason people in low priority are better than in a normal match one of the first mobas ever made, when it was made is was very popular on warcraft3 and of course its free, most rage enducing game since call of duty you need to play it to understand so enjoy!",2
"only game where you can get yelled at in russian, shoot a demon with a laser beam, and win a hat all at the same time. 11/10 would recommend.",3

"awesome game, with great support from valve. it is a real free to play game that has the production value of a full priced title, the gameplay is very deep and with it comes a somewhat steep learning curve but the matchmaking makes it quite ok (you play against people about your own skill level) esports side is very well integrated and a blast to watch whether or not you play the game!",3
"who needs to go russia when you can experience it from the comfort of your own computer seat. 10/10",1

"this game is really nice. if you wanna win this game, its not just your skill but its about team.",1
"for me it is like a daily routine to play and compete against players across the world. not just we share our views but also our intellects collide on the same battlefield to determine the wave of glory for teams playing each round. sometimes we win but we loose which really makes to see deep in our hearts where we need the fear to be controlled and our reflexes on time through the game any time any place. at last it made us a way better than we happen to be in our previous game. understanding and reasoning the events of game is the most key factor if u really need to make best out of your effort. this game really changed us more than just one way.",5
"play with russians/pinoys who dont speak your native language and abuse voice chat. rage and lose the game. queue again. repeat. 10/10 would recommend and play again.",2
"ruined my life. cant find the jump button. 10/10 would buy again.",4

"though i havent played much of this game, i would recommend it to anyone who like moba titles. this game seems very confusing at first but gets easier with experience, not to say people whove played the game since release arent the best players, its all strategy based, anything could happen in the middle of the game you seem to be winning suddenly turns into you getting your  kicked. enjoy! p.s. this game does come at a cost, your social life.",1

"do you like mobas? enjoy league of legends or smite? well this game is, of coruse, another moba. however it is also the original moba. one of the things you may love or hate about dota is that there isnt really any sort on unfairness to new players beyond skill. if a person with 10,000 hours faces a player who has only 12 they have no different items, no different heroes, no different abilities. the veteran may have new aesthetic things but the only thing seperating them will be skill. if youre new to mobas i encourage you to try this one, they are very fun and are fortunately not pay to win.",2

(even if someone hates it.) the graphics are good, the game mechanics are fun and varied, the enviroment and map seems to be quite detailed too, i may not play it too much, but that doesnt means i think that indeed this game is one of the best; if not the best game out there of the moba genre.",1

"dota 2 is a highly strategic-teamwork-heavy game where the objective is to infilitrate the enemy base and destroy their ancient, but there are towers defending the base aswell as enemies. you must level up, gain gold and purchase items to upgrade your character to compete with the 5 players on the other team. there is a very very vaste variety of heroes to choose from, it is recommended that you play them all, to know their weaknesses, strengths and just for fun! its a little confusing at first, but its a blast once you get some friends to play with, a mic, and some practice. i highly recommend downloading this free game if you are looking for a strategic game that requires teamwork. if you have alot of free time, this game is great, because a single game can take 25 min to 1.5 hours!",2

"dota 2 is many things to many people: its a great way to kill an afternoon with friends; its a spectator sport platform with its own item-betting scene; its a hobby; its a profession, and a way to make a living. it isnt perfect and likely never will be, as each update tends to fix bugs and introduce new ones, and the tutorial could certainly use some work. however, with zero cost to play and one of the highest skill ceilings of any game ive ever encountered, dota 2 is a modern multiplayer masterpiece.",1

"dota is like chess except there is only 5 peices and you are one of them. it takes a very long time to really get good at the game, and you will probably get mad, and have people get mad at you because this game is multiplayer and that is what happens in multiplayer games.",4
"i like this game because of the graphics. it so fun i love playing dota because when im playing dota im so happy =)",1

"im not a huge fan of mobas, but i do enjoy league of legends very much and ive played smite when it first came out. like most mobas, the community can be cruel and insane at times, torching you for the simplest mistakes. neat and interesting abilities that can be even complicated the first time you use them, this game has a lot of replay, giving you the choice to play many many heroes. unless you like competition and a fierce community, stay away from dota and try lol or another moba, but you should still give it a try, play a bot game or two and feel the game. no pay 2 win as its a official steam game, and a very successful one. you can earn and buy costumes and cosmetics through playing the game and buying them with real money. if you feel up to it, you can also trade unwanted cosmetics for ones you want through the steam trading system. personal rating: 3.5/5",1

"a must play for anyone. from a large pool of unique heroes you play as one who possesses unique abilities to be used in tandem with the rest of your team in order to out-maneuver the opposing team. my first moba was lol, and i have permanently made the switch to dota 2 after weighing the pros and cons, and have never looked back. with the talented people at valve continuing to produce and develop this game, i am absolutely certain this will be a revered classic for many years to come.",1

"at the moment, i have a whooping 1000+ hours spent on dota 2. dota 2 itself is the stand alone placement after dota, a wc3 custom map, which has been getting reworked with a new graphic and engine, that can support future updates to the game. in total, dota 2 is very addicting, with its system of free to play, with no buff for premium player, because the only thing you can buy in game is just cosmectics, so users with cash will not own you like in the other f2p model game. so, dota 2 is really worth it, and hopefully it will be upgraded into betterment in the future, as well as become the best e-sports in the world.",4

"this game will beat the living crap out of you when you start. but if you give it time, it becomes one great game for you to play over and over again. all the heroes are free to play to begin with so youll find a character that fits your playstyle. there are plenty of tactics and items for you so you will not get the same experience. there are also the cosmetics that cn make your characters unique. you can buy them, or you can play matches and earn them by completing them. it is a game that will be addictive but it is good none the less.",3

"honestly there is a massive learning curve for the new players, but valve is constantly adding features to make the game and its concepts as accessible to the public as possible. the fact that it is free leaves it all up to the player to decide whether the game is for them; nothing is stopping you from trying it out. but for those who are already into this genre of gaming, im not going to sugarcoat our community, there are positives and negatives to every aspect of social interaction in this game. you prefer what you prefer, but the game is stellar for me.",3

"in my opinion dota 2 is the best moba, being the offical succesor to dota and having a deep meta-game+mechanics that changes now and then. valve game too so the quality is pretty much assured and the free to play model is just superb. all heroes unlocked no paywall, you dont have to pay for anything expect cosmetics and tournaments. some tournaments are free to watch(mlg and international). it has some flaws including the community but that is an issue that cannot be fixed and i would recommend to everyone who wants to play a moba/is currently playing a moba. almost perfect but with room for some improvements.",4

"dota 2 at first doesnt seem like one of the best games but once you get into it and get some hours on the clock playing, youll notice how you can endlessly enjoy the game. the bonus to that is that there are no cheaters and people that might ruin the game for you. the game mechanics are designed well although some heroes/champions are over powerered if you master them over other ones. the in-game purchases have nothing to do with player performance, you can buy skins or rather clothes for them making you stand out but dont improve your skills or anything. overall i rate the game 8/10. -1 for some heroes over powered. -1 for the dota 2 network being a problem.",2

(basically, you can get any item you want through random drops, or from trading with other players.) it is a very complicated game however, much harder than its counterpart league of legends. pros -many heroes -all heroes are unlocked at the start -very precise balancing -a lot of different strategies and ideas -very large community (most popular game on steam) -very little issues, even on my barely-gaming rig cons -complicated, and it takes a while to learn all the mechanics -tutorial can be a little vague or dense -one player can ruin a whole game (inherent of all games in this genre) -extremely hostile or crude community -lacks any form on region lock, and the report system is barely functional this game functions very well, and truly deserves its crown of the most popular game on steam. long live dota! 4.5/5 9/10",2

"this game is interesting because while it is very enjoyable and there is lots of variety; the people you will play with rarely know how to work as a team and when they do its becasue the enemy is really bad at the game. also the community is very unwelcoming to noobs so if you just joined and are learning how to play nobody likes you. all in all it is one of my favorites but i will warn you it isnt the easist to just pick up and play. also there is a low prioority pool so if you cant get out of that you will always be with noobs even if you are a good player.",2

"this is a game that surprised me. most of the game is just clicking with the mouse, right click to do this, left click to do that. it did require a bit of effort getting used to it. but it can be picked up easily. still getting to grips with the camera. and the lengthy matches means that you play for hours without realising it. this game probably will take up a lot of time in your life, so make sure you have many reasons to leave your computer screen.",1

"not just a game for fun. but this game need teamwork, inovation, great instict and creativity",4
"this is a very fun strategy game. the 5v5 makes it so that everyone on you team is important, unlike other games where there are probably thousands of other players just like you, dota makes it one of my favorite team fighting games.",2
"this game is totally amazing , its like a rebirth of the father of moba genre cool graphic and easy to play for some people i think there are no overpowered hero",2
"great game, free to play.... addictive and can be flooded with mixed gameplay as its 5v5 if you play pvp but there is also the option to play against bots if you dont want to get into those hair ripping anger moments when you get matched with a terrible team! but i have also made some great friends through this game and for that alone makes it a 9/10 for me because thats what gaming is about not just winning.",4
"i recommend dota 2 because its fun and its the originator of the moba genre. still, there are some bugs that need to be fixed desperately but its a really fun game to play with your friends.",1
"alcohol not only gives you the ability to talk to girls but it also gives you the ability to write reviews so this is my review while drunk. i like this game because yes.",3
"dota 2 is all about intensity and team work. you master this game you master professional life.",3
"just another  moba to be honest, games so boring and dull i spent over half my hours afk or alt tabbed or when the computer is on. i wouldnt bother with it.",3
"best game i have played to date. i would recommend, and since it is free, check it out.",4
"dota 2 is a great game. its very tactical. youve the choice of over dozens of heroes. everybody will find his own special one, for every different playstyle. its free to play and the ingame shop is absolutly fair and you need no items from this shop. all items are pure cosmetic. if you want to play this game for free, you have to know a person with free copies of this game. the alternative is to buy this game in the steam store. if you buy this game, youll get some special items for the game. but join a steam group for dota to find guys with free copies.",1
"great game, definitely recommend it to people that enjoyed playing dota 1. the transition is quite easy and the ability to customize in the market makes it very worth while.",3
"no matter how many times i quit this game, i always come back. playing since dota 1. almost 8 years. hard to learn, but still the best game ever.",5
"this game will never die. kudos to ice frog and all the makers since day 1 of the defense of the ancients up to the present dota2.",2
"great game for ruining the last bit of social life you try to save from the cruel internet. also the best foreign language teaching program on the world available. highly addictive to the point of self-destruction and getting severe mental disorders. 10/10 would recommend",1
"dont play a game with such a full of hatred, complainful and dull community. dont encourage games that are filled with people like this.",1
"play dota 2 to have awesome great gaming experience ever.",3

"played a few hours, now i am fluent in russian. 10/10 would recomment for everyone learning  language",3
"hello guys! just a short review of this game: there are literally 3 main facts to describe this game: it is amazing, exciting and supplies you with lot of fun! i never played a game that requires more skill, teamplay, and strategy at once than dota 2. playing dota is accompanied by a non-stopable learning curve; that means you get better over the whole time. bit by bit you gain experience, how to play your hero effectively, how to communicate with your team mates to defeat the enemies! and that it is! teamwork is the main proceeding in that game! and for this reasons it makes such a big fun! in the average a battle is 45 minutes long. one battle demands your full attention, as well as concentration: choose the right character, fight well and cooparate with your mates! try it out, i totally recommend that amazing game!",1
"a lot better than lol, community is pretty active and the grafics are awasome. dota 2 is complex, have a lot of feeders and latin f*gs and russians but is a great game! lol life steal : 50% dota 2 lifesteal : 200%",1
"this is my best free to play games on steam, this game is really fun to play with your friends, but the only thing i dont like about this game, is that some people who just get sooooo angry of a game of dota, so just train first or play with your freinds so you can learn the rules of dota 2. hope you enjoy the game. :d",2
"dota? no. dota 2. its different. game on. learn basics from reading guides, then try to make use of them to personalise your item and/or skill builds to make your game more enjoyable everytime. never fails. good luck! p.s. - wasnt a fan of dota/dota 2 before, but after trying, its awesome.",1
"awesome gameplay and awesome graphic to....addicted to this",2
"i like waffles. this game does not contain waffles. therefore, it could be better. 322/322 volvo pls add waffles",3
"dota 2 had been brought up many times in the past 1 and a half years it was only til mid 2014 i decided to give it ago. first time meh boring second time not worth my time third time oh my god this is actually quite good, words can not explain how dota 2 is fun you will just have to see for your self.",2
"beautiful visuals and stunning gameplay mechanics whith each hero having a complete separate function whilst having many hero customization options as well as being able to customize your game announcer and hud, this game is a perfect example of the moba genre and will keep you occupied for hours on end.",1
"my main enemies - pignoy please ban philippines from playing dota2",1
"while it can take awhile to get the hang of this game, as it has a steep learning curve, it is extremely rewarding when it starts to click. its a challenging game that is fun to play with friends. its not always going to be sunshine and roses, but it will keep you playing due to the variety of heroes and people that you will meet. also, what impresses me the most about this game is how balanced it is. there is absolutely no way for someone to purchase an item with real money that will gain them an advantage in the game. all of the items you can buy are purely cosmetic. and the heroes are all quite balanced, and can all be countered. highly recommend this fun game! dont be discouraged if it doesnt click right away, itll get better. :)",1
"game is horrible; too many abusive players. not a pleasent gaming experience but good graphics.",1
"this game has given me sleepless nights. i tend to play a hero and learn about its skills and practice on how to master the appropriate strategy. sometimes i fail because i let my guard down but it is still part of the game. the online concept of dota 2 is better since i get a chance to play with everybody. the all hero challenge is the best feature i think since i have to play all characters to complete the cycle. please fix all bugs on this challenge so we may be able to proceed and enjoy the game.",1
"best game eva. neeed more game like this from valve xd",2
"took me 5 minutes to learn how to move. then tried to buy items. ran into tower, died. team called me a noob and told me to kill myself. killed myself. team disconnected. went into new game. died again. repeated for a few hundred hours. now i dont die first sometimes. 10/10",1
"this game is . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (speechless) shut up and play dota2",2
"such a great game. if you like teamplay go and play. but pay attention to russians!!! (speacially brainless russians)",3
"once upon a time a russian in the other team told me peka you good. 10/10 vodkas would play again.",1
"worth trying out even if you initially like mobas. its free.",1
"if you have basic from dota 1, you should explore here.. quite different from dota 1.. atleast you have more friend to play with..",2
"dota 2 trailer is so awsome and this game is so cool i dont know why stupid lol gamers hate this game",1
"one of the best strategy action combat games out there. there is a huge learning curve and its not for casual players - so if youre planning on playing it - plan for long hours dedicated to learning everything. but once you get over that huge hurdle it can be insanely rewarding.",5
"fun for the most part, takes time to learn then you can dominate",3
"its really a awesome game! never expect to get addicted!",3
"ive played dota 2 for 8 years. during that time, i also played several another moba games such as hon and lol. the best things ive stayed with dota 2 that is its logical. and what i disliked dota 2 that is its hardware requirement. its quite high for a online game although dota brings us a beautiful preformance when max setting.",4
"arguably the best moba available and horribly addictive. ive spent more money on this game than id care to admit, but it is incredibly fun.",1

"once you get past the not knowing anything stage, this game is really enjoyable! just endure the first few games you play and be prepared to learn quickly!",2
"i so love this game! even before i was still playing dota 1, i was always looking forward to release this game so soon so that my friends and i will be able to play dota 2. having played this game is very nice. i would love and surely recommend this game to more of my friends.",2
"you will immediately nurture a deep hatred for russians",2

"a shoddily made pay-to-win event available only in short period of time, if you can get into it. when that timer hits 0 youd better hope the dota 2 network doesnt go down or youll miss it on the fun of people with more disposable income deathballing down your lane.",4
"new interface hero, hd graph, and so many event and item that make this game not so bored",5
"this is a good game and i very love to play :).. one problem is the supply is so fast the other items get lower prices now all crying cause they buy and when it sale it goes lower prices .. i hope the supply will slow down.. thanks any way! good valve thumbs up ... thanks for free game :) <3",1
"dota 2 is a moba game and is a continuing of map defence of the ancients on wciii tft",3
"in this game you can play as a guy who beats up mages as a guy who beats up invisible people as a guy who doesnt beat up anyone because hes just an energy ball and get angry because theres only russians and chileans and the mother ers just ruin everything and you want to be a good player once in your life but you cant because juan stole your farming without any shame when you needed money then you complain and he says asco and quits then you cry and try to find another match just to find juan again or paco always freaking paco",1
"do not play this game. at first it will seem fun, then you realize you suck at it, but you keep going anyway. ill get better youll say. the more i play the more i learn you tell yourself as you buy boots as your first item. before you know it, you are playing this game everyday, every free hour you have, itll be all you can think about. as you look into your iventory, steam has sent you yet another 6 invites, they are like a cancer, ever growing, each invite you send away generates another 4. your life has become dota2 now, and theres no turning back. great for improving your russian swearing skills though.",4
"cool if you drop a bundle or arcana for me. ive played for 200+ hours but i still got nothing. zzzz",1
"dota 2 is in a strong place right now. its rewarding and sociable like few other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. the next few months will be crucial: its currently the best expression of valves progressive attitude towards players, and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one were used to. thats the big picture, however. for me, dota 2 will continue to be about the friends that i learned to play it with, the ones ive made through playing it, and that ceaseless, pointless singing.",4
"i cannot tell you how much i love this game. one of the best thing s about it is its versitility: wanna play a casual game for 5 mins? sure play 1v1 mid lane practice, or a limited heros match. wanna play and extreamly complicated and intense game with 9 other players for 30-60 mins? go play a 5v5 all pick ranked match, or a random death match. if you are willing to study the inerworkings of the game it can be even more fun. youll also meet lots of new freinds! ^_^ and on top of all that its free. f-r-e-e, how could you turn such a great game down?",1
"for sure this is the best rpg game ever, congratulations valve for this creation! (5 stars)",2
"under no circumstances should you play this game. go for a walk instead. teach yourself guitar. anything but this.",2
"its a really great game, and although one may suck at it like i do, its always fun to play with your friends (and throw the game sometimes just to make them mad :d)",1
"in this game you will have to play over 100 games for hundreds of hours to get to ranked games so you can see just how bad you are. you will be put into matches with feeders who dont speak your language and flame relentlesly only to lose. noobs will call mid and feed and you wont have any map vision. be prepared to spend an hour on a game you will probably lose. 10/10 would recommend.",3
"awesome game for the people with good reaction and nice attitude.",5
"one thing i like about this game is that it can relieve your stress. i will definitely recommend it to others.",3
"- pretty much sums up all the europe servers in this game.",2
"dont download iz no league of legundz 0/10 wuld not play",1
"by far the king of all moba games, this is one of the most fun and challenging experience i personally have ever had in a moba. if you liked league of legends, you may find dota 2 to be a really difficult transition, as few things are similar. there is no surrender at 20 you play the game until someone wins. the game is time consuming, and exceptionally challenging. i would give it a solid 10/10",1

"this game was started decades ago and still has its crown on being the best moba and strategy game",2
"this game is by far the best free to play game i have got its an amzing game of strategy and teamwork i love it thumbs up",1

"dota 2 have good graphic and much feature like can speak with other ally using mic, and easy to buy item. but dota 2 just have little bit game mode not like dota 1 that we can set our own game mode like deathmatch with all random etc. overall dota 2 good enough.",1
"the best strategy game i had ever played in my life!!!",2

"its so fun.play this game to experience fun things :d",3
"this is without a single doubt in my mind the most refined and fullfilling multiplayer achievable to date. the game has a steep learning curve but once past, it leaves you want more every day. its free to download so this is a must try for anyone who proclaims to be a gamer.",3
"this game is a black hole once you start playing. no matter how toxic the community is, as soon as you put more than 100-200 hours into the game you cant stop playing. this will become your life 0_0",4

"kind of like league of legends but with more people calling me a  at the end game",2
"i like this game, it completes my day and earn more friends and teammates to play dota with other players. helps me alot. :)",1
"if riding around on a big hairy creature, bashing people with a hammer is your thing, dota 2 has you covered. sort of. dota 2 offers a huge array of characters that enable players to take roles that are in their wheelhouse. whether you like sneaking and ganking, smashing through the frontlines, or sitting back and supporting your team from a distance, there are characters that do all that and more. what immediately strikes me about dota, to coin a hideously overused clich, is that its easy to learn, but difficult to master. while the game is generally forgiving, the players are much less so. as with all multiplayer games, the experience of playing with others can be a bit of a mixed bag. the most important thing to remember about dota 2 is this: its not about winning, its about losing stylishly to progressively more back-breaking, marrow-sucking odds.",3
"relly good game guys i lve it but whan is gonna be a full version out?",1
"18+ :d for brainless people access denied :d this game is not casual :d if u were average in lol, go away from this :d there is no harder competitive game than this = means good :d",4

"its dota 2, do you really need a review for this? :v also, buy wards noob support _(:3",2
"i like this game because not just fun but it may gather you some aspect of being a team or learning about cooperation and understanding by your team",2
"i do not want to be a troll, but recently i have left behind lol to start playing dota2, and i do not regret this decision, since it has more in-depth at every fight when compared to lol. sure the community seems a bit more toxic then lols but i can get used to it, since all the time i do not write in chat and mute the flamers and wannabes. playing with friends its more fun then alone and more rewarding, especially the events or being in a team. one thing i do not like about the game is the cost of the skins and items for the events. they are way to pricey. but on the other hand there is always discounts at the shop. to mention that the graphics are amazing and optimized since it is running on the source engine. see you on the battlefield champion! ps: if you want to do solo rankings prepare to learn russian and how to delete dota from steam. do that at your own risk but i strongly suggest playing with friends.",2
"awesome game! if you tried it once and you dont like it, go home your drunk! if you like it and never played it before, play the tutorial, play alone vs bots, play with players vs bots and when you have played a few hours then try normal matchmaking. and always keep in mind, stay away from these russians....",3
"this game was there for me when i needed to waste time and vent out. definitely worth wasting your life on.",1
"great game, really fun and i love it style of doing mobas, with 4 friends this game is a blast.",1

"how to play: step 1: download step 2: install step 3: start step 4: play tutorial (optional if played moba before) step 5: choose where you are from step 6: start a match step 7: wait for the 10th player to finish for 5 to 10 minnutes step 8: learn russian step 9: get ganked step 10: get blamed for loosing step 11: train and get good/learn more russian 10/10 would wait for 10th russian again",1
"this game is fun and addictive and its the one and only game i have played when i was younger from dota 1 to dota 2. i recommend this game to you. but be warned it is very very very very addictive.",2
"at first i thought that mobas in general were terrible, i played the dota 2 tutorial and played ten matches then uninstalled the game. i really didnt like playing the game because every time i played i was shouted at and put in low priority. about a year later after my friends insisted that i play i started afresh and managed to quickly find my feet and dota 2 is now one of my favourite all time games. the steep learning curve makes dota 2 hard to get into but after you start understanding tactics and mastering characters it becomes an amazing game. the hundreds of characters, items, playstyles, etc. make every game fresh and exciting. if you manage to make your way out of the (noob/pinoy) bracket of players then suddenly the game opens up with possibilities and becomes one of the best games that i have ever played. it will keep you entertained for years and years.",1
"you will get addicted. best multiplayer experience ive had since halo 3 in its heyday.",1
"want a friendly community who accepts mistakes? want a team that speaks your language? go play an inferior game. want a game that is as rewarding as it is frustrating that is more in-depth and strategic than anything in the genre. this is your game. 10/10 would recommend to the serious gamers, not those who want a chill/laid back game. also you can kill donkeys.",1
"awesome game, but not for the faint of heart. the amount of trashers in this game is too high.",1
"this game is . gave me sickness. 10/10 ruined my life. still great.",2
"one map but this game creates thousand skills and experiences, godlike :d",2
"7/10 - game and community are great. if you are a newbie, play against bots. commmunity isnt noob friendly :( it became a huge turn off for me. the learning curve, compared to lol, is steep and youll be spending a lot of time learning the many champions in the game as well as game dynamics. give it a shot, you may end up enjoying it!",1
"this game has the most toxic community of any game ive ever played. i dont recommend ever playing this game unless you are in a party of five people who you know and enjoy playing video games with.",2
"you can beat russians, mexicans and north americans... then be friends with them. there isnt anything more rewarded",3
"this is a really good game, comrades, it makes you calm, strengthens the nerves, makes you more positive, you learn to work in a team, writing gg ez lalki after 70 minutes of the game, praising his comrades, even if they score 0 15 0, buy carrier 20 minute and play without wards ... yes, its a really good game.",2

"if you want a game where you can organize fights and win 100% of the time with strangers. this is not for you. aside from the constant trash talk and a very long losing streak it is quite and enjoyable game. for the first hundred games you will probably the feeder or the one everyone wants to pass the blame on. but as you get past that you either play your role to win or lose. want to learn some basic russian or perhaps some random language you never even heard of before. this is the game you komrad. oh yes you can always report random people for absolutely no reason lol!",3
"a rage-inducing strategy game that sometimes makes you loose faith in the world. other than the less than lack luster community, it is insanely fun once you get used to it after a while. the best thing is that there is so much to learn about this game, always new mechanics and things you never expected. at times some things do not seem balanced but almost always there is a counter to everything (there is even a counter to russians). over all a really fun game that requires some time to learn.",3
"okay...the best game in the whold world !!!! period",2
"great moba game but i have some complains, 1. it have micro transactions, i dont care if i need to pay 50 or 60 dollars to play this game as long as the micro transaction is reduced. 2. the graphics needs to be improved, its just not that good.",1

"dota2 is dota2,comeback is real and you cant predict what will happen next.",2
"its an awesome multiplayer game, which requires pretty good practice and skills. graphics are impressive too, and on top of that its free. it has a vast set of heroes and abilities which are to be thought of before being used against a specific hero. the gameplay is fantastic, i must admit.",1
"opened game. found match. chose random. got invoker. told to go mid. went midlane. told to uninstall. uninstalled.",4
"i had a girlfriend and money before this game. aside from that , the game is different from all the other free to play games. you get to choose from a huge amount of heroes and set your own way of playing. on top of a hero you use items to furthure adavance your hero. matches can be 5v5 or 1v1 and you can even do bot matches if you hate human interactions. pros ~hero pool ~abilites ~combat ~bots are actual not horrible cons ~not many different maps ~hard to learn ~fast paced ~cannot pause it overall 8/10 worth the price . free of course.",1
"dota2 lets you pick what servers you want to play in, but no matter what your playing with russians or hispanics. they will yell at you in broken english or in their home laungage, they well call you noob becuase its one of the only words they know. if you play dota2 you will grow to hate anyone that cant speak english. 11/10, would play again",1

"dota 2 is a moba game which is the so called sequel to the warcraft iii mod dota. surprising both old and new players alike as to how good it is compared to others or to its predecessor. dota 2 is a game which is utterly repetitive, who am i kidding? same map, same items, same heroes every single time but i never got bored or got sick of it, more like this is the reason i play it so much, to be better at the same map, using the same items and heroes at every other fight. (i play it weekly for about 8 hours, yeah 8 is my favorite #) all in all a great moba game, maybe the best. better graphics than its competitors and definitely more balanced in terms of both heroes and items.",1
"very fun if you like little children screaming at you while you lose and defeating people in super fun ways. all in all its a 10/10. pretty ok",3
"this game is ok gameplay, but you have to wait 10 minutes to find a match, then 9/10 people ready up, the last one doesnt, then you search again. finally, you get into a game with 8 russians and 1 screaming 9 year old. then everyone screams and hates eachother. 4/10",1

"everyone would keep yelling at me and i didnt know why, they would tell me to help and when i got to them they would yell and say go away which made me sad so i dont know why tons of people play it cause its not a nice game because people ruin it by not having lives and not getting off dota and just yell at you not help you like good people that are not real in dota because i dont know but its really not nice so get it if you dont have feelings and love to cry because your confused about what the game is even about, you can be a elf with a rifle or a robot or even a water thing but you will still be sad and cry so no fun for you.",1

"dota2 is the first reason for me to register steam. a perfect standalone software of the famous tft map <3 i told my friends to play this game too. if you are a fan of dota , you will be amaze by dota2s features. but you need times to level up and item drops are a little something(maybe im greedy). however, this is a must-play.",2

"outstanding!!! think: 5 vs 5 real time chess. this game is the pinnacle of strategy meets teamwork.",2
"if you like lol (league of legends) then you are gonna love this! dota 2 is said by one person a mix of chess and football. its quite true! the game game requires patience, timing, knowing where to attack and when, and working with your teamates. however its looks a lot more magical than other click-run games and i believe you aregonna have a great time with this game! (just be sure to play the tutorial first, lol) i would rate dota 2-9.7/10",1
"learned some foreign expressions. spent over $100 on this free-to-play game: simply 10/10",3
"why are you wasting your time reading the reviews!? start playing the game!!!",2
"dota 2 is a good game but i quit after i reached a point. the community really is worse. they are no cooperation at all. i appreciate some people trying to make the game a good game but the game is simply overrun by immatures or people who just wants to rage at others. as for people who are curious if they should play this game or not. my answer is: go ahead since its free to play. as for those who just wants to have fun, this game is not for you. people who play this game is not about fun but about winning. if you plan on having fun, i suggest go get other game or people will just insult you in many different crappy languages (that doesnt even exist).",2
"its goog game but it needs better matchmaking and servers without russians and ukraines if you chose english language :)",3
"i somehow have 27hrs clocked into this game. ive watched countless youtube videos showing how to play this game. thanks to my understanding of the various beginner/intermediate/pro level strategies/habits and a clear view of just how steep the learning curve is, ive essentially cowed myself into sticking with the training campaign for fear of being an anchor. i dont play anymore, but i love watching/critiquing videos. i just thought i should let you know that.",1
"every time i paly solo ranked: step 1: random dude in team says i will be your carry step 2: i play something that helps the team step 3: win midgame because im making space or plays step 4: my carry has 5k net worth, theirs has 15k. step 5: lose. step 6: the opposite team says wp only to me and lols at the rest. summary: my mmr is  but at least i feel ing good about it.",4

"dota 2 = chess between professionals lol = checkers between kids nothing more needs to be said.",1
"the developers are really updating this game allot, and the recent changed they made show that they actually listen to the people playing this game. because of the constant updating and tweaks in heroes you can get suprised in every game with a reaction like: does that hero do new  now!? anyway the game is really fun to play especially with friends. the game has a good tactical depth to it and people finding new good combos everyday! if you like mobas this is the way to go.",4

"a very fun game that can be super annoying at times but also very rewarding",1
"you wanna play lol? you better think twice and get your  over here.",3
"one of the best multiplayer online battle arena game; its gameplay focuses on combat in a three-dimensional environment, presented from an oblique high-angle perspective. what i liked on this game is that this is played in discrete matches involving two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. each stronghold contains a building called the ancient, which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. each player controls a hero character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.",1
"this game is a good game it will chalenge your skill in playing and you mind game you you dont have that you are surely nothing in this game exept if you play dota 1 this is mroe fan hope you will have a good time to play this game :d",1
"dota 2 is an over the top third person game. it is buy to play, for $30.00. dont buy the game but invite a dota 2 dispenser as a friend and follow the instructions to get the game for free. dota 2 has a lot of heroes to play as, and they are all free. the game itself is quite hard for new players to play with the steep learning curve of the game. thats why dota 2 has a mode wher you practice with bots. but sadly, theyre quite hard too. practice makes perfect, i guess. score: 8/10 stars. dont mind the professional players cursing at you for dying. just remember, they once were noobs too.",1
"stop reading this summary, ya fool! play some dota 2 kid!",2
"may cause loss of social life, severe anxiety and hate towards mankind in general and yourself specifically. 10/10 will be playing a lot",3

"outstanding game that addicting its player. like my own brand of heroin.",2
"dota 2 is pretty good it is pretty hard to get a item sometime you cannot connect to server",1
"dota 2 is a hardcore moba game with the high production value of a valve game, great graphics, animations and music. there are many heroes and items with interesting mechanics and many combinations between the two of them that can make the game enjoyable. having a big studio behind it and loads of fans from warcraft 3 times made it very easy for dota 2 to become an competitive game and e-sport, but for me is not enough to hide one of the biggest flaws this game has which is: rng. dota 2 has loads of items and heroes based on procs and other random elements which leaves many fights in this game to chance, a thing that i dislike so much in pvp games. dota 2 is a good game, but is not the pvp game im looking for.",1
"this game will take over your life, destroy your friendships, ruin your job and drain all your money. aside from that its great fun!",2
"palyed league of lol but ive switched to volvos doto because nashor give me immortal of the aegis",3

"some people take too seriously chill it just a game have fun",2
"learned russian , english language in 1000 hours . 10/10",3
"i think people who gush over this game do so because its not league of legends. this often strikes me as being the same as the person who plays say the secret world and bashes those that play world of warcraft. where world of warcraft is accessible, easy and enjoyable for the masses, secret world is deep, complex and very rewarding to those who really enjoy the minutae of figuring out how to get the most out of an mmo. dota 2 is the game you play when you dont want to the hand-holding, comfortable ease that league of legends has brought to the moba world. i found dota 2 to be overly awkward, and not particularly rewarding. but for those in the mood for the more hardcore experience, this is where to be, i just wont be there with you.",1
"smooth ui, great gameplay and new innovative ideas, like couriers and player specific markets place this game a head above the rest in the moba genre",1
"wew, its an good game if you want to try hard, try it if you can!",2
"i, for one, dislike the chinese more than i do the russkies. but seeing as how i capitalize their names, i suppose i dont dislike them that much. also, dota2 needs to be revamped in a dangerous, paradigm breaking way. thats the only way it can compete with da new crazuh blizzard moba with all that ghost ships and battle trolls.",1
"amazing game. dunno what i would do without dota 2 in my free time.",5
"the best game i ever play, meet other player from worldwide, different team, different skills. very good !",2

"ive played a lot starcraft like games and i really enjoy dota 2. it is by far one of the best developed mods that has a great community, and its free!",1
"first and for all, it is free. it has exciting events and activities which players used their teamwork and skills to achieve a certain milestone(s) for that event. also, this is a game where creativity among developers and fan users/players where introduced and expressed through designing items which are good.",1
"i ate a tree and my medical condition improved 11/10",1
"life is too good? friends are too kind with you? you have lost taste of begin mocked by random people? install this and play it a week. from the question of gameplay, i can say - this is not moba, its like tf2+csgo in thirdperson and you use mouse to move around and keyboard to shoot, simple.",3
"dota 2 is much better than dota1 :) i realy like it (y)",1
"brain enhancing game but we all know it destroyed our lives.",3
"this is one of my best game, because the essence of dota 2 is how you play with other players and how your mind works as a team. the game works is that five man team versus another five man team you gonna cooperate with your teammates the five of you will assume role team that will help making the team win, there is ten role and one of those will be your role then all of you finish the most important thing is..... had fun! :d",3
"this is the best game made in some time. it will take you a lot of time to get good, and its difficult, but damnit, is it good.",4
"only reason you arent playing this is because youre bad",1
"i have played for about 120 hours and im still at the bottom of the learning curve. probably the best way to learn russian, brazilian, thai, and chinese. 69/10 would always play again",2
"i used to play alot league of legends like 3 years or so ..i played dota 2 closed beta and i really didnt liked game because it was so bloody difficult.. but now few months ago i realized this is what is this game about . i really do like dota now , i am not playing league of legends anymore because it became boring without denying , loosing gold on death . it just feel to simple to me.. so yeah.. tl;dr : dota 2 > lol",4

"this is a game worth geting its like dota 1 only better if you play dota 1 then yo will love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"best game ever 100 000 000 peoples play that game :d",1
"way way way more depth than league of legend (lol), steeper learning curve, higher skill cap and alot more balancing / fair play. has some similarities to hon but overall feels like a really different game. i love both but dota 2 feels more competitive and has a bit more interesting heroes + the balancing is better (except riki). i would recommend this game if youre into something that requires you to actually think and use your brain unlike lol. i personally prefer hon out of all the mobas but that might just be cause i started with it, dota 2 comes close as second. 9/10",2
"if you dont like this game at first dont worry that is normal but you will come back to it like i did and then be addicted",2
"i must say its the number 1 strategy game in front of me...",1
"it will consume your life. you will never play any other game. you will stop talking to your friends and family. you will stop eating, drinking, and going to the bathroom. if you do not value any of these things, this game is for you.",1

"the best moba of all time. the history behind this game is, well, insane. icefrog, the mysterious legend. league of legends sprouting basically from the first version. the teams in the esports scene. dota 2 lounge, for commited betters of esports dota 2 teams. trading cards. enjoying the hours upon hours spent with friends met just dominating every match that you can. the thrill of playing new heroes and somehow feeling as if the same map is always filled with new challenges. this is a game that you just cant debate about. this is probably the best game i have played besides counter strike. another winner for valve.",5
"the game itself is good, had a lot of fun. but the problem with this game is that u are too much dependable on the people u get with you in matchmaking. apparantly you have too much people who want to play carry, and then fail at it, what results in a waste of time. it usually starts already a hero selection. people dont communicate, only play what they want to play and usually lacks of teamplay when the game is busy. too bad, because the game itself is good, the community is for 80% flamers, egotrippers, wannabe carry players, very rude",2
"literally almost ruined my life. give it a try if you want that.",3
"youll die, then youll live, then youll die and you will live, until you die. then, youll live and die, and live. and youll be treated as less than a dump-filled crap-bucket along the way. 11/10, would definitely recommend.",2
"this game brings online game to a whole new level. a game within 30~60 sometimes it might be longer but still, it requires a lot of communicate, teamwork, skills. there will be top players that affect the team fight but most important of the game is to  the enemy team down to the hell",4

"really great game. introduced me to mobas. very addictive and a friendly and helpful community. little confusing at first but fun once you get used to it. fascinating graphics and crisp sounds. gameplay can feel repetitive but theres always an element of suspense. each player hero is unique and powerful and the user interface of the game is easy to understand. does not constantly bug you for micro-transactions which is great. only problem is that finding a match, even on my closest servers takes quite some time (3-4 mins.) loving the game otherwise. 9/10 - the best moba",1

"makes you a racist against brazilians and russians, takes over your life, but is satisfying about 50% of the time.",4
"personally, i really enjoy playing this game for the most part. aside from the constant foreign rage and everyone blaming each other for mistakes, this is a really fun team game. sure, it takes a long time to figure out what each hero does and what counters what, but once you get to that point it becomes a fantastic game to play with friends. it really shows how well you can adapt to certain situations or communicate with your team to be effective and win the game.",3
"its a complex game with lots of champions you can play and its a lot of fun.",1

"great game, would recommend to my friends. besides the fact that its free-to-play, getting your friends to play, (or making new friends) is key unless you want to be stuck with annoying players who kick you for being insolent. anyways, the community is far from perfect, but it isnt downright horrible either. it is in my opinion, pretty decent to say the least. 11/10 stole my friends life and my life. he spent over a lot on this game.",1

"amazing! this game is definitely the best game on the whole of steam, it maybe free but thats great! this game is a moba but it is a very competetive enjoyable game with a fantasy aspect to it! lol or league of legends is a attemted copy of this game but they failed and dota 2 cannot be thought of as worse than lol because its a lot more fun and its a more fair type of game! get it now! if you want to",2

"the most fun in a game i ever had in a long time! amazing to play with friends or even alone. really well balanced game has a couple of flaws but not too bad. best strategic, action game on steam in my oppinion! try it out trust me you wont regret it! (russians keep connecting to eu servers)",1

"with this, you can enjoy the game and play with other peoples emotions aswell...",2
"defense of the ancients, best moba of all time and its simbly awesome strategy game, skills required!",3
"it is a rather good game that you can play for hours but in my opinion after a few days you get bored of it and leave it for a day or two it is a strategy game that i would say is the best one out there.(that i have played)",3

"ive just recently started playing dota 2. my friends always said that it was addicting and i always thought otherwise. i mean, what can be so addicting about a game. i thought that killing and dying is never really that fun. then i just kind of got bored and after 2 games i got hooked! i now understand how fun it is. addicting even. the graphics are nice. the response of heroes are great. the skills are appropriate for each hero. im just glad that i opened up to dota 2",1
"its not fun, its full of s, its very frustrating and youll never be good at it.",4
"i recommend this game if you are trying to become more familiar with russian language.",2
"approaching 2100 hours played...wow. while i do completely agree with the reviews that talk about how bad the community is, i have to say my experience of dota on the whole has been very enjoyable. the mute option is great, i insta-mute anyone talking crap. admittedly dota has an incredibly high learning curve, and you will often find high level players playing on noob accounts so even the early matches for new players can be brutal. if you can push through the first couple of hundred hours of games ;) and ignore the torrent of expletives thrown your way when you let the team down!; you will find dota 2 to be a: competitive, intense, challenging, and completely engaging experience.",4
"do you play league? are you sick of all the pugs and nobody will play with you? trade up and get an invite to dota2! the voices are amazing, the graphics, while beta, are very polished whily not stressing most machines, and the gameplay is an order of magnitude deeper in surprising ways. it is also the least-forgiving moba around (aside from wc3 dota, which has a more hardcore following and wc3-engine bugs). welome to dota, you suck. i know i do.",4
"great game bad sport players. i love everything about dota 2 except the people who boss you around and say suck a  every game. wouldnt reccomend because so many bad sports everywhere. the person said that because i coudnt protect ancient because creeps everywhere i did my best and what i get is suck a  how about you duck a .",1
"this game is free. not even  you. no runes, no grind, no . yes, game is hard. but dota 2 was built for both the casual and the hardcore player. also, you can watch other peoples games, which has 10 times the quality of twitch, but still sucks because it lacks the power of twitch chat. kappa there are only three rules. 1. do not die 2. song name is always darude -sandstorm 3. there is no third rule. download it.",2
"dota 2 is one of the most rewarding games you will ever play... that is only if you play well against the opposition wether it is bots or humans doing well can depend on multiple factors such as teamplay and soloplay. i would reccomend doing a couple of bot matches before jumping into online as the people you are with can be quite hostile if you screw up to many times. i would reccomend dota 2 to anyone looking for a fun challenging game that rewards you for every correct move. 10/10",1
"how to play: step 1: download step 2: install step 3: start step 4: play tutorial (optional if played moba before) step 5: choose where you are from step 6: start a match step 7: wait for the 10th player to finish for 5 to 10 minnutes step 8: learn russian step 9: get ganked step 10: get blamed for loosing step 11: train and get good/learn more russian 10/10 would wait for 10th russian again",1

"this game is extremely difficult to play. i am terrible at it. i spent more time watching than playing. i amassed a large amount of in game items. i did not know what to do with these items, since they were digital and did not exist in the reality i was born in. therefore, i decided to sell them all and make a profit off of people weird enough to collect things that do not exist in reality. i made a good amount and bought a few games during a sale. i got free games for being bad at a game!",1

"this is a game that is relatively straight-forward play, but takes a long time to master. the community is , especially if your a n00b, but if u play well with others, or just play well in general, youll have a blast. also, you cant be stupid and play this game well. you need a sense of cause and effect, and a sense of strategy. i would suggest playing with bots for a while, then once youve got the hang of things, public matches is a good idea.",2
"you can learn tatics stratigy and ability to be the best in game",3
"literally the worst game i have ever spent more then 10,000 hours playing.",2
"this game is truly amazing! you will have to stick with it for about 10 games before you begin to like it but afterwards it is a hardcore stratergy game, where you will have to work with your team if you have any hope for victory. i know from personal experience that once you have gotten into the game you just want to play more and with the new updates dota has really progressed and delivered a full fun game for everyone to play.",4
"dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. but once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. the fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. may the best team win. ps. dont play with russians",1

"do you like right clicking? do you enjoy the first 4 letters on your keyboard? do you love feeling utterly hopeless and lost for hours upon hours as you try to learn what the hell is going on? do you love russians? if you answered yes to any of the above questions then this game was essentially made for you. now i could spend hours verbally blowing this game and telling you all the reasons you should play it and love it or you can just download it yourself you lazy sod and learn why its the most played game on steam.",2

"dota 2 has a really steep learning curve if you arent familiar with other tower defense style games, which is discouraging initially. however it becomes very addicting once youve learned the vast system of items and characters that give the game great depth and replay value. i highly recommend playing cooperatively with experienced friends as it is a very team oriented play scenario and it will help you find your niche. there are so many characters and ways to play each of them that there is somebody for every personality. one drawback is that there is only one map, which gets monotonous. it is a very well devised map, however! share",5

"ahhh.... dota 2. this game is severaly unbalanced since no matter how well you play, your team will always blame you for the loss. it is also insanely luck based because the team that gets most russians usually looses. a lot of functions in this game are completely broken as well. for example, even if you pick english in the language bar everyone still speaks russian. sometimes german or french, but never english. playing this game i had a few mental breakdowns and smashed three windows in total. it sometimes feels like my life is fading away and i imagine life in prison with a really musculine in-mate would provide the same level of . to sum up, this is game is ing terrible. 10/10 would recommend.",2
"this awesome games that can change my live, great dota2 :d",5
"dota2 is something more than a game. it is a test. but that let my comment put you off. what lays under this very intricate, complex game is and experience you wont get anywhere else. it raises the bar on teamwork in multiplayer games. because without teamwork youll surely fail. and that is something a lot of multiplayer games try and fail with the self appointed hero player trying to show off. each member, including the npc are important. the controls, the interface will be daunting and put most people off, like me for instance. because the game itself is instense from the get go! but once you get use to the heroes you can play as, the lingo and system, that instensity that put you off, will drive you. dota2 is more than just a game, its a sport. and with all sports, you can make a great hobby out of it. you can have great fun. or you can go pro. oh! and its free!!! give it a go and dont be put off.",1
"yes it is a good game that i ever played ....highly recomended",3

"as of patch 6.82, this game has gone from an abusive relationship, to which i am treated horribly but yet cannot leave, to an absolute ing piece of . in an effort to balance heroes they completely destroyed my favorite hero phantom lancer to the point where he is almost unplayable. his new passive is useless, his new illusions useless, his new escape, ing useless. he didnt even need to be nerfed but apparently people buying gems or dust is too ing hard to understand. meanwhile drow and axe remain near unchanged, bane is op with agh, and countless other heros remain the same. however they did nerf sniper, so thats nice. but i am still left wondering why phantom lancer, why out of all people would you nerf him?!?!? i still recommend this game if you hate free time, yourself, anybody that doesnt speak english, the outside, and phantom lancer.",2
"its a wonderful game and one of the best examples of how to do free-to-play, but be aware that the community isnt kind with new players, which is a shame and i hope valve will not only continue to punish bad behavior, but also incentivize good behavior -- commendations are not enough.",1
"if you like getting sweared at because you made a mistake this is the game for you",1
"i love the game of dota 2 is using proven strategies and a good team cohesiveness, and there pitted 2 teams each containing 5 players, which both have major headquarters called the ancient and the first team to successfully destroy the ancient opponent is the winner, there are 3 roads or paths (called lanes) which connects both the ancient and forces (creeps) that spawn or appear regularly in these pathways, fight with creeps round opponent in the battle towards the opponents headquarters. and id like again there are a lot of options at the beginning of the game due to the chosen heroes, each hero has 4 skills and a few more (active or passive) so it is not too complicated to play, i love dota <3",3
"this game should be renamed dota: 2 easy steps to hate peruvians. in case youre wondering what those steps are let me break it down for you: step 1: queue on north america west or east with english only enabled. step 2: enjoy your gaming experience with peruvians who cant speak english past a preschool educational level. id rate this game 5 out of 5 bananas.",1
"this is a good game. for a moba type of game, i think it works very well. firstly the gameplay is sufficiently complicated such that items and abilities do not always have to follow the standard path, many aspects of the game is situational. at the same time, the game is fun and relies heavily on strategising and execution. playing online is great as it is a real test of skill and strategy. it must be noted however, that the online community tends to be unfriendly at times (as with most online games, especially this type). the customization of the heroes in game is a nice touch and i like it. especially since it helps ensure that this game is totally f2p.",2
"i need to stop playing this game *still playing* fuuuuu",3
"one of the best f2p game out there to play with friends.",2

"this is the worst game i ever played since the last bombing we had in africa and ye they should nerf the stun hahah like 5 sec much love barack obama",1
"a great game everyone should try, if they like league of legends. dota 2 is very similar to lol in many ways, with the gameplay, shops, and graphics. although, in lol you have to buy items, and there is no way to trade or earn anything. plus, in lol you get skins. in dota, you get sets, with individual pieces. you can mix and match to your hearts content, and get discounted items from the steam community market. a must play game! 5 out of 5 stars! <3",1
"this is a great game that requires inpecable teamwork and communication for a smart and decisive victory",2
"this game is addicting! i never played dota before and friend of mine tell me to play this game,dota 2. after spent an hours,now im really hooked with this game! really recommended!",2

"its a very fun team based game, in fact one of the best in the world.",2

"good quality and hero balance, definetely 10/10 for me",3
"nice game, entertaining and best way to be unstress..",3
"first im not verry good at english so sorry for that. i dont know if i recomend this game... its like a good version of leuge of legends but the bad thing is like all players speak russian and everyone call everone else noob and they can get relly mad and mean in dota 2 so it my favorite game bot if you cant take that you bing called noob and things like that then i dont recomend thes game.",1
"becouse of this game i have no freinds, am failing in school, my family hates me and i have no money. thank you dota",1
"dota 2 is a game ive been playing for about a year or so now, and i dont think ive ever been so addicted to a game before. its a game with teamwork, strategy and beautiful visuals. the hero pool has a huge variety of different looks, skills and basic stats. the game modes for the online mode are also cool, but i wish some people who play captains mode will actually listen to their teammates instead of just picking wherever they want to. overall this game is really fun to play and its free! i would definately recommend this game to people who have a semi-long attention span and a quick reaction time.",1
"after weeks and weeks of playing this game i discovered a lot of new friends and what this game is all about, why it was created.. and now i understand that people who are playing this game just not play like some ordinary video game.. but they play this game with passion..",2
"i love everything about dota2. this game has become my life.",5
"one of the best games off steam and valve. takes mental and physical abilities to succeed, but once you get the hang of it, the game is really fun. just remember to not feed the other team.",2

"best way to learn anger management, or maybe worsen it. 420/10 would play.",1
"you will never get the hang of this or fully understand all the ins and outs of this esport. it can be one of the most frustrating, annoying soul crushing games. but when it starts coming together and you have a good group that knows how to play together its amazing. unless you have 400 hours to spend on this game i wouldnt bother, because even with around 400 hours you will still be a fairly rank amateur.",2
"enjoy being called racial slurs? enjoy being screamed at in a language that you dont understand? take everything all too seriously? dont have a social life or interested in losing yours? then this game is for you. 10/10 completely ruined my life.",2
"i dont even know which option to choose for this review, that i recommend this game or not. seriously, this game cost me my life, my girlfriend that never existed, and step by step it will cost me my job. so if you dont have a life, i highly recommend this game for you, if you actually have a life, dont even try to think about downloading this game, youll lost everything for free. as for myself, this game bring out a horrible side of me that i never knew it existed. and of course, not much of a friendly community, but this game is very fun and too much addictive.",2
"dont normally play on steamm but this game is one of the best ive played",1
"its a great game with a really friendly community. just remember that if your team mate is saying  in chat, it means he thinks youre doing a good job and appreciates your efforts.",2
"please return lion to his former glory(as seen in my avatar) sincerely, everyone",1
"dota 2, the game of strange and interesting characters, use to fight for the power of unknown limits. this game uses the mind to the fullest, even in the parts of losing as long as u keep strong and dont give up, you can still push and win any game. use your abilities, tools and team mates to beat the enemy team and take towers, and eventually their base. this game is amazing, i have met so many friends while playing this game, it is fun entertaining and a down right game. but dont let that fool you, there are people who will fight and bring you down just for their fun. its free, try it out :) if you dont like it, just think you at least tried and now you know what games you wont like.",2

"the games beyond great, but some people just cant admit it. theyre afraid of the greatness of this game, that made me a junkie. the cost of this game is your life and soul, but at least you get to beat up russians. read: not all russians are annoying or bat at this game, ive met a few nice ones! but the nice ones are really hard to find. like, really really hard.",1
"this game has a multitude of unique heroes and abilities offering people many diffrent ways to play and create their own methods. although the game takes many hours of playing with bots and getting yelled at by angry players, if you put your time in this game it is very much worth it. i highly reccomend dota 2 for casual, competetive and players with much time on their hands.",1
"this is an amazing 4 gb game but it turned into a tumour on my hardrive constantly growing, it weights around 25 gb now. last time i opened my dvd rom bits of the game fell out.",2

"looking at the origins of this game and the fact that its free, this is one of the most awesome games there is! words are not enough to describe the true value of such a piece of art. only bad side is what at least used to be in left 4 dead community as well: our eastern neighbours. if they cant talk english, then their preferred language shouldnt be english! am i right? ooh, the echoes of agreement... they fill the air. whatever the case, 5/5 purily, cause salami is strong in this one!",1

"this is a great game for people because it shows the elements of chess and the spirit of basket ball. it is a very wonderful game that is welcome for everyone around the globe. i recommend this game for people with hardship and in need of strategic and financial help. it is a certainly wonderful game that is known and played by many people who never regret playing dota 2",1
"hey, you should get this because its free. ive put in 100 hours but im still kinda sh**",1
"what can i say about dota 2... great, hard, addictive game. it will blow you away when you start playing it with your friends, but you will need a lot of time understanding the hole thing and playing it good. if you played dota before you must try dota 2.",3

"awesome game. each match is different from the last. highly addictive.",3
"incredibly addicting. the gameplay itself is fun and engaging. it is played with a team of 5 characters with unique sets of skills and abilities versus another group. it is definitely a team effort to win the game. a single match would take about 40 to 60 minutes. customization of some aspects of the game adds another spice to the in-game play. characters costume sets, items, screensvers and skins and other dlcs which can be bought or traded at the steam market would keep the avid player own the characters. over all the game is exciting and fun. i give it 10 out of 10.",1

"this game is fun and entertaining if you actule have teammates to play with.... do not play this game solo you will get crushed by partys from opposing team who know how to make combinations with heros... but that is not the worst part of this game, the worst part is the fact that you will most likely get teamed up with russain players or spanish who are uncapable of speaking english language at all. i have spent two years in this game trying to find one or two good teammates, but all i found in this game is non english speaking teammates who keep kill stealing and blameing others for their own mistake. this game is no fun for me, its real pain filled with anger and haitred....",3

"the game is free so yeah, what can you lose? it can be fun to play but it can be horrible sometimes. and yea that depends on a lot of things. communication is the key and if u play casually you will find out that in most games no one speaks in your team. just pinging and commands. or they start speaking in some foreign language ( blyet) and that will not help at all. in the ranked games its a little bit better. the learning phase can be long but if you have some experiences with other mobas it wont be that tough. basically the game itself has no problems if you ask me. the problem is with the community of the game.",3

(no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",2

"after playing quite a bit of league of legends, i decided to finally give dota 2 a fair shake, and... well, i think i like it. there are some frustrations in transitioning from lols mechanics, especially when it comes to tower/creep aggro (very different strategy than lol) and overall champion strength, but the more i stick with it, the easier it is to avoid blindly falling prey to these things. i like that all the champions are free, with the ability to pay for non-effective, aesthetic customizations, not to mention the integration with steam workshop, to potentially get your own mods in the game. i still favor lol, but there is a lot to like here, and i look forward to spending more time learning the depths of this game.",1

"so, what can i say. i played original dota just a few times, so, when dota 2 was released as beta-version, i wast so agitated, as others. but soon i got an invite and began to play. so, what can i say about positive moments? + time moves faster - yes, thats it. too fast sometimes + a lot of matchups in each game + a good challenge for your reaction, analytics and tactics in aggregate + a lot of characters and you can take each one even at the begining + donations do not affect gameplay and some negative moments... - you need a lot of practice to become really good player - agressive community - it can eat all your free time",3
"too expensive to be worthwhile, no replayability, seeing as there is only one map. they didnt even try to expand on what dota 1 was, its like they just copied the game, changed a few mechanics, and updated the graphics slightly. riot please fix.",3

"i would like to say some things to valve. you see valve you changed alot of things in dota 2 , and there are some cool things and bad things . the good things are;bounty rune,the new model for shadow fiend,and the fountains. now the bad thing is that you changed a s*** lot of things which are bad . for example;riki,bloodseeker,techies,the map,e.t.c. but the most bad thing you did wrong is changing the map! why? i will tell you why valve . now in dota 2 there are many ganking heroes in the game like; pudge with his hook, sand king with his ulti+blink dagger, e.t.c.... my best friend deleted dota 2 because of this , and according to my chart , many dota 2 gamers have deleted dota 2 for good. think about what i said valve. commend me , add me , and like this comment . this is za afro and i love you all! p.s valve theres one more thing i would like to say to you , i love you too (no homo guys) goodbye!",1
"awesome moba game that its prior version sparked the growth of mobas in general. dota was a mod for warcraft 3 and soon became a major reason for the purchase of that game. dota 2 is a standalone that has better graphics and is still being updated with new heroes from the old game and with new game modes. it is fun for new people to try out since there is a tutorial system that teaches you the basics of the game. plus they also added a coaching system where you can directly talk with your coach during a game to learn things from them. very awesome game and it is free to play, so good reason to try out. graphics: 9 - awesome graphics especially going from the original mod sound: 9 - great sound gameplay: 9.5 - great gameplay, need so much awareness story: no story",2

"ruins lives. prevented me from studying for exams. my mummy got me a fedora and some dank after i got my 1st rampage which was 1 min in coz im asian. the long seating hours made my lower body jelly and immovable. plus the loong hours of masturbating over io made me run out of , thus making me unable to reproduce. this game made me learn 5 languages in 1 game when i selected language preferences to english and got russians, indians, koreans and other various languages. the dota community is so friendly that they called me a noob when i was carrrying the team and lead them to victory. this game is reccomended for people who have no life and dont give a  about wat happens in life. also good for people who like dank and porn bcause u can smoke this game and wank over it like i do. the flavour of the doritos and mountain jew when playing this game is so amazing it makes my brain fart.",2

"most addicting game ever. once you play it, youll never stop.",2
"possibly one of the most interesting games in my steam library, dota 2 is an enjoyable game to play with friends online and meet new people in the online matches. after the recent success of the internations 2014 by raising a whopping prize pool of over ten million dollars. this serves as an incentive for new players at the possibility to winning a share of the prize pool if theyre good at the game. one will require the ability to quickly respond to the situation as the actions of your teammates and enemies are completely random. i suggest this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable experience thats more complicated than the similar game league of legends. i find both games equally fun and enjoyable however dota is ultimately the more superior game between the two. ~samuraizheng",2
"great community game. can be played on a relaxing situation with all ur friends hanging out on ur house.",2
"i like dota 2 because i play for fun. and i appreciate other players.",5
"this is my favorite game. learn to play hard or go home.",4
"i usually play this game to relax and wind down because of its super nice community. it calms my spirit to be told to get rekt  and neck yourself you feeder nub. i especially enjoy it when super awesome pro players stream the games to twitch and say that their 5 viewers are laughing at me. classic banter. every now and then ill give back some playful jabs but im not very imaginative. my favourite lines are ill wear your skin kunt and your whorsish mother will taste your  blood tonight stain classic banter",2
"a good game if you want to test your reaction time and coorination with your friends or mabye random stranger. game is lots of fun but expect cases of rage and toxic comments but dont let that stop you from trying new things in the game.",2

"if you are new to pc gaming or rts/moba games, dota 2 will appear as impenetrable as a wall. the learning curve for this game is by far the worst element of mobas. however, those of you with some experience with rts games or are willing to learn will find the teamplay experience of dota 2 an enjoyable. would recommend to anyone with a competent pc and drive to play competitively.",3
"a very addicting game. though the community can make it frustrating at times.",1

"awesome game i get really addicting into it add me if you play!",1
"it is an amazing game but there are two very negative points about it. one of them, and the most prominant one, is the lack of optimization for the mac version. the mac version, simply put, sucks. it does not do justice that this version is so incredibly buggy on the osx operating system. plus, when moving the camera on the top part of the display when in full screen on osx, the game glitches as it is invoking the status bar.",1
"although im not a moba type of guy i can easily say that the only thing lol does better than dota is its rule 34.",1
"awsome game. every good thing is there in this game.",1
"this is no game - this is an addiction. its a very tough game which provides new stuff to learn even after 2.000 hours of playing it. though its very hard to get into game mechanics, it is a necessary thing to do a decent job in this game. but its absolutely worth it! dota offers so many intensive moments and chances to turn everything around, matches which are obviously lost or won... despite that, ive met some nice and precious people which i never want to miss again.",3

"i had a good time playing this game. every other review of this game says that it ruined the reviewers life and gave them, i quote, erectile disfunction, knowledge of many other languages, the ability to be massively racist and social anxiety disorder. no, this is not true. i played my first few games ,and whilst the community is appalling, managed to learn the basics. after a few more hours i had learnt to play fairly well and maintained my erectile functionality and friendships. also, it is a free game so give it a go. if you find an item, you can sell it for money. however, i will have to warn you that in many of your early games you will be matched with horrible people who will insult you and speak russian. ignore this, improve and help others.",1

"this morning. i had the offer to either have sex or play dota, i told her to wait until my game was done. dota will make you turn down sex. you dont want an abandon and the possible low priority hellish nightmare. dont download this game. youll say ill play one game and then go to bed and then youll hear that spongebob voice say 9 hours later and youll be like. wtf where did my day go. oh well i might as well stay up all day and play until tonight. its a monster. a vicious circle. it awakens inside of you and makes you want to kick small children, beat your wife, masturbate and open every door in the house without washing your hands first. save yourselves!@ you must look within! have a life!",3

(although if its a good match it can go on for a looong time)",1
"this game is much better than the warcraft mod dota 1 sequel. many improvements had been added. rare bugs, and sometimes a bit too laggy. its always up-to-date so to speak. a good environment because you get to play with other countries as well. unlike dota 1, you can only play at your country because connections are limited. graphics is awesome, the hero designs are cool, the music gave me goosebumps. but what bothers me is the end-game drop items that an individual gets, it should be improved, like increase the chance of getting an item, and fix the servers especially in sea. overall, i truly love this game. because it requires a lot of teamwork and communication in order to win. for me this is the best free-to-play game on steam.",3
