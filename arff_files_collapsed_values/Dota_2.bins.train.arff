"spending a year learning to shuffle a gaggle of fantasy heroes up dotas teetering stack of rules and game mechanics will do that to you: weve developed a secret language of our own, one that runs parallel to the talk of creeps and lanes and farm and rax common to everyone who plays the game. whack a ward on the donkletron im going to stick one up their jungle is a sentence i can say out loud and be completely understood by at least those three people. for some reason, theres also a lot of singing involved. its a lot like being a sailor.",1
"amazing game please play. no more league of lesbians",5
"awesome game, but has a very huge learning curve. which means you have to play a lot of games just to learn the ropes. if you are looking for campaigns or binge campaign mode gaming, this game is not for you. if you are looking for fps games that end in 10 mins, this game is also not for you. if you are looking for 30 mins - 1 hour real time strategy game, this game is for you.",5

"an amazingly deep game. community has the average number of s and such, but there are a lot of people who are passionate and happy to explain what to do next. this isnt a recommendation to check the game out, everyone should know about dota by now, but this is a recommendation to get past the first wall that scares many players away.",3
"maybe someday even i become a mother ill miss to play dota.",3
"strategy, teamwork, nastyness, epic, and awesome players. thats what you really want to see in this game. a game played with pros and newbies (noobs like me). playing this game makes you wake up earlier and stay awake longer. ou dont even worry about being hugry while playing (my parents should be proud of me because i am not wasting money for junkfoods and drain their wallets to feed me lol). there are also lot of things i hate about (not the game but the players). intentional feeding, intentional afk, intentional fs (whatever f has to offer). anyway, this game is great and i will still play it.",3
"1,587 hours on record for a reason. this game is more competitive and less childish than my previous game and train wreck of a dota-like accectable choice league of legends. yes the dota 2 community is rough but that is how it has been since dota on wc3. harder than usual to walk into and get going at first because of the vast knowledge of the game but replays can easily fix that in a day. overall great game and once again,  league of legends.",7

"now seriously, why would i waste my time with this?",1
"a game of calculations, dota 2 has millions of different possiblities to throw at you in every game. millions of different strategies, problems and solutions. every game is different. every game can be frustrating, beautiful, dissapointing, exciting, heart racing, slow, fast and much more, all within the first 20min. steep learning curve, do the tutorials and play through the characters if your new to moba. enjoy them, hate them, find what style you like to play, grab some friends even. there is something in it for everyone.",1

"1,400 hours in the game gimmie my life back could of bought a car a house gotten a girl friend had babies babies had babies could of been a grandpa but no i play dota and i play pudge",4
"as you might know dota 2 is a moba game, but despite the others games i think dota is better. you may ask why ? , the answer is simple : you can customise heroes for free and as you want, you can choose your favourite hud and announcer.now about graphics,they are really good even in low quality and imagine if in low quality are that good think how good they can be at high quality.dota has a darker concept for the heroes.and at last the gameplay,well,most of moba players are saying that is harder.i found it really easy once you learn the items and how that hero is supposed to go.maybe i found it easier because is a more strategic game than the other games.i can say only this except dota 2 ive played 4 other mobas and the most ive enjoyed is dota 2. i dont force you to play and like this game ,but i hope you will try at least to play a while and enjoy your play. good luck & have fun !",1

"amazing game. distracts me of troubles everywhere and anytime.",3
"fantastic game. endless fun. every game is completely different and always interesting.",2
"i need to stop playing this game *still playing* fuuuuu",5
"im still dipping my toe in this game. after 45 hours of playing, i still feel like a noob. this game requires a lot of commitment, and the learning slope is deep! but once you get the basics, its completely worth it. the game is like chess with a team. the hero you choose has a few skills, and determines what you bring to the table. then, for the next 15-35 minutes, and you and your team working together to beat up the other team. play the tutorial. personally, i played it just to learn how to watch the live-steams!",1
"home of the techies, russians, and all the kinky artwork you could ever need.",4
"dota2 made me addicted =x=~ i cant stop playing it t^t",5
"some guys was talking russian i wrote  they started laughing 10/10",1
"this game is incredible fun. apart from, well, when someone plays it. they play the easiest heroes that require no skill and when you try to play these heroes the right click carries that are complete and utter . jugg. riki. i used to like this game but all the heroes that were once good but counterable became even stronger and now you just sit and watch them kill your support. theres always the next update where they make their  carries an even bigger pile of .",3

"big learning curve but addictive as heck. better than league of bellends too.",9
"a lot better than bilzzard dota .. not only gaming experience, also community, items market & many more features we are experiencing through~ anyone who would like to play dota, wow, starcraft should try it too..! im strongly recommended but care of ur girlfriend not to lose ur attention to her :p",5
"pls dont play this game. it will make you want to muder; russians, peruvians, spanish, portuguese, friends and family.",2
"dota 2, the sequel to the award winning dota starring: sven staffani riki martin 2 puck stevie nyx jackie chen hrithik roshan slark walberg joaquin phoenix justin timbersaw justin weaver clinkz eastwood john lina jim carry tom tanks natalie supportman sarah jessica ganker alch pacino matt dagon christian bane ellen pudge ed harrass eddie morphling morgan fiendman snoop lion bruce lich ben sladar robert de ny-ro leonardo disruptio russel drowe dazzle washington mick jaggernaut 50 centaur malcolm axe orlando doom mirana kerr zeus willis directed by: m. night stalker stanley rubick coming soon to a computer near you",9
"i was a jamaican guy and when i healed people i swear he used a lil bit of ganja! great!",2
"very addicting and enjoyable. warning also mght destroy your life",1
"dota 2 is a really addictive moba. while i still love playing league of legends, i also love playing dota 2. dota 2 is more of a challenge then league of legends, which makes dota a really fun game to experiment with and have fun on.",1
"players are hostile jerks if you dont do something right or know exactly what to do, so new players beware old players are jerk and will behave like childern and throw and trantrum rather than help you.",1
"this game for long play , starting will be not understand how the game working or playing ...",3
"better than rosetta stone if you want to learn russian.",1
"only takes a few hours to get in the groove of things and then you have hours on hours of fun ahead, although in-game items can kind of be expensive, like 5 dollars for a hud skin? but anyway definitley one of my favourite games right now.",1
"ive lost all my friends, my family has abandoned me and i am highly overweight. all because of a free to play game called dota 2. dota 2 is filled with angry russians and nobody seems to speak english. i have wasted my life on this game and....i regret nothing. 10/10!!!!",4
"dota is great and really enjoyable game. do not worry if you suck at it, because even those pros who are being watched by thousands had to start somewhere. maybe youll be the one being looked up at.",6
"i was really suprised at how polished and well done this game is, the gameplay is perfectly balanced while the technological aspect of the game is just astounding and i specially love the voice-acting in this game, for example if you say lol or ty your hero will actually laugh or say thank you",1
"played game, picked support got one shot walked to lane, got one shot, cycle continued of me getting one shot until my team carried me to victory. was told to uinstall, happily uninstalled, would not recommend.",1
"ive only played this game for 2 hours and the friendly community has already begun to teach me russian greetings such as c and blyat",1
"i recommend it at all,only i sugest that you should introduce again high level rooms",4
"this is one of the best games you will ever play. it has a lot of heros to try out and it weill have you playing all day long ;)",6
"good game. for lol players it is/will be more difficult and has more mechanics. the gamplay itself is great and smooth most of the time you can play any hero you want without having to buy them. easy controls fun game to play with friends you can buy customization items which is great...perfect game wow defense of the ancients (dota) --> lol --> dota clarification of what came first",4
"good game, lot of people play this game. lot of fun, thanks valve..",7
"this is a fun game but very hard and i am terrible. 7/10",1
"if you want to lose the ability to have a scrap of life, this game is for you! so addictive, and yet sometimes you just want to kill everyone around you because you cant take it anymore",5
"for anyone wanting to play this game, prepare for it to suck your soul away!(in a good sense.) the gameplay is addictive and no two matches are the same. however, the gameplay is diffrent from most games in the sense of the stratagy and the skills of your hero. essentially, theres two teams of 5 heros in the game, and the battle out in 3 lanes, im not going to explain these terms, as thats something you should see for yourself, or reasearch for yourself if you want to know more. 10/10: game of the year all day everyday.",2
"i the jarl of whiterun recommend this game go install it.",3
"dota 2 is the best in the moba class. ive played lol, dota and some lesser known mobas and dota 2 is by far the best. in addition, it is f2p which is amazing. unlike lol or hon which require you to use a rotating hero list until you buy your own with real money or accumulate enough in-game currency to buy a single hero, dota 2 immediately gives you access to its entire library of heroes, for free. the only paid content are cosmetical items that do not change gameplay. graphics are great. gameplay is great. crashes are very minimal. its free.",1
"thanks for the free to play.. i really enjoy dota 2 :)",6
"i am done with dota 2 after 1000+ hours. sold all my 200 euros worth items. community to toxic... game is great but the fact that is free makes it so... bad when i started they cursed me every game for being noob, later reported me for good games. so many friends of mine tried to scamm me, so little honest and nice people. i will miss them. i am 27 yrs old playing games since i was 12. never seen so unfriendly community, so much rage, so much toxic  in my life. saying this after 1000+ hours and a lot money invested in a free game means something.",3
"this is not a game, this is a tournament sport. go in at your own risk, as this game is quite unforgiving and should be played with a full team. fun will be determined by how good you and your team is... not by overall gameplay. ignore the veterans that try to pull you in, this game is not for casuals... this is strictly a professional sport... if you want to have fun, go play something else.",3
"great game. addicting , with some stratagy with it.",1
"free to play made me feel unworthy to even play this game.",3
"have u ever dream? its a dream itself. full of despair and regret. but its all for u. u can earn respect by ur teammates, moreover an envy form the other team. you can be god. do ur best now. ure the one who can make this. u must shout yolo and do everything. as i always say hit or miss.",2
"the game is good! its better than hon an lol as far as i know. all you need to do is just learn from the recent dota then youre good to go! you can bet items and watch famous tournaments online. you can also make money out of this game. and the best part is that its free!!",8
"one day, a wise man introduce me into this game. it shall protect your virginity, my lad he said.",9
"this is one of those games that will consume your life. no matter what you do once you start playing you will always see things that remind you of this game. it is a curse. you have been warned. 11/10",4
"latest in torture devices from hell , dota 2 !! want to have fun? rejected. want to learn a new language? yeah,you can do that. (but only russian) #orignalmemes2k11",1
"once entered never come out of it 11/10 needs more of it.",3
"defence of the ancients is   finest multiplayer   . if you are        in to      .  .",3
"valve this game is fun and all but there is this bug that me and my friends get disconnected in some point of every game...you have to fix it! but its still a fun game",4
"learn insults from other languages with this simulator  bobo 10/10",3
"this is a very good game and it allows u to rage :) yaay",2
"dota 2 is a good game that improve our relationship to other people through teamwork and coordination but as the game continued few people tend to discriminate others or tend to be a racist just because of misunderstanding of the gameplay but if you disregard other peoples rude attitude then you will end up playing this game as fun and interesting! i recommend this game to the people who are open-minded and free of any bully! so play nicely and responsibly! have fun!",3
"9/10 best language learning program there is. 9/10 because it insnt a game, its an educational program so it shouldnt be marketed as a game ;p jk i love dota",1
"great, strategic game that requires skill! id love for there to be less russians on the uk / us servers, though.",3
"such game! much rage! very skill! wow! -games aight,graphics are legit you can run it without a need of a powerful pc,hero pool is like wow! by the time you master all of them youll also learn russian if on eu and brazillian if on us and some ching chong on sea oh and youll hear a few bogans on australia.in short: -common rage quits -low p 4 life -very team play -wow -best russian dictionary ever!",6
"its bassicly meth, ruined my life, lost all my friends, gpa took a nose dive, parents have no more faith in me, no longer have hopes and dreams, and its the only thing left i know how to do. but the high i get while playing has yet to be matched. 10 out of 10 would recommend to anyone.",4
"this game is the most horribly rage-inducing time-sink in existence. it will make you want to rip out your hair, plat some primittive form of garrote and maniacally stage an attempted murder of your bloody obnoxious teammates, who think they are some sort of almighty dota gods and just sh!t clutch-plays all over the bloody place! all, in all, its pretty fun.",1
"this game is amazing and i sunk hours and hours into it. you play on the same map everytime with the same possible items and 10 out of 100+ heros, but it is so different every single time.",3
"nice game, nice fps, nice player attitude :) good game guys, come on play now",5
"human revolution is a bit slow to start but gets really good after a few hours of play im a big fan of the futuristic theme, and the music is really good.",1
"awesome moba! i have tried league of legends too for a couple years, but having a much better blast in this game! lol is uninstalled.",1
"i love this game but one huge problem is the word noob how many people i hear saying that my/ there team is a retared or noobs or s if see one more of thouse words i will kick a cat >;d not really great game but i really hate the people who play it they give no support to the new players all they do is critersize them or just write this word noob omg i hate this word now :( yes play it if you are ok with a bit of online rude language :3",1
"almost 1000hs spend, and its still the best game ever!",9
"i love this game, always create new skill for make a good hero to fight in battle! ggwp dota 2",4
"cyk@ and axaxaxaxa are the only phrases youll only ever have to use to communicate.  dont be decieved by the server names, as every server is a russian server.  id recommend never to play this game with friends, as your friendship will be destroyed into tiny pieces.  phantom assassin is the source of all depression.  going into the depths of low priority is like taking a trip to hell with no way back.  you better be lucky if you random otherwise youll probably get earth spirit.  if youre afraid of rats dont play this game as theres a gigantic one named natures prophet.  pray to the lord that youll never be against spirit breaker because his name doesnt lie. but somehow i keep coming back to the game. gg wp valve 10/10",3
"its not a just game with strategy but its a medium of social experiment that can show you what the real you, consistency, mind, tolerant, teamwork and many other. its not just cm but it is you as crystal maiden",5
"i recommend this game coz` its fun and u can meet new friends from all over the world :d",5
"this game makes my nipples so hard that it gives me a boner, plus this game is better than lol but starcraft is the best dota dota dota oi oi oi",5
"this game is wonderful and i love to play dota 2 :). i prefer if every of my friend can start playing dota 2 because online games are very amazing.",3
"if you love people screaming at you for not co-operating first and making your strartegy,playing against competitive people next then this is the game for you. hope you people wouldnt mind getting addicted to a game and all",5
"hate this game. thats why i play it everyday. ruins your life. 11/10",4
"should i review this? free and fun. no need to be a pro",1
"its an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. it took me a long time to warm up to, but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. if you can spare the time - play it.",4
"^ just look at my recorded time, it says everything. :)",7
"this a game that i have play religiously for over 1600 hours, a game that i have litterally spent years playing. i have a love hae relationship with doto. if you can manage to get to a less toxic mmr lvl and play with competent team oriented players then you will abosolutely lover everything about it. everything is a learning experience and no matter how much you think you have mastered the game, you havent. it is definately worth your time aslong as you are willing to dedicate the rest of your life to it. its something it is hard to play casually and its hard to stop after one match.",7
"yeah.. i really injoyed playing this game.. ilike the graphics work..nice..",2
"im 24 hours in and still dont know what im doing 10/10",3
"do you play league? are you sick of all the pugs and nobody will play with you? trade up and get an invite to dota2! the voices are amazing, the graphics, while beta, are very polished whily not stressing most machines, and the gameplay is an order of magnitude deeper in surprising ways. it is also the least-forgiving moba around (aside from wc3 dota, which has a more hardcore following and wc3-engine bugs). welome to dota, you suck. i know i do.",7
"it is an amazing game to play, ive had a lot of fun playing it",2
"how many russians can fit into a single game is the real question here",4
"hark, mine name is brooklyn kurtz see mine face, thy eye avertz life cursed of fire, in hurtz",5
"dota 2 is a moba with a high skill cap. the meta game of purchasing helpful items is complex and hard to get accustomed too. once you do, however, the game is great fun especially with a group of friends!",3
"never gonna give you up (because it will count as an abandon) never gonna let you down (because the community will kill me) never gonna run around (because someone will insta-kill me) and hurt you (because i am never able to kill anyone!)",1
"this game made me think one thing. if you dont speak english you dont deserve a computer. 10/10",2
"probably the only game where you could get reported for not speaking russian... when you have queued for the english speaking servers.",8
"good game, but if all the heroes will be here, this game will be really good.",2
"an awesome game to play with friends and as its more competetive now a days its even better to go pro and show the world how good you or your team is...........must play !!",1

"an accurate representation of the austim spectrum.",7
"some people take too seriously chill it just a game have fun",4
"dota is pretty phresh, wide variety of heroes and keen to see more <3",1
"good strategy, teamplay game. can be quite addictive and sometimes frustrating. dont rage or type on cyrillic and youll have lots of fun. recommended 10/10.1",5
"this is great. so far, only filipinos having bad english ruin the game. id recommend this for one reason, no maphacks. itd really improve your game.",1
"dota 2 is a bad game and it sucks really. the players are mostly noob. dota 2 depends on the strength of heroes not on the skills of the ones who played it. even the matchamaking system is imbalanced. everytime i play dota 2 its like my team is 40% and the enemy is 60%. which is really imbalance. also dota 2 has a very bad impact based on item cosmetics. here in our poor country this became a huge issue. i hope they ban dota 2 in the philippines",1
"very fun if you like little children screaming at you while you lose and defeating people in super fun ways. all in all its a 10/10. pretty ok",5
"sooner or later you will realize that no matter what language options you pick, or what servers you pick, you will be qued up with people who spamm the chat and voip with russian, spanish or portugese. as long as valve wont lock regions i would not recommend this game, as it will cause you more grief than fun.",1
"this is a great game but sometimes i meet many rude and noob player otherwise some or them also quite friendly , anyway dota 2 still a very nice game hope this game will more be like by other ^^",2
"wew, its an good game if you want to try hard, try it if you can!",3
"1) set server region to europe west 2) language preference - english only 3) find a match 4) realise that 5 people in your match are russians 5) get reported by them for picking riki 6) quit rating: ca/10",2
"lots of fun, you need to be ready for some verbal aggressiveness though... ;)",6
"do you want to get so angry youll storm out of your house and swear youll never play video games again, but develop an addiction so powerful you wont be able to resist coming back in 5 minutes to keep on chasing the high a win gives you? do you want to develop an irrational hatred of russians, and peruvians so strong that if you ever encountered one on the street you would punch them in the face without another thought? then this game is for you.",4
"do not ride bat into battle comrade, instead ride bird.",1

"dota 2 is for certain the best moba game on the market. completely free to play, with all heroes unlocked from the start. plenty of patches have changed how characters work, added different events, and added more heroes to play with; making it a great package for the price of... well nothing! if you are new to mobas; dota 2 may be a hard game to get into due to the high learning curve. do not have that discourage you however, as plenty of hours are waiting to be taken by this fantastic game.",1

"possibly one of the most interesting games in my steam library, dota 2 is an enjoyable game to play with friends online and meet new people in the online matches. after the recent success of the internations 2014 by raising a whopping prize pool of over ten million dollars. this serves as an incentive for new players at the possibility to winning a share of the prize pool if theyre good at the game. one will require the ability to quickly respond to the situation as the actions of your teammates and enemies are completely random. i suggest this game to anyone who wants an enjoyable experience thats more complicated than the similar game league of legends. i find both games equally fun and enjoyable however dota is ultimately the more superior game between the two. ~samuraizheng",3

"i like the battle field and the strategy you gonna use to win",1
"this game has taught me so much things that ill never forget : 1- the only good russians are always on the enemy side. 2- that the whole dota community would defend ukraine against russia. 3- that brazilians dont only suck in football, but in dota2 too. 4- in low priority games, your whole team is always full of hard carries. 5- that excuse in which a feeder blames lag is overused. 6- oh 2 russians in my team ? gg wp every single time. good game, taught me how to swear in russian !",4

"best strategy with the worst player shuffle balance system.",1
"dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. but once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. the fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. may the best team win. ps. dont play with russians",1

"at the moment, i have a whooping 1000+ hours spent on dota 2. dota 2 itself is the stand alone placement after dota, a wc3 custom map, which has been getting reworked with a new graphic and engine, that can support future updates to the game. in total, dota 2 is very addicting, with its system of free to play, with no buff for premium player, because the only thing you can buy in game is just cosmectics, so users with cash will not own you like in the other f2p model game. so, dota 2 is really worth it, and hopefully it will be upgraded into betterment in the future, as well as become the best e-sports in the world.",8

"its such a team game, at times can be the most fun ive had since mw2 back in jr. high and other times it can be the most brutally antagonizing game ever, very love-hate, but all in all its a great game, can be a little addictive and a bit of a home wrecker at times, and when it says free to play it truly is free to play, though to stand out in the community you can make in game purchases that will change the default model of your selected hero... great community, though sometimes it can match you up with people who cannot speak the same language as you for in most cases us servers are a better choice for those closer to the borders of the us ie canada and mexico. and if you plan to have a decently ranked 5 man team you better practice cause next thing you know your matched up with a 5 man korean team that will make you regret ever inviting the 4th or 5th player.",3

"a rage-inducing strategy game that sometimes makes you loose faith in the world. other than the less than lack luster community, it is insanely fun once you get used to it after a while. the best thing is that there is so much to learn about this game, always new mechanics and things you never expected. at times some things do not seem balanced but almost always there is a counter to everything (there is even a counter to russians). over all a really fun game that requires some time to learn.",6

"dota 2 is many things to many people: its a great way to kill an afternoon with friends; its a spectator sport platform with its own item-betting scene; its a hobby; its a profession, and a way to make a living. it isnt perfect and likely never will be, as each update tends to fix bugs and introduce new ones, and the tutorial could certainly use some work. however, with zero cost to play and one of the highest skill ceilings of any game ive ever encountered, dota 2 is a modern multiplayer masterpiece.",7
"most addicting game ever! feeds the strategic and tactical craving. only problem is the competition is fierce, friendships will be lost, but new ones will be gained. playing it too much can turn you into a  sometimes. but moderation can turn you into a leader. definitely my favorite game up to date.",8

"an interesting proposition. unlike most games, this is the gift that keeps on giving. over the lifetime of dota 2 many additions have been made, and many continue to come along. dota 2 is based on an old warcraft mod, and on a weekly and monthly basis, valve continues to update and add features to the game. aside from being a lucrative scene for competitive gamers, it also has a steep learning curve and endless combinations as far as team compisitons go. if you arent the kind of person who likes to play versus other players, the game allows you to play cooperatively against bots. and to further add to the lifespan of the game, the developers release festive events every 3-5 months to add something extra for players to do. as the game is free to play, this game can potentially net you some gains in the form of the marketable items you recieve for playing.",3

"the greatest game ever made. at face value its just another top-down video game, however once surpassing the initial learning curve the depth of this game is second to none. the animation is perfect, the voices are pristine... however every game has its flaws. the community is horrible, there are numerous bugs and thats just grazing the surface. that being said, i never recommend this game to friends as once you pass that learning curve you wont be doing anything else once it latches on.",5
"better graphics and in-game models than all other warcraft sequels. steam should host more games by valve. great work.",4

"as the moba genre began to rise to the spotlight of the gaming community. i decided to give it a try. i first tried league of legends, but was yelled at for being a noob and rage quitted. i thought this kind of behavior was counter-productive, because a gaming commmunity should be supportive of noobs....because even the gaming legends start as noobs as some point in their career. so i got frustrated, and didnt touch mobas for a while. however, im in deep love in valve and everything they do, so when i heard about dota, i got interested. when i completed the tutorial, and finally joined a game, everyone was helpful and willing to assist a noob to a very complicated and intricate genre. i still suck, as i play off a kind of beginners intinct and not off of a knowledge of the game. however, dota, with its compelling art style, helpful community, and a touch of gaben, blew lol out of the water for me.",1

"this game is play much by myself, but i feel it lacks in abillites and champion roles in the sense that it really doesnt have much varity in how you build your champ/hero as a build can work in just about every situtation. this my seem like a major nark on the game, but id say its rather good besides that one part. it has good graphics and a fairly good champ/hero pool. i would say try this out if youre content on not play lol and games like this, but if youre open to the moba lifestyle try lol first honestly. 3.5 out of 5 stars for gameplay. 4.5 out of 5 stars for pc controls",1

"steep learning curve, but once you invest the time to not suck then it is a pretty addictive and fun game. the teamwork aspect of it is what makes it and/or breaks it if you are unlucky to be paired with a feeding player. that said, if you can find a small core of people that you consistently play with then win or lose it is a pretty awesome game. oh, and dont use riki or sniper unless you have to. just trust me.",5

"dota 2 is incredibly fun, although it may not seem so when youre sitting through that awfully slow paced tutorial, and your first few games may seem overwhelming. tough it out, its worth it. once you learn to play a hero or two and you know a couple items to go with those heroes, youll do fine. dota will show you that the only thing you were missing in your life is being screamed at by people in russian/porteguese despite you already make it clear that you only speak english. pro tip: no, playing on us servers does not solve this problem, apparently every russian/portuguese speaking person decided to play on us servers despite the awful ping and they dont know the mainstream language here.",2

"this game is clearly a great game on the steam store and its free to play....what else can i say? sometimes online is smooth, depends on wifi connection and your opponents wifi too. the games not noob-friendly but you gotta get the hang of the damn game, they have something called practice and youtube guides. yeah id definetely freaking reccomend this game no matter what. its very addictive especially once you get the hang of it. my favorite characters are sven and zeus, theyre pretty good. i personally think ursa and sniper are overused, so you may wanna use some underused characters like death prophet! >:d have fun playing! if you see me online gimme a haiiiii ;d (note: im an average dota2 player. im not an expert nor a noob. you have been warned.) ;3",4

"it will consume your life entirely, setting you back at least one year, condition you to feel anger towards other cultures when you hear someone speaking a different language, and, cause you to spend a lot of money on making your heroes fancier. it wont let you have a relaxing game when you have down time, let you enjoy any other game ever again, nor let you feel good about yourself. youll have dreams of going pro, youll claim mmr doesnt matter, and then youll realize youre a terrible 3k scrub. but youll be okay with that, go mid and feed. 10/10, would fall into addiction and be consumed again.",10

"before trying out dota 2, i did not really like moba overall. until my friends persisted that i tried and i was glad i made that choice. dota 2 is a great game that really requires teamwork(like every moba), but it just has this special feel that makes this f2p game a must play. it has awesome graphics and smooth mechanics and one should definitely not miss out on this game.",3

"much better than lol in so many ways for example the item system in dota is way better than the skin system in lol because you dont have to play in order to get some nice items and in lol u will have to invest money in order to get skins, so thats a big reason why i love this game more than lol. another reason is that i love graphics and since the graphics in dota are really sexy i find this a better game already (xd). but without comparing i really love the game because its so strategic and fun in many ways and im addicted to it. i think this game will atleast give me a couple 100 to maybe a 1000 hours of fun! so if youre thinking about downloading the game.. just click that green button already c;",1

"by far the king of all moba games, this is one of the most fun and challenging experience i personally have ever had in a moba. if you liked league of legends, you may find dota 2 to be a really difficult transition, as few things are similar. there is no surrender at 20 you play the game until someone wins. the game is time consuming, and exceptionally challenging. i would give it a solid 10/10",1

"11/10 where teamwork is  and u dnt knw what you are doing",1
"the moba equivalent of getting kicked in the , repeatedly, for hours on end, until little remains of what could resemble genitalia. however, the truly astonishing part, is that this wasnt torture, but done through your own volition; you wanted to made miserable. hell, you probably paid for it a little. every game brings such traumatic pain and anguish, this game should be considered a war crime. psychologists have analyzed why dota players put themselves through this kind of hell, and all tests have come up inconclusive. this game has caused the perpetual virginity of thousands of people. friendships have been ruined, careers lost, and marriages have ended, all because of this game. dear god, get rid off this awful blight on humanity. only the dead can know peace from this evil... 10/10 i recommend this game to all my friends!",2
"this game is ing garbage, there is a reason it is being sold for 2 cents on the steam community market, the gameplay is bugged to , the graphics are total garbage, the community is worse then ing cod. while i played i could here two ing ers on the mic having anal sex in monkey talk and i couldnt mute them because this  game wouldnt allow it. league of legends is so much better. dota 2 devs, get on riots level",1

"i played league of legends for 2 years before finally switching to dota 2. it is better in basically every way. huge learning curve (im still a total noob after 250+ games) but almost always fun. the amount of possible plays you can make with various heroes/items is basically infinite. the best pvp game in many years.",5

"dota 2 is by far the hardest to learn game i have ever played. however, it is one of the most fun. if youre new to dota, and you want to get better, you have three options: 1. practice bot games over and over using a ton of guides and such until you can consistantly beat unfair bots no problem. 2. play a ton of games with more experienced friends (this way is the most fun). make sure that theyre close friends, because they will teach you, but if you dont listen to them and keep dying or buying bad items or whatever, theyll hate playing with you. so listen to your teachers! 3. play games on your own and try your best, and end up being yelled at by four different people at the same time (9 if youre lucky). but if you get through the learning phase, this game becomes amazing. its an awesome strategic game to play with friends. youll win some and youll lose some, but its free and fun, so what the heck.",1

"the game is free so yeah, what can you lose? it can be fun to play but it can be horrible sometimes. and yea that depends on a lot of things. communication is the key and if u play casually you will find out that in most games no one speaks in your team. just pinging and commands. or they start speaking in some foreign language ( blyet) and that will not help at all. in the ranked games its a little bit better. the learning phase can be long but if you have some experiences with other mobas it wont be that tough. basically the game itself has no problems if you ask me. the problem is with the community of the game.",6
"im not a fan of league of legends or steampunk legends. but dota 2 (i dont know why) has a diffrent feeling when i play this game",1
"this was awsome! it seemed we were on a weaker balance but with nice tactics and good timing of pushing and defending we were able to take out the game. players are somehow a bit too extravagant on using this sensitive word noob when they believe the other player failed to comply of what he had wished. however, blaming comes naturally in a game for winning and losing. at least no other bad words came out. it was a good one generally. cheers,",2

"well for starters, take a look at my total hours played. that should tell you how much i like this game. i honestly find the idea of a moba very appealing. although there might be other games out there in the genre that (dare i say it) are better than dota 2, i still find dota 2 to be the one game i always go back too. the game mechanics are solid, the character balancing is always changing, adding new depths to the gameplay, and many of the players in dota are relatively laid back. is dota 2 the best game in the world? probably not. is dota 2 the game i have spent 1000+ hours on and will probably spend another thousand on? absolutely.",7

"really good strategy game! p.s:better than lol (league of legends)",1

"this game is gr8 it involves high skill in feeding figuring out different ways to killsteal my favorite pressing r as zues creating different senarios where you can never relie on your teammates to help and it is also educational it teaches you the beautiful language of the motherland here are some quotes from some of my teammates f*ck you noob-    why you so noob-    noob sh*t head-   feeder f*ckwit-    in conclusion gaem iz gr8 8/8 m8 :)",2

"this is very high quality game. graphics are very detailed and good. but still, you can play on low quality and enjoy. the thing about this game is, that while starting , you wait too much time : match searching and player waiting. players often fail to connect. second thing, if you like rpg games, the fact that someone can be first and take the hero that you like, want will be terrible. and to be short, if you dont have enough free time to spend (40 min-1hour) on match, dont start it, if you leave , you wll recieve abandon and ruin your teams game (butin reality no one knows is it ruining or helping , couse in late game, money is everything and your money will be spreaded between your teammates). so yea you should try this game if you like competition and sometimes rage :)",1

"many people argue about wether dota 2 is better or league of legends. i play both (dota more) and i wouldnt say dota is better. there are many differences between the games and the main one is strategy. in league of legends vision is required and map awareness is essential however in dota, position matters a lot more than lol. since the 4th minute on, in dota everybody is ganking around the place and tp supports are coming in to survive ganks. in lol it is a lot simpler. farm, kill, push mid. in dota you have to think, constantly watch the map, counter draft, counter build, position yourself and rotate correspondingly. in lol there are many lacking features such as, vision obstruction (hills and trees) missing, diverse range of active items and ability types. if you want a simple, just play game go for lol, but you are a a strategic player and look for osmething that truly tests your skill id recommend dota 2.",2

(y) this game more easy than dota @ warcraft iii. the character model so nice and more cooler! if you have a good pc or laptop try play this game! and 1 more thing, dont care about player says you noob or something. if you keep playing this game, you will became pro. alot player dota 1 know how to play this game. rate : 10/10",2

"easilly the best game around! fast paced tower/base defense with enough challenges to keep me playing for years to come :)",3
"steep learning curve, but once you invest the time to not suck then it is a pretty addictive and fun game. the teamwork aspect of it is what makes it and/or breaks it if you are unlucky to be paired with a feeding player. that said, if you can find a small core of people that you consistently play with then win or lose it is a pretty awesome game. oh, and dont use riki or sniper unless you have to. just trust me.",5

"this is an amazing game - brilliant for strategy and teamwork, or even to just mess around on with some friends, i highly recommend this game to anyone with a sense for a good ftp online game",6
"this game is play much by myself, but i feel it lacks in abillites and champion roles in the sense that it really doesnt have much varity in how you build your champ/hero as a build can work in just about every situtation. this my seem like a major nark on the game, but id say its rather good besides that one part. it has good graphics and a fairly good champ/hero pool. i would say try this out if youre content on not play lol and games like this, but if youre open to the moba lifestyle try lol first honestly. 3.5 out of 5 stars for gameplay. 4.5 out of 5 stars for pc controls",1

"the greatest video game in the history of time and space. ...is what dota 2 turns into, after youve done 50 hours of boot camp and 50 hours of homework. before that youll be shocked and confused and humiliated more times than you can count. in the end the investment is well worth it, just be warned youll need enough time and thick enough skin to survive the trial by fire.",1
"this game would be great if all russian players were removed.",3
"stay away from this game, if you still want to have a life :p",2
"mobas havent been my thing really. before i loved mmorpgs with a passion, until a friend of mine introduced dota. and well it was worth my time, i have been hooked ever since. i may have stopped for a while, but eventually youll come back to the game regardless of how good your current game is. 10/10",9

"great game if you want to ruin friendships and get really mad at russians.",5
"dota 2 has a really steep learning curve if you arent familiar with other tower defense style games, which is discouraging initially. however it becomes very addicting once youve learned the vast system of items and characters that give the game great depth and replay value. i highly recommend playing cooperatively with experienced friends as it is a very team oriented play scenario and it will help you find your niche. there are so many characters and ways to play each of them that there is somebody for every personality. one drawback is that there is only one map, which gets monotonous. it is a very well devised map, however! share",9

"dota2 is hard to pick up, it has quite the learning curve. completing the tutorial will not get you ready for online play, and like any team based game youll get a lot of negative feedback from your team mates just for being new. dont let this discourage you! everyone started fresh at some point, take it with a grain of salt. there are over a hundred heros to choose from. i recommend playing a few games, seeing who does well and what you like about that here, then looking for other heros to start playing with. there are great hero tutorials all over the internet, if you have your eye on someone, check out a video of a pro playing them. itll help you understand what makes that hero great. dota2 is a great game, and ive met some really cool people in my short time playing. practice makes perfect, and this game is no exception.",4

"one of the best multiplayer online battle arena game; its gameplay focuses on combat in a three-dimensional environment, presented from an oblique high-angle perspective. what i liked on this game is that this is played in discrete matches involving two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold at a corner of the map. each stronghold contains a building called the ancient, which the opposite team must destroy to win the match. each player controls a hero character and focuses on leveling up, collecting gold, acquiring items and fighting against the other team to achieve victory.",2
"this is the worst game ever. it made me fail in my exams. it has awakened a great hate for russians in my heart and made me want to yank my hair out when someone doesnt call ss pudge. recommended for players with high tolerance and patience and if a russian is reading this then to the russian this game sucks alot and dont play it. no matter what u read below or above, this game is very bad for muther russia so stahp downloading it. now ",3

"this game is extremely fun to play. very team-based, but it still involves a lot of player skill. dont be discouraged if you play your first match and die 20 times. this game has a very large learning curve, and you will become a good player with practice. i recommend playing a game with bots before you play against players. this gives you an idea of the mechanics of the game, as well as some of the heros abilities. overall, a very great game...and free!",3
"this game gets better and better.keep up the good work valve.we will always support your games because its all good and fantastic.",2
"an accurate representation of pubbing in this game would be to imagine yourself trapped in a sewer swimming around eating nothing but turds your entire life, each turd represents an average public game. now imagine after all of those turds you go to eat the another one and to your surpise it is a chocolate bar, it is the best feeling in the world. that chocolate bar represents those occasional games where everyone is evenly skilled and tastes so good that you continue eating turds just hoping for that next chocolate bar.",6

"my grandfather smoked his whole life. i was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, if you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.. tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. he gave it up immediately. three years later he died of lung cancer. it was really sad and destroyed me. my mother said to me- dont ever smoke. please dont put your family through what your grandfather put us through. i agreed. at 28, i have never touched a cigarette. i must say, i feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.",2

"o.k ive nearly played 800hrs of this sh*t game, dont get it...but when you win its its great :d if you dont mind the stress and heart problems this game comes bundled with and that it destroys friendships by all means download dota 2, that being said the stratergy and teamwork you need to preform flawless kills and team ganks on the enemy team is not easy but when done correctly and played as a team this game is truly a gem you will never find a game like this that gives you the satisfaction that the choices you make can change the game in a matter of seconds. p.s- the game does have a tutorial to get you going but if your new to the moba scene take the time to learn, watch guides becuase this game has quite a steep learning curve and quite a big selection of items to buy (it can be overwhelming to the new player), i recommend playing a few bot games before jumping into a match against other players.",3

"originally a warcraft 3 mod, this highly influential arena style game has inspired many spin offs including the acclaimed league of legends. unlike league of legends however, you can control all 112 heroes when you buy the game, and there is no pay to win features at all; all bonus items are purely cosmetic and for fun. the community can even create content that can be acquired in game! the only shortcoming to dota is that it will be a little more difficult to pick up compared to league of legends. given the chance however, dota2 will prove to be a much more balanced and skill-oriented experience, with meaningful item and ability selection and a more dynamic gold farming game which both provide superior short and long term strategic gameplay. try the one that started it all, you wont be disappointed!",1

"very well designed game. great maps, community, heroes, items, and more. if youre new to mobas, put at least 100 hours in before you give this game any kind of bad review. the learning curve is more like a learning cliff, its very difficult to be good at this game.",4

"pros: requires strategy obviously needs teamwork to win makes you think for others rather than yourself awesome hero customizations and skins easy ui and hotkeys for your convenience requires technique and precision of skill execution (unlike similar games) cons: not for the greedy player lacks old and new heroes from dota soloists will have a hard time playing around the map gives you the habit of overspending because of awesome items public pairings are very random, you either pair up with noobs or quitters or maybe dendi or singsing themselves. overall, its a great game. a chip o the old block from dota 1(duhhh) they need to add more awesome items and customization for heroes. same goes with the selection; no frost wyvern, arc warden, and other upcoming heroes who-knows icefrog and the others will put.",5
"really fun game, need to play with friends, nice graphics and active staff",3
"an awesome game. and im into racing and cars. a bit of a learning curve, but highly rewarding once you get into even the average skilled matches. i suggest to read guides and practice last hitting and denying for a while in passive difficulty in a custom game. you cant get too good at last hitting.",2

"dota 2 destroyer of friendships, devourer of wallet contents, harvester of hatred, decimator of sanity, breeding ground of stupidity and keen depressant. 10/10",4
"the game is free so yeah, what can you lose? it can be fun to play but it can be horrible sometimes. and yea that depends on a lot of things. communication is the key and if u play casually you will find out that in most games no one speaks in your team. just pinging and commands. or they start speaking in some foreign language ( blyet) and that will not help at all. in the ranked games its a little bit better. the learning phase can be long but if you have some experiences with other mobas it wont be that tough. basically the game itself has no problems if you ask me. the problem is with the community of the game.",6

"dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. but once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. the fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. may the best team win.",10

(no preference on either game, i think bot of them are good) give this game a try, the learning curve is very steep but it is rewarding when you learn. i think this is the best gave valve has ever developed and has been the most played game on steam ever since the second year of beta development. try it out, its free and badass!",8

"if youre looking for a reason to commit time to dota 2  if youre actually reading this review for advice and a critical opinion, rather than to see what score im going to give the most popular game on steam  then, first up, thanks for being here. second, i want you to consider what it means when two grown men accidentally lather each other in regenerative goop. its gamings equivalent of holding a door open for somebody who is already reaching to hold the door open for you: a synchronicity of kindness that speaks to a deeper shared understanding of the situation both people are in. dota is a game where you can say the words are you thinking what im thinking? and be reliably assured that the person on the other end of your voip connection actually is. it might have the systems and bearing of a videogame, but dota shares the social impetus of a sport. its single environment isnt a map, its a pitch.",3

"the game is easy. all you do is load up and select which server you want to play on, brazil or russia. warning this game makes you incredibly racist against any person who has any connection whatsoever to russia, the phillipines, or brazil. other than that its a great way to ruin your life forever. but once you start playing you wont care anymore. 10/10 would play again.",4

"a rts game which play by 10 players,divided by 2 teams ( radiant and dire) this game is so excited because of there are so many heroes which their skills are so variants,such as stun,kill,healing,disabling and so on. dota is the game like chess and soccer, because you must use strategy to defeat your enemy,not just kill,looking for gold. for amateurs this game can use build help if the amateurs dont know what item must they build. remember,in this game you must be patient and cooperative when your teammates doing some fault because in this game there are winner and losser,the way you prove that you are pro is by cover up your teammates. i very reccomend this game not only just a guy can play this game,also a girl like me can also play too. end of my talk, i love dota2",4

"i entered the world of moba games through hon (heroes of newerth) which is basically a copy of dota (same type of heroes, about same skills, few different kind of heroes, etc..). i played it about 2 years and got bored of it. then when dota 2 were beta (could you even call it beta? valve were just too lazy to release it...) i requested invite into the game and got my key, though i basically never played it. then when suddenly most of my friends also started to play it, i too ended up to play it too. so what dota 2 is? lots of thinking and tactics, different kind of builds, russian players in wrong servers and more russians. but hey, now its f2p so you dont loose anything, worth at least test!",2
"this game has both made and destroyed my social life.",3
"the best moba of all time. the history behind this game is, well, insane. icefrog, the mysterious legend. league of legends sprouting basically from the first version. the teams in the esports scene. dota 2 lounge, for commited betters of esports dota 2 teams. trading cards. enjoying the hours upon hours spent with friends met just dominating every match that you can. the thrill of playing new heroes and somehow feeling as if the same map is always filled with new challenges. this is a game that you just cant debate about. this is probably the best game i have played besides counter strike. another winner for valve.",9

"though i havent played much of this game, i would recommend it to anyone who like moba titles. this game seems very confusing at first but gets easier with experience, not to say people whove played the game since release arent the best players, its all strategy based, anything could happen in the middle of the game you seem to be winning suddenly turns into you getting your  kicked. enjoy! p.s. this game does come at a cost, your social life.",1

"simply my favorite game. so far 425 hours spent playing. so many toons. there are builds. nice community. many different interchangeble looks for toons. but after all that, still f2p. it looks simply amazing. they have events for the holidays. new items come out all the time. items from the community get added into the game! i love it. there are some skilled people out there who get to have the satisfaction of having their item in the game. they support the community every day. the abandonment system gets people for leaving games. sometimes it is a little out of hand, (now it says play low-priority game when you accept match, lol). but my faviorite game. and people who compare this with lol, try it before you do. so much better.",2

"imo, if youre thinking about league or dota, dota. ill give the score, but beneath that will be reasons dotas better than the next moba youll try to pick up. dota2-9/10 pros: -every hero is free, so no real money needed. (except skins) no real money to buy that good champ you want -good community -much more rewarding for a skilled player. its not that other mobas are *easy* but more towards the idea of them taking less focus. -better graphics and particles (imo, because some can reason that their bad) -voice chat, allowing skilled party members to quickly say what they need to say rather than typing -very balanced. everything is weak against something else. cons: -laggy, at times. -occasionaly youll find a toxic player. (very rude) -much harder to git gud at, due to high experience needed. - oh yeah, and some people stay on the wrong server, despite being spanish, brazillian, russian",2

"its fun, after you get used to it. it hurts at the start but it gets better the deeper you go in. dota 2 is basically anal. there are alot of servers availible which include:russia, and other servers that are filled with russians. you will experience noobs sometimes, such as the infamous pudge jungle. but its fiiine, lycan didnt need the jungle anyways am i right? tldr: a dont be lazy, read the damn thing.",7

"what can i say about dota 2 that hasnt been said before, it is one of the most mechanically complex games you could possibly find around. it has a extremely high skill ceiling and takes a lot of effort from you to learn and not be a burden on your team. you will get hate from the community until you become capable and if you do decide to dive in prepare yourself for some harsh words until you settle in but compering this game to league of legends like most others do, it is more complex and fulfilling then league will ever be but its not for the faint of heart. but if you do stick with it and a few mates it will be hands down one of the best times you could ever have.",5

"easy and fun game, invite your friends to experience the thrill of dota with good graphics.",2
"very good remake of the original dota warcraft iii for the orignal dota lovers it is the rebirth of the saga. if you are a lol player your deffently familiar with the moba play style but you will have a harder time getting used to this because this game is alot harder and is alot more punishing for playing bad. one bad teamfight can bring the entier game down. i recommend teaming up with couple of friends and go together trough the learning rollercoaster curve",7
"current meta sucks, next meta will probably suck just as well. this game is better off you recognizing every aspect of the game and getting used to the learning curve, play 600-2000 hours, get mad at it, and fanboy over professional teams. fanboying and following professional teams and tournaments is the best way to go. also the lore isnt half bad. tl;dr this game is better than league of ies",1

"best game in that world but you have to learn one thing its russian language and be prepared to play with alot of russian noobs but what the hell its a very fun to play game",1
"this is one of the most popular games of all time because this is not just a game. friendship, e-sport, respect, motivation, life, teamwork, skill, experience, responsibility, cultures and so many other can be found in this three lanes battle of 10 heroes. in dota 2 everything is in balance. dota 2 is free to play and you dont need money to buy heroes. there is a lot of customizations but they have no effect in game. you cannot pay to win. so, you may ask what does a hero truly need to get the victory... that is for you to decide. i have been playing dota since 2008. but i am not a pro, i am just a fan. thank you icefrog you are amazing. and thank you gabe.",8
"this game gives me so much fun..........its a awesome game",10

"dota 2 has got to be the best thing ive played since i was born. not only are the movement and combat more stable than bruce lee glued to a weeble wobble, but ive accumilated over 30 hours and have not seen a single hacker. if i could sum it up i would say its like chess, rock paper scisors, and torchlight 2 thrown into a blender to make the perfect moba. playing this game lost me hours of my life that ill never get back, and i dont want them back. gold medals and cigars to valve once again.",4
"got kicked out of college because of this game. 10/10. would do again.",4
"for those who have played a moba game, i recommend dota 2. however its not fully perfect yet. language wise it is a mess. even if you pick english as your choice. you will get games with russians, brazilians, mexicans, and etc from time to time and there is really nothing you can do about until it is fixed. game play wise its a bit slower pace then heroes of newerth, but much faster then league of legends and equally as competitive.",8
"i liked this game because of the stunning graphics but i dont like is some of the other players is useless or noob :(",2
"yeah, this is an awesome game! you probably wont get it at first, but you will. itll just get more fun over time. i do recommend this game! :d",6
"this game is best for people. skill still same even we wear good costum. :d",4
"mostly everything is good except for the matchmaking system. it is quite broken. valve need more effort to revamp matchmaking system to ensure everyone has a more decent and more enjoyable gaming experience in dota 2. overall rating is 8/10.",1
"this is a good game, however i dont like the concept of being paired with noobs. it totally ruins the game, you play with people that is not in the same skill level and you tend to lose more than to win most of your games. you should change the way how your system finds a match for an individual it should be people who win will be paired with people who win, and those who lose alot play amongst themselves. i cant believe that when you go solo match there are people who are in a party? whats that about? i believe that you can never learn common sense, you are born with that talent. you should hire developers that have common sense if you want this game of yours appreciated by dota2 and non dota2 players. most likely if non dota2 players find the enviroment in that kind of manner i believe that this game will be undisputedly number 1 in rtsgaming",5
"great competitive game to play with your friends. promotes strategy, team work and is very fun to play",8

"can be lots of fun... or as equally frustrating. lots of time to play this game, as it builds over the length of time you invest into it. it all depends on how good your team plays together and how bad the other team does the same. no matter how good you are or your team... there could be just the perfect group of characters and teamwork on the other team and they just stomp you. or other maps where your whole team randoms their characters... and you win without really trying. argh. but i am still drawn towards this game like a moth to the flame. much to the moths demise. and mine.",2

"pros: - huge variety of heroes (more heroes are being added) - all heroes are unlocked from the start - friendly community - doesnt need a huge or expensive graphics card, thus any person with a good/decent rig can play the game - can be played offline by playing with bots or using lan - game is free to play - continuous updates for the game are being done - well improved graphics than dota 1 - doesnt get boring or repetitive due to the diverse amount of heroes and the time it takes to perfect every hero. - perfects everything that was done in dota 1 cons: - game is addictive - a decent internet speed is required due to constant updates and to play the game without any lags. - time consuming (an average match takes about 40-35 minutes) verdict: 9.5/10",2
"u have been spooked by the    spooky skilenton    send this to 7 ppl or skelintons will eat you",1
"cool game although the higher your level the lower drop rates for items would be.the graphics are really good and beautiful..i must say this game is far more better than league of legends as most of the heroes in there is imbalanced..i mean mostly every hero in that game can 1shot you..and also league of legends doesnt have any trading systems and its graphics really sucks...recently i traded with someone..it went well at first but when we were gonna trade..he cancelled it and as result ive been scammed,but its not a problem the item is only worth 0.01usd. better luck next time for scammers like him!thats all..good luck to the devs! :d",3

"got obsessed with dota to the point where my girlfriend broke up with me. 1000/10",5
"with so many mobas out there. which one is the best? well i cant answer that question for you, but i can tell you how great this game is. first off, this game has a steep learning curve, so if you prefer mindless action games, then this isnt for you. once you get past the learning curve however, thats when things start to get really fun. dive in to this action packed game as you battle other people across 3 lanes in a team based enviroment. there is literally next to no grinding in this game, everyone starts at level 1 in each game, so the only real question is, how far are you willing to go to become the best? watch other people play with in the in-built game viewer, and study a libary of heroes as you progressively become better. dont worry about people calling you a noob when you first play, because they were also noobs once! just ignore them and enjoy the rest of the game.",1
"i wanted to review south park stick of truth but i dont bought it so i came here. south park steak of truth starts off funny but quickly loses its charm after they start swearing very uncool for a kids game to do i mean you dont see other mmorpgs like team fortress swearing so i am gonna have to give this one a big phat thumbs down.",1

"this game is loads of fun. easy tutorial for beginners :)!",7
"incredibly addicting. the gameplay itself is fun and engaging. it is played with a team of 5 characters with unique sets of skills and abilities versus another group. it is definitely a team effort to win the game. a single match would take about 40 to 60 minutes. customization of some aspects of the game adds another spice to the in-game play. characters costume sets, items, screensvers and skins and other dlcs which can be bought or traded at the steam market would keep the avid player own the characters. over all the game is exciting and fun. i give it 10 out of 10.",2
"i thank this game for allowing me to learn fluent russian in a matter of hours!",1
"it is ing boring. slow gameplay which i was tired of after 2hrs of tutorials, a stupid inventory system, microtransactions are always rubbed in your face and, at least in tutorials storylines i could have written in the 2nd grade. and then the artstyle! stolen from... wait, oh right! every second game on the market. added to that is the permanent download, as the game just keeps getiing bigger and bigger and more overfilled with  you have to pay for. it is boring and just a cash grab. go play something else, there are good f2p games out there. it took a lot of my time to download and is wasting 10gb of hard drive space.",1

"do you play lol? do you play hon? do you play any type of moba that is not dota 2? how about you grow some nuts and play a real mans game. stop playing  imitations and play the real deal, seoritas.",2
"great competitve game better moba then most and its fun and easy to enjoy",3
"this game is upgraded game from warcraft iii which i love <3 dota 2 is more understandable for rookie, this game is giving you instructions for what weapon is equipable for what hero. and this game is amazing easpacially when the war. and iit give you toturial (y)",1
"the basketball equivalent of esports, with a company behind it that owns the dominating distribution platform for video games. the same company which happened to snag up the original creator of dota, and granting him a golden shower of two dollar bills. what could go wrong? the tutorial is an embrassasment at worse, and at best a testament to the fact that its hard to get in to this game. frankly given the sh*t tutorial, mindset of your average player (including players frequently triggering teammates to spite them) and the learning cliff of this game, im amazed this game isnt exculsively played by a tiny majority of unhinged players.",5
"im not a huge fan of mobas, but i do enjoy league of legends very much and ive played smite when it first came out. like most mobas, the community can be cruel and insane at times, torching you for the simplest mistakes. neat and interesting abilities that can be even complicated the first time you use them, this game has a lot of replay, giving you the choice to play many many heroes. unless you like competition and a fierce community, stay away from dota and try lol or another moba, but you should still give it a try, play a bot game or two and feel the game. no pay 2 win as its a official steam game, and a very successful one. you can earn and buy costumes and cosmetics through playing the game and buying them with real money. if you feel up to it, you can also trade unwanted cosmetics for ones you want through the steam trading system. personal rating: 3.5/5",1
"i would certainly recommend this game! although it has a high learning curve because of the many item and hero builds, it is a very team-oriented game where communication and coordination matters the most. be warned though, it is a very addictive game and you will sink many hours into it!",5
"if dota 2 was a potato.. it would be a good potato",4
"what a great game! 10/10, amazingly satisfying and fun all round.",7
"an epic game , just need some edit , and it will be perfect !",2
"one of the best esport games in history. a lot of people have problems with its steep learning curve. itll be hard for really long time to compete with veterans but its an esport game so thats what you should expect from games of this type. also prepare for flaming from russians. they think everyone know their language so they select all servers to communicate with wider range of people.",2

"it is better to have every level item drop coz its level is now useless",2
"just amazing game,i have been playing this game like 4 n half years now...1st dota 1 then this,never gets boring..... kinda addictive game....but u will have real fun playing this game.idk bout lol but this is just amazing n most skillfull game. doesnt matter if u r new in dota family,game provides all basic lessons in-game. but u still need 2 control your hunger after playing this game..kinda destroys your important hours of your life as well if u got no self control.",3

"this is the worst game i have ever played in my entire life, the most depressing and anxiety inducing game ever. its an addiction you cant stop, a drug you cant refuse. every thought you have is about the game...the lanes, the heroes, the creeps, the items. if you play this game, you fall into a deep dark pit you will never climb out of.",2

"i just wanted to try the game out, and i couldnt run it well. so i go to delete it from my library when i realize that i cant. i give this game a thumbs down because it is literally poison to my eyes every time i see it in my library. all you people who suggest hiding it in another folder, shut up. i will just have a crappy folder as an eyesore instead. screw you dota 2 and dota 2 test, get out of my ing library!",1
"this game is fun and entertaining if you actule have teammates to play with.... do not play this game solo you will get crushed by partys from opposing team who know how to make combinations with heros... but that is not the worst part of this game, the worst part is the fact that you will most likely get teamed up with russain players or spanish who are uncapable of speaking english language at all. i have spent two years in this game trying to find one or two good teammates, but all i found in this game is non english speaking teammates who keep kill stealing and blameing others for their own mistake. this game is no fun for me, its real pain filled with anger and haitred....",5

"the moba equivalent of getting kicked in the , repeatedly, for hours on end, until little remains of what could resemble genitalia. however, the truly astonishing part, is that this wasnt torture, but done through your own volition; you wanted to made miserable. hell, you probably paid for it a little. every game brings such traumatic pain and anguish, this game should be considered a war crime. psychologists have analyzed why dota players put themselves through this kind of hell, and all tests have come up inconclusive. this game has caused the perpetual virginity of thousands of people. friendships have been ruined, careers lost, and marriages have ended, all because of this game. dear god, get rid off this awful blight on humanity. only the dead can know peace from this evil... 10/10 i recommend this game to all my friends!",2
"play a few more games with me and my friends and if u still dont like it then ok",2
"can be brutal for new people to mobas (this was my first moba), the game has a steep learning curve. id recommend actually watching some videos of gameplay first so you have a basic understanding of the game. if you can get through your first 20 - 30 games without smashing your pc than youll probably be addicted, but thats a bit if. id personally recommend that everyone try the game but can safely say that not everyone will like it.",5

"addicting game, i learned a lot about myself and my family playing it. its funny how small the world is, everyone know my mom and some people even had relationships with her! i hope it was before my father married them. anyway, that does not matter anymore, after i found out i was gay ( to be precise), my father kicked me out of the house. its ok, apparently i was adopted when i was younger so i will take this time to move to russia and find my family. hope to play again when i get back, who knows what else can i learn!",6

"one thing i like about this game is that it can relieve your stress. i will definitely recommend it to others.",5
"a 6 or 7 line review just wont do this game justice. dota 2s learning curve is pretty steep but once you learn the basics, which can take 5 to 15 matches, its rewarding experience thats all about teamwork and playing your role correctly. dota 2s social features are cutting edge and designed for great casual, hardcore and competitive play. the controls are tight and responsive while dedicated servers on multiple locations allow for almost no noticeable latency. its free to play but people wont use their wallets for tactical advantage because all items are purely cosmetic. really impressive game and my personal game of the year 2013.",4
"this moba game is awesome.. allows users to make their own ideas and make profit from them..",2
"really outstanding game. definitely give it a try sometime. outstanding how they managed to make such a big and difficult game `easy`, try to dont get confused and fight through it. worth the time, practice by playing with friends, watching games on youtube(i really like purgegamers) or just watch a random pub. all of that is really instructive and helps you become a better player. ps: playing the tutorial really helps.",1

"this is by far one of the worst rpgs or whatever the hell type of game this is, its overrated, hard to learn, the players are always aresholes, it feels lazly and halfed  put together. if you enjoy being a sane happy person dont play this game!",1

"while its a fun game its a bit too tedious for me.",1
"this is very high quality game. graphics are very detailed and good. but still, you can play on low quality and enjoy. the thing about this game is, that while starting , you wait too much time : match searching and player waiting. players often fail to connect. second thing, if you like rpg games, the fact that someone can be first and take the hero that you like, want will be terrible. and to be short, if you dont have enough free time to spend (40 min-1hour) on match, dont start it, if you leave , you wll recieve abandon and ruin your teams game (butin reality no one knows is it ruining or helping , couse in late game, money is everything and your money will be spreaded between your teammates). so yea you should try this game if you like competition and sometimes rage :)",1

"want to play a nice, simple game? one with a friendly community? maybe some balance? well, too bad, because this is dota.",5
"the game can be played at any skill level but the beauty is that at higher levels there is so much depth that no two games are ever alike. the only issue is that it is difficult to improve without having someone (friendly) better than you who will actively call out your mistakes; in dota 2, ignorance is not bliss.",2

"i started playing this game awhile ago, thinking it was a little fun game i could play from time to time. turns out when you download dota you agree to sell your soul to satan and in exchange you get people who dont speak english on us servers, supports that either feed or dont support, and the worst of all, you have people that are actually good at the game (scary, right?). of course i have friends to play this new game with. i hate all of them. ill probably never get a job and will die of starvation because i play dota 420/69 or in simpler terms 9/11 -me",3

"sequel for dota .. great gameplay .. steep learning curve .. best game ever",5
"dota 2 is very much better than legend of league in many ways. it was able to host tournament, associated with steam, friends, etc. its just that its an unique game or even more special. it give me more efforts to continue playing because its too fun. able to practice with bots for private even able to invite your friends to practice with bots. have a team to create like guild or clan. have different rules for the game or to create game. always meet different players with different personality that might be interesting to know what different human made of. build teamwork, communicate, and stuff like that. oh and it have so many characters to use and it have different items for character like skins or others. background changes. hud skins. everything it have. ever if you need something, its always there (; play dota 2!",4

"dota 2 is a game ive been playing for about a year or so now, and i dont think ive ever been so addicted to a game before. its a game with teamwork, strategy and beautiful visuals. the hero pool has a huge variety of different looks, skills and basic stats. the game modes for the online mode are also cool, but i wish some people who play captains mode will actually listen to their teammates instead of just picking wherever they want to. overall this game is really fun to play and its free! i would definately recommend this game to people who have a semi-long attention span and a quick reaction time.",2
"great game hard to play.....if you have no idea from dota or any other moba games dont even bother to play you will be noob for 2 years at least you are going to feed enemys and everyone will hate you just dont play it....but if you are learning fast find someone who knows how to play and plz him to teach you you will be able to play without feeding in half a year and if you are that good in learning things you can go watch pro streams and games so you can be better generally and not just a feeding boy",10
"as a drop while playing dota 2. because dota 2 is a free-to-play game, players do not receive free cards like most other games. instead, a card drop becomes available for roughly every $9 usd spent on cosmetic items in the dota 2 store. if you have card drops available, they will appear automatically in your steam inventory as long as your dota 2 client is open. cards drop approximately once every 15-60 minutes. from the steam community market. by trading with another player. from a booster pack. booster packs are packets of several cards that drop randomly after you have forged one dota 2 badge. booster packs can also be bought on the market. booster packs drop more frequently for players with higher steam levels.",5

"really, truly an amazing game. after putting so much time in this game i have realised that i finally had lost faith in the human race and decided to rip my balls off. its a great game to learn foreign languages and such but not much else. unless you are a tryhard i would not suggest this game as the community is rude as hell. its pretty addictive as any other moba but by far not the best ive played. even if the community is less racist then hon and more mature then the community of lol, its pretty bad. the only way i am ever playing this game is with a group of friends.",2

"i really like this game! no matter how long u play it, ull never get bored!",3
"dota (defense of the ancients ) is a action rts game, a great esports platform, a fun game to play if you just know the mechanics of this great game. 10 random players choose from a strong hero pool with different powers and the players have to cooperate with each other understand the extremities of the game. leadership,forgivness,sacrifice and great strategy is required for the win or you end up losing and wasting an hour or two. the only drawback is a steep learning curve but when finally you learn this game you will just love this and play all day. it is also a great way to connect with players of the world a large community supports this, so a word of advice play hard die hard go pro.",4

"kindly of.. mixed emotion.. sometimes is really funny and exciting, but sometimes its really sucks",4
"+ free-to-play, and not pay-to-win! + great graphics + addictive gameplay + has 100+ heroes that can be played + supported & featured by esports + can actually grant you big money if played competitively - the community sucks real bad - hard to learn, hard to master (at least for me anyways)",2
"10/10 recommended, its a game where you meet infamous thai girl(?) noozkii, a female womanizer, and a male catfisher with names like miyako. oh, you will also encounter people who sound like a great leader and stream their game in twitch. lastly, what you will always see in this game is harvest moon legend, who farms potatoes for the entire game.",5
"best dota remake ever, and the best moba to date ! for hardcore players!!! if you like light, slow paced moba i suggest playing lol",6
"its a good game , where i can relax after school :d",5

"i sometimes think back to better times when i played games that werent dota2. when i knew no words of russian or infact held a hatred of people who didnt speak my language. i quickly repress those thoughts by diving back into euw and being greeted by  every time. home is where the hate is.",7
"dota 2 is one of those games that never get old. i have endless hours of time. its is a game of skill and i enjoy the entire aspect. i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a game to spend constant hours in.",3
"like almost any other moba out there, its free unless you want any of your looks customized. i only played a handful of matches, and being at least semi-literate in both moba uis and old custom warcraft and starcraft maps, i can in no way recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore of moba fans. the ui is unintuitive, the shop is a mess to look at if youre new, and you will likely get your face smashed in by even the computer-controlled players time and time again while you punishingly learn every little thing it takes to be good at this game. if you have never played a moba, if you dont have a friend who already plays this and can walk you through what to do, do not try this game. if you really love mobas and are looking for a new one, yes, definitely try this and i hope you enjoy it. i did not, not even remotely.",1
"wow these other top reviews lol. you will play against or with people who dont speak english but for the most part they are ok, minus the yelling in the mic. this may be the single most addictive game ive ever played and i just think that if you dont at least try it for a few rounds youre missing out. easily the best free game available on steam and by far the most complex. easy to learn hard to master anyone? just focus on last hitting creeps and you will be fine. :)",5
"will take over your life....or take over dota, your choice",3
"really2 nice game. im so having fun play this game",3
"the best online gaming ever.. epic.. thanks icefrog for giving us to play this moba.",3
"dota 2 is a great game. i love it but its not for everyone. dont take this the wrong way because its awesome but you shouldnt play this if you dont want to get screamed at or scream yourself. everyone in dota thinks that they know best and some times they do but if you screw up just once (because once is all it takes to loose in dota) they will tear you a new one before you can apologize. repentence for this treatment you are given a great moba which is sooooo much better than lol. you actually have to work as a team and everyone matters. the game is won and lost by your very actions. its great and competitive and super fun. it looks nice and runs nice, it just takes some practice to get good at. once you are good or atleast reasonable you can just sit back and enjoy (im not saying you wont rage at noobs or your own mistakes). 15/15 acing it everyday. thats dota 2!",1
"yes its nice and fun to play... amazing graphics :-d",1

"dota 2 is a moba (multiplayer online battle arena) game from valve, in which you control one hero in an online 5vs5 game. dota had its beginning in the beloved game warcraft3 as a modificated map. dota 2 is hard to understand, especially at the beginning u have much to learn. but when you play a few matches and you start understanding the heroes and game mechanics, you will fall in love with this game. its also free to play, so just try it. :)",5
"a game that deserves the greatness that it has reached.",10
"the game can be played at any skill level but the beauty is that at higher levels there is so much depth that no two games are ever alike. the only issue is that it is difficult to improve without having someone (friendly) better than you who will actively call out your mistakes; in dota 2, ignorance is not bliss.",2
"the best moba hands down. the lore of the heroes, the diversity and unique design of each hero, every aspect is well thought out. while some heroes are a bit overpowered, you can still counter them, and you can still win. the setting and soundtrack adds to the aspect of gameplay as well. this game crushes lol, smite, and hon in my opinion.",2
"every game is different, every game is fun. must play for all moba fans.",3
"i recommend this game for those who wants to a another ultimate gaming experience..",3
"addicting, and fun. but when i set my preferences, as english. i dont want to have a full team of russians. also when i level up, please dont give me rubbish common items, for morphling. thanks <3",3
"dota 2 consists the most unblanaced heros for any game on the market as of right now! there so many over powered abilities on too many heros. in fact, the heros are considered over powered are played every single, of every single match. dota 2 is the worst game, i have ever played due to the lack community(which is toxic), hero abilities which are over powered, and all around broken game. if you like your sanity, do not play this game. if you do not want to become racist, do not play this, if you dont rich pumping  tons of money into professional gaming just so the game can make a buck or two, do not play game. if you do not like russia, do not play this game. if you do not like any hispanic, do no play this game. basically, what saying to you, if you want to play a moba, go play league of legends.",6
"i recommend this game :d cuase you need team work :)",1
"best free to play game on the market. challenges players with the bazillion characters but once you figure it out dota is a great game.",3
"when i started playing, i noticed there is a lot of russians... bit by bit those monsters started to  my brains. after a while  got used to . they started calling me   . i think  . then i started to    . now   . i        .. please  ..",3
"i only play this game on steam. all other game, i pirate it. :)",4
"pluses: + a lot of kinds of heroes + very interesting game, if your teammates and enemies are normal people minuses: - there is only 1 map - players with abusive nicknames (often russian,turkish and a few american players nicknames) - i like demigod more than dota 2. because, this game type used by demigod at first time. - there are not achievements! reason: everyone speak about this game and i bored and tried this game.",3
"great game, really one of the best mobas ive played in my life. it can be hard and really challenging sometimes, yes it cant be fair during most games but if you get the hang of it, youll surely enjoy it.",1

"its really great game it makes u happy and feel energy in bad times and boring times and there something incredible can do in the game so play it its really fun :)",4
"800+ hours and i still suck 10/10 would rage again",4
"personally, i really enjoy playing this game for the most part. aside from the constant foreign rage and everyone blaming each other for mistakes, this is a really fun team game. sure, it takes a long time to figure out what each hero does and what counters what, but once you get to that point it becomes a fantastic game to play with friends. it really shows how well you can adapt to certain situations or communicate with your team to be effective and win the game.",5
"a shoddily made pay-to-win event available only in short period of time, if you can get into it. when that timer hits 0 youd better hope the dota 2 network doesnt go down or youll miss it on the fun of people with more disposable income deathballing down your lane.",8
"this game is simply terrible the level of idiots is remarkable and if you like the idea like the first dota simple download league of legends from riot games it is also free but u can report cheaters/noobs/etc. bec. they update unimaginably frequently that every month they bring a new hero 2/10",1

"looking to cut yourself off from the real world? life getting too boring for you? or are you just simply finding for a way to throw your dull life away? look no further, this game is the game for you. this game promises you hours of fun on end. you fight in a team to claim victory over the enemy teams ancient, hence the title defence of the ancients. some heroes are easily grasped, making it easy for beginners to learn the basics. once you start getting the hang of things and master the basics, there are a hundred other heroes to learn and master. personally, this game has ruined my life. with about 400 hours of gameplay, my grades have dropped, i have no time to hang out with friends anymore, my family hates me because im always in my room, you name it, im probably there right now. but ive never been happier in my life. girlfriend? sorry, i dont know what that is.",3

"i think theres a bug or an error about the dropping of items. and it seems like not accurate information about the longer you play the more chances of getting an item. try to fix it. and also, the players that we are reporting, are you taking of action with that? because many players are annoying, they ruin the game of others. thank you for the authority to recommend. :d",3
"well for starters, take a look at my total hours played. that should tell you how much i like this game. i honestly find the idea of a moba very appealing. although there might be other games out there in the genre that (dare i say it) are better than dota 2, i still find dota 2 to be the one game i always go back too. the game mechanics are solid, the character balancing is always changing, adding new depths to the gameplay, and many of the players in dota are relatively laid back. is dota 2 the best game in the world? probably not. is dota 2 the game i have spent 1000+ hours on and will probably spend another thousand on? absolutely.",7

"i entirely reccomend dota2 it is a game you can sink so much time into and not get bored.",2
"i had good grades until i started playing dota, now im failing maths... 11/10 would buy again",5
"dota 2 is an alright game, ive only roughly played around 600+ hours and somewhat enjoyed it. the games community is ing horrible and ive never witnessed so much trash talking in my life. the game has a good structure and a good setting, it was confusing at the start but i use to it.",3
"i only stopped playing because i wanted my life back.",4
"totes recommend this moba fans. amazing. spent so many hours.",2
"great game! the learning curve is however very steep, and you will probably end up losing a lot of your first games (as you get flamed by your teammates). but as you get better, youll quite enjoy it. by far the best moba experience you can have.",6
"hallo. happy playing in dota2 this game is good (y)",5
"eu west server is not the russian server! its not even difficult to toggle it correctly and lower your ping, damn russians",2
"this is the game in which youll be criticized for sucking, regardless of performance. this is the game in which youll learn to hate the russians. this is the game that sucks your social life away more than world of warcraft. and so many other things. definetly recommend it. for it. is. good.",2

"if you are new to pc gaming or rts/moba games, dota 2 will appear as impenetrable as a wall. the learning curve for this game is by far the worst element of mobas. however, those of you with some experience with rts games or are willing to learn will find the teamplay experience of dota 2 an enjoyable. would recommend to anyone with a competent pc and drive to play competitively.",5

"expect no less from this game, you will find that this game extremely fun.",10
"an interesting proposition. unlike most games, this is the gift that keeps on giving. over the lifetime of dota 2 many additions have been made, and many continue to come along. dota 2 is based on an old warcraft mod, and on a weekly and monthly basis, valve continues to update and add features to the game. aside from being a lucrative scene for competitive gamers, it also has a steep learning curve and endless combinations as far as team compisitons go. if you arent the kind of person who likes to play versus other players, the game allows you to play cooperatively against bots. and to further add to the lifespan of the game, the developers release festive events every 3-5 months to add something extra for players to do. as the game is free to play, this game can potentially net you some gains in the form of the marketable items you recieve for playing.",3

"oh my god guys . best game ever . better play this  :))))",1
"start playing today, a game were you spend most of your time saying, what the ing hell? but thats not all, start from now on to understand what real racism means, not only will you hate the russians, but soon youll hate yourself too? why? because when you play it, youll realise. oh you think thats it? no there is more. this game will not only make you hate everyone else in the world, but it will also make you - anti social - actually racist - rage (more often) - be a gigantic  fag. in other words, this game is f**king awesome. but thats not all just to dota, because in the end, it all concludes to one point. welcome to dota, now gtfo.",4
"i think its really fun, since it requires strategy and mind. teamwork is possible, and sometimes people are really nice even if youre new to the game. i like it overall, since it doesnt really matter about one person all the time, but everyones co-operation. i also loved the gameplay, as if im playing warcraft or something. so if you like strategy and teamwork, i think ill recommend it.",1

"i recommend this game in case you want to lose the will to live.",7
"great game, free to play, have a good time with ya mates and meet all kinds of people lol what more could ya ask for.",3
"great game with a variety of characters to choose from. from abaddon to zues this game does not stop. you might think that this game is a waste of time, but from a guy who played this game for over 100 hours, its worth it. this strategy game is spectacular and giant improvement from dota. valve outdid themselves.",1
"great game. has a learning curve, but with time dota 2 will outshine other similar games. able to pick all heroes from the start. pay for cosmetics that dont have any effect on skill/ability.",5

"its a nice game, its free to play and it gives you the ability to spend all your free hours for the next 6 months at least. if you ever played this type of game that is. it has good graphics and nice mechanics. a few drawbacks are : 1. its sort of hard to learn. 2. some heroes are a bit unbalanced and for you people in western europe 3. eu west server is like russia 2 >_< i do like the game overall though and i can keep on playing it for a while",5
"hey its fun! coming from the guy who never played a moba before. watch out for the community though, theyll gut you alive. out of love.",3
"dota 2 is possibly one of the best game valve has made based on the original dota mod from warcraft iii: frozen throne. many balance changes, including item drops, events, and even cool stuff to collect. you know your heroes well, use them to keep the distinction against your foes and bring their ancient down, either raidiant or dire. i like to play this again and now i do it. i reccommend this to anyone who played dota before or any rts/rpg player who wants to take the challenge. 10/10 from neil, almost 3 years steam veteran",1
"after 2000 hours with the game i realized how much of a time waster this  is, that added with valve being a piece of  of a company... i dont even have to tell the reasons (hint: reusing source engine which caused multiple bugs and made the game take 3 years to develop...  ground textures,  art style, 1 hero per year released, crappy language matchmaking, etc).",8
"do you have a nice family? do you have a job? do you have dreams? are you a student? if your answer to any of these question is yes do drugs but please dont dowload this game, it will consume you. you will dream with dota, you will feel dota and you will be dota. every time somebody calls, youll hear . every time something bad happens you will try to report the person responsible for it. this game is dangerous. this game is worst than any drug. 322/10",2
"great game it is much more challenging than any other moba i have played, and every character is unique. the voice acting is great, the gameplay is great, and even the world and sound effects are great. its free to!",8
"dota 2 is brought to us at a time when the dominating moba (league of legends) thrives and beats it in numbers of users etc. but dota 2 brings variety to the table as it is a very pretty game with different mechanics and gameplay, if you do play league of legends this is probably the next best thing and shouldnt be left in the shadow, when released the game will be played maybe not as much a league of legends but there is definatley a strong community which willl show on release. i am happy to be part of the beta as it refreshing to play but a can be hard to master!",1
"it makes me relax when playing this game. still i need to focus on things that is more important.",3
"over 300 hours logged into this moba. thats all the review you need",2
"if you want to play a game of the moba. i recommend this because it was the first game ive ever played for a long time. since i played, i like the skill balance of it. its not over too much like another game of the moba. it actually is original of those games.",5

"99% of players - 14 yo dumb fuqs 1% - divinely pleasant people. should play at least for them.",4
"this game really brings out your own imagination on how you think and react and what you want to do, limitless possibilities is one of the few things games have these days especially online gaming, i never was a big dota fan but after i got to play around a bit after being pushed in to it with friends i found out that it truly is something that attracts the mind, it is like a dopamine is released into the brain and you want to come back for more, the game and detail along with it being a free-to-play game really takes my fancy, i would recommend this game to any person who likes a challenge, someone who likes to explore his imagination and to be competitive to rise and see how good you can get at something, valve really outdone themselves on this one. good job guys.",1
"pretty fun and interesting if you play with the right people. some people are trashtalkers and rude but overall you can just kill them haha totally recommend you guys playing.",2

"literally, a bad game. 2/10. 4 years since first released? still beta, 2014. you selected english? better learn 3 new languages. team game? farm it out. updates? only to release more hats. new heroes? half-life 2 ep 3. metascore 90? money, cash. 18+? children only. free to play? average iq drops below 100. gave first blood? leave game. mmr? clearly balanced. suggest legitimate opinion that would result in a win? muted. play better than most? reported. reported the person that fed on purpose? have them on your team next game. low priority? for life. only game to get legitimate reviews. you think the reviews are a joking? play the game.",8
"great game from steam. totaly different from dota 1 and this creates a whole new arena of battle. thumbs up steam",6
"ohh dota... how im glad i found you. i come from almost 600 hours of league of legends. and even though i never think i will get over the hours ive put in to league.i deffinetly think that dota was a gem covered in dust for me. i always thought this game was league but just more complicated and difficult. and it was xd. i felt like i was never even gonna figure out how to play. and here we are 118 hours later. and i dont have any regrets. so if you like the m.o.b.a genre even if your a lol,smite or even strife person i really think you should give dota a try. 7/10",1

"one thing i like about this game is that it can relieve your stress. i will definitely recommend it to others.",5
"so much fun you can get addicted to it saw it before....",3
"i somehow have 27hrs clocked into this game. ive watched countless youtube videos showing how to play this game. thanks to my understanding of the various beginner/intermediate/pro level strategies/habits and a clear view of just how steep the learning curve is, ive essentially cowed myself into sticking with the training campaign for fear of being an anchor. i dont play anymore, but i love watching/critiquing videos. i just thought i should let you know that.",1

"just cant stop playing, this is th real  free to play game, not the kind of games that pay to win",1
"this game is really fun once you figured it out but the learning curve is thick unless you got wonderful team mates to teach you or a really good friend to coach you. overall i think everyone should give this game a tryout and learn to kick butt. all in all this game is worth it and more so since its free to play so dont fear about wasting money this game will become your addiction soon enough.",3

"this game make titans cry and babies grow facial hair. before you can properly assess this game, you must first climb the highest mountain while your consciousness is implanted into a robot at the bottom of the sea. the moment you realize the gold that this game achieves is the very same moment that you become one with the greater knowledge, so please wrap yourself in this higher power by becoming one with the dota 2.",6

"to start with if youre thinking of playing dota2 its going to be rough when you start and its probably best to start with some friends, but when you get past that barrier youll never find another game to fill that void of dota2s moba experience. would totally recommend this to anyone thinking of playing just beast through the beginners block and ignore the flamers :)",3

"for me it is like a daily routine to play and compete against players across the world. not just we share our views but also our intellects collide on the same battlefield to determine the wave of glory for teams playing each round. sometimes we win but we loose which really makes to see deep in our hearts where we need the fear to be controlled and our reflexes on time through the game any time any place. at last it made us a way better than we happen to be in our previous game. understanding and reasoning the events of game is the most key factor if u really need to make best out of your effort. this game really changed us more than just one way.",9

"so much scammers but when the game itself is talked about.. the game is fantastic..",4
"i wasnt sure how id like a game that is the same map every time you play it, but with over 100 different heros to choose from this game never gets old. 5v5 tower defense.....count me in!",5
"dont play it,it will take your life. 10/10 recommended",6
"quite possibly the best game i have played in the last 20 years of gaming. a true strategy game, which relies on teamwork more than who is the faster builder. truly brilliant. regular updates keep the game fresh, and who can argue about the cost for this game. this is a game which fits the saying, takes minutes to learn, but will take a lifetime to master.",2
"dota 2 is a fast-paced first person shooter with some rpg elements mixed in. in all my years of playing indie games, i have never seen a better real time strategy game. for a space travel simulator, its lacking in rocketships, but overall, it is one of the greatest zombie survival game on the market. if you could possibly desire a better game, then you should think about purchasing drake of the 99 dragons. both it and dota 2 share many similarites.",1
"great game i first started because my friend was playing and didnt know how to play but i got started and now i add people and teach them to play other then that great game i love it play it ever day i highly recommend it no real bad glitchs or any glitches really everone is friendly and nice...!!!!!",3

"the beta was fun... now? this game makes me want to slay the russian federation. end of story.",1
"fantastic game. much longer more intense games, better skill cap and actually requires teamwork and mana control. oh and you dont get shitlords that scrap their way to 6 build because you actually lose gold if you are bad. secondly, there arent runes so everyone is equal at the start and you dont get shafted by picking the wrong runes or not owning some, hereos are all free, items are cheaper and you can mix and match items from different sers as they go into slots and are cheaper. finally you dont get summoner spells so people if they get caught, die. they dont flash away and you cant just run up and hit a tower without creeps due to backdoor protection, so rat dota takes skills.",1
"the only game i never get bored of playing over and over again",5
"have you always wanted to learn another language but could never stick with it? if yes then vavle has the perfect product for you! learn spanish and russian in under a month for free!",2
"brilliant game, made even more amazing with your friends co-operation however, there is one bad side. although this game is shockingly awsome, there is a bad point to it. there are some items that are incredibly rare and un-attainable unless you are willing to pay a good 30/50 for them. for example the treasure of the emerald dragon that came out recently was only out for an hour and the items within it are amazing but are beyond comprehension and youd have to sell an unusual of tf2 in order to obtain it. its a fun game in itself, however im just a bit peeved that the developers would make it so impossible for fans to gain the cooler items they love and how some treasures are hidden from the public eye. download the game, love it for what it is and sell your soul to it; then realise you cant obtain the beautiful items you would like :)",3
"i like the community in this game, i recommend it!",4
"great game, but very difficult to learn ;). in my opinion best moba.",3
"a great game of strategies and combat. it is fun and enjoyable to play and more and more to learn as you progress through the levels. there are even great prizes to be won and fought for as you battle through your games.",1
"the best of its genre...and they do not make you buy the heros",2
"huge waste of your precious time. dont bother with it.",7

"team up with a bunch of friends or solo queue if youre forever alone. play against bots or go pubbing with people in your region or people from all around the world! whichever you choose, the game will be filled with fun, stress and a lot of giggles. overall an addictive game that you will keep on playing...",5
"this is a game which has taken hundreds of hours out of many peoples lives. it is a strtergy gae where, from a birds eye view you will fight the enemy team seeking to destroy their ancient/base. i would recommend it for anyon who likes stratergy games and doesnt hate people. if you want a truely amazing game, for free, this is for you.",4

"a really good game with good visuals and amazing gameplay, which is really easy to get into and has infinite replayability.",1
"taught me more russian than a russian teacher 10/10",4
"consumes most of your time, adding up that its very addictive. if you want action, like being cursed by players that comes from other countries even though youre the one carrying the game, cursing valve if you dont get good items while the feeder does, and want to learn different ways to curse in different languages. this is the game you should play.",7
"the best moba in the world. i recommend everyone to play.",3

"awesome game! if you tried it once and you dont like it, go home your drunk! if you like it and never played it before, play the tutorial, play alone vs bots, play with players vs bots and when you have played a few hours then try normal matchmaking. and always keep in mind, stay away from these russians....",5
"i hope the russians get nuked and never play dota again",1
"if you like the moba genre, youll love this game. just remember kids, play with friends, or else it sucks.",1

"dota2 was the first rts i played. and most likely will be the last one also. awesome game, takes some time to learn but after you get into the game, its mad fun and enjoyable. only minus is the sometimes-so-sh*tty -community. but just mute everyone and that shouldnt be a problem anymore! gl hf absolutely recommending this for everyone",7

"very punishing yet very rewarding. not for the faint hearted lol",10
"+ very deep, rich + addictive game + very competitive - bad community",6
"good game but lol is better cuz you dont have to deny so positioning becomes more important so its a more skilled game. also all this channeling times in dota2 are so long i have to wait foreva time is money lolol. btw many dota2 champions are just copies of the lol versions. there are some cosmetic items in dota2 but i think they do not change very much i prefer to confuse my opponent with skins so they do not know which champ im playing when i do my skilled ganks. its ridiculous that you have to spend almost the half of your all the gold you earned in one entire match for a in blink (its an item with this ability called blinkdagger) and cant chose it at beginning. nobody would buy such a crap item that does not even give any damage or stats lololol. see you in lol broz <3",3
"dota.... dota has its times where you play with your friends with a max team of 5... however things happe. when alone you are swarmed with asians, mexicans, russians , and maybe even aliens who would know. also aliens will watch and learn about the people in this world by peoples name calling and yelling. you will be screamed at by other languages and dont know what is going on. then you will be in games with blamers that blame everything on you. filled with racism and yelling 10/10",3

"very addictive.. easy to get started with.. a must-have!",7
"life is too good? friends are too kind with you? you have lost taste of begin mocked by random people? install this and play it a week. from the question of gameplay, i can say - this is not moba, its like tf2+csgo in thirdperson and you use mouse to move around and keyboard to shoot, simple.",5

"you just get yelled at by peruvians and russians all day. why is this game so popular again? edit: worst community ive seen in a game. seriously. dont play this game.",6
"1,587 hours on record for a reason. this game is more competitive and less childish than my previous game and train wreck of a dota-like accectable choice league of legends. yes the dota 2 community is rough but that is how it has been since dota on wc3. harder than usual to walk into and get going at first because of the vast knowledge of the game but replays can easily fix that in a day. overall great game and once again,  league of legends.",7

"the day i downloaded dota, my life fell apart. i sold my wife to get murder of crows. i sold my 2 slaves and 3 children for the international 4 compendium. everyday i continue to play. maybe one day when i reach 0.2k mmr ee will give me kisserino. my keyboard is covered in the lotion on my fingers, my seat covered in hemerrhoids blood. every sleeping session, i dream of arteezy giving me money for more lotion. i sleep for two minutes every day, because i need to stream on twitcherino. hipyrit is my mother. i may have to sell her for more lotion. i have already sold my father, smax253. if anyone can donate me more people, i can buy more lotion and play gamerino for 20000 hours.",5
"league of flamers served no less as mere training for dota 2, which holds in my opinion the state of best moba/arts/asss (call it however you want) around. no need to pay for heroes or power-ups. no need to grind levels to be able to jungle. no need to pay for cosmetics, i can earn them while playing. and i can learn russian free of charge. the essence and magic of dota combined with the powerful source engine and wrapped up in an user-friendly package with valve quality finition. icing on the cake ? the only moba around playable offline. and bots arent exactly dummies.",4
"the latest effort in making a full-fledged game out of a warcraft iii mod. dota 2 places you and up to 9 other people in an arena like environment where a never ending war between good and evil is taking place. after choosing around 100 heroes (with more coming) and dozens upon dozens of items to help give your hero the edge, the game does not stop giving you something to strive for, whether it be mastering the latest hero release, or finding the perfect build for your role of choice. install as soon as humanly possible.",6

"ok this game is really good moba game. i know i have only 1-2h played but this is cuz moba games are boring for me :d i recommend this game for moba fans :)",1
"dota 2 is a fun and energetic game. there is a diverse roster of heroes to choose from that each have there own unique abilities so youll never get bored. you can buy character sets, announcers, hud skins, couriers, and loading screens to customize the way you want your game to look. it is difficult when you are new to it, but youll eventually get the hang of it. i recommend this game to almost anyone in the steam community, and the good thing is....its free!!!",5
"just have patience for the brutal learning curve. once you get past that, its very rewarding and fun! just find people to play with who are your skill level, dont always play solo queue. you need to win sometimes!",3
"this game is truly amazing! you will have to stick with it for about 10 games before you begin to like it but afterwards it is a hardcore stratergy game, where you will have to work with your team if you have any hope for victory. i know from personal experience that once you have gotten into the game you just want to play more and with the new updates dota has really progressed and delivered a full fun game for everyone to play.",7
"a competitive team oriented game. i would say at least give it a shot.",1
"hands down best game i ever played.it is so much fun,specially if you are playing with friends and it never gets old.",8
"its is a very good game with good balancing and intersting abilities, but as you probaly read before, you can compare the communitie with a waste bin. people will just scream at you when you do someting wrong and leave the game after that and dont forget the famous mid or feed strategy. communication in this game is hard, the game does it good at that point, but then the russians and arabians or whatever show up when you clearly clicked eu-west and that you want to meet up with english people instead of other language. so yeah, game is perfectly with regulary updates and interesting events, but the communitie really needs to get better (i mean a lot better) or valve should just link english people with real english people and auto search for the best server instead of choosing the server. i would say 9.5/10 for the game (nothing is perfect) and 2/10 for the communitie (sometimes you meet a nice person)",3
"best strategy game ever, try this n u will never regret it. this game is free to play,",3
"a great game to play with or without your friends, depending on how much you tolerate the randoms. you will eventually lose your cool and go bananas. 10/10 have fun :d",4
"can be a bit difficult to get to learn, but if you put the time into learnnig then it is brilliant. espacially when you have a team of friends to play with as tactics play a huge part in winning.",1
"a dynamic system to entertain the mind, train your brain/memory, enjoy great pvp and develop leadership, teamwork, foresight, calculation and prediction skills. a varied cast of characters each with their own skill set and a wide range of items to help with customization of the way you want to play. an interesting community ranging from great, co-operative players and impressive enemies, to the lowest gamer quality which require you to develop patience and restraint. if you consider picking this game up, remember, there is a high learning curve, therefore you must be prepared to fall and rise again in the never-ending battle between the dire and the radiant. good luck, have fun",4

"game is  8/10 would not recommend to my worst enemy shout-out to boppe, most likely the worst dota player in the entire world, and also to juel, probably the most annoying opponent ever, due to his tendency of playing techies. valva... pelase fix ur game -.-",3

"its a true free to play game, no hero purchases or rotations needed. you need never to spend a penny on this game if you dont want too. with over 700 hours clocked in and a larger player base than wow id reccomend it to anyone... oh yea and the pros play for 10 meeelion dollars!!",3
"really good game, addicted and still playing, dota is my life",7
"game is good, it has potential .. but players are in most cases immature, angry, rude kids",4
"very awesome game. addicting and you cant get enough.",10
"challenging game, if new play tutorial!!! this game will take time to learn, so dont worry if you havnt gotten much better since you started playing. watch basic tips and listen to teammates. this game will sap hours and hours away from your life but i still dont regret playing it!",3
"nice game and not bored cause every update this game u can find a great fantasy",3

"better than lol that is for nooby 10 yr olds. great graphics, quite hard but really fun to play.",4
"i love this game more than i love anyone..the best ing game ever!",2
"this game has not got much to it on paper; 2 teams with a base each with 3 ways in defended by evenly placed towers. however, it is still playable and addictive with loads of characters and item combinations across teams each game is different and lasts about 30-40 mins. it started as a warcraft 3 mod so expect some familiar concepts. it is going to be free to play at some point so when it is i would at least give it a go you can also buy cosmetic items but nothing to give an advantage over the moaning cheapskates ;-)",1
"after playing many mobas, dota 2 continues to be the most polished option out there yet.",1
"i was kind of skeptical at first cuz the game was free, but i am so glad i downloaded it! it is one of the most addictive games i play! i give this game a 10 out of 10! cheers",2

"this is the game i never get tired of playing!! recommended for hardcore gamers!",3
"coming from a league of legends noob, i can truly say its been fun learning the mechanics of this game, and ill probably play it more than going back to lol. my friend claims im betraying him because he only plays league, but i hope hell join me on the dark side sometime. ...or should i say, the dire side! :p",1

"what to say about dota 2? great, intense game that grows on you if you let it! huge variety of different heros with different skills! worst community i ever expirienced in my whole life... (and ive seen a lot) matchmaking more than questionable...",4
"dota 2 is incredibly deep game, in a sense - is absolute. such variation you will not find almost any other game, except perhaps that of direct competitors in the same genre. but they are few, and they are usually made worse. unreliable players here not applicable, as send out a separate circle of hell, where they play with the other trolls and flamers. this helps to re-educate those in whom the piece is still some reasonable and good, but finally lost souls will cook in this pot forever.  of",4
"before i downloaded this game, i had a life. but then........",7
"i so love this game! even before i was still playing dota 1, i was always looking forward to release this game so soon so that my friends and i will be able to play dota 2. having played this game is very nice. i would love and surely recommend this game to more of my friends.",3

"this game teaches you fundamental life skills such as laziness, fear of going outside, anger, and last but not least, racism. /10 would recommend",2
"there is only one word that can describe this game: amazing! dota is the ultimate moba experience offering a large variety of well balanced heroes, suitable for any kind of player. every match has different teams that require different tactics to defeat. i like it how valve isnt greedy, as every cosmetic item in the game can be obtained by simply playing it. actually, the best items in the game can be obtained like this, considering that the shop offerst mostly uncommon items, that are available for a limited period. the only thing i dislike about this game is that sometimes people take it too seriously and forget to enjoy it. if you liked this review then feel free to give me free stuff.",5
"awesome moba game that its prior version sparked the growth of mobas in general. dota was a mod for warcraft 3 and soon became a major reason for the purchase of that game. dota 2 is a standalone that has better graphics and is still being updated with new heroes from the old game and with new game modes. it is fun for new people to try out since there is a tutorial system that teaches you the basics of the game. plus they also added a coaching system where you can directly talk with your coach during a game to learn things from them. very awesome game and it is free to play, so good reason to try out. graphics: 9 - awesome graphics especially going from the original mod sound: 9 - great sound gameplay: 9.5 - great gameplay, need so much awareness story: no story",3

"its like starcraft, but with less headache. its nothing like starcraft. through the process of living dota 2, youre enlightened to the fact that all other video games are empty illusions meant to dull your senses to the odious reality of the perpetual war we wage on life. dota 2 is not a video game in that sense. no, dota 2 is a story about who you really are.",1

"clearly a poor attempt at marketing towards the lol consumers, this game copies every aspect of lol, along with adding crappy new elements such as killing your own minions and towers which is dumb, stupid donkeys (obvious videogamedunkey refrence towards lol players to better suit them) instead of recall, and is super hard. this game sucks because you automatically get every champion and they are all confusing other than sniper which has to be the most skilled champion in this copy cat of a game. do not play this game, play lol 11/10",5
"dota 2 adds a great deal of complexity to the moba genre. its balance tenet is: everything goes. there is no character that is underpowered; in fact, theyre all overpowered in their own way. the game places a great burden of knowledge over whoever tries it out. be sure to stick to co-op games for starters. the tutorial may prepare you slightly, but the game as a whole is a lot more complex than other mobas on the market. oh, and the saying it aint over till its over applies here. you cant be sure youre winning until the radiant/dire goes down. lots of rooms for comebacks in here, but the game is far more snowbally than other mobas.",1

"i highly recommend this over its competitor, rosetta stone. while rosetta stone promised adaptive learning, social sharing, and community learning, i found dota 2 to be a much better product in terms of cultural exposure and hands on training. unlike rosetta stone, dota 2 matches you up with real spanish-speakers, russian-speakers, or dirty pinoys that are fresh off the boat and ready to help you delve into their ethnic practices and language. as an english speaker, i learned the peruvian dialect of spanish in less than 3 months solely playing dota 2 for an hour a day. i highly recommend this game. as we say in spanish, jajajajajaj gringo noob la  madre concha tu madre. idiota hijo de la gran  calla csm. que huevon eres. pajero de  .l. jajajajaj xddd.",5

"i thing the game is good if you have a good pc lolololol",1
"while it can take awhile to get the hang of this game, as it has a steep learning curve, it is extremely rewarding when it starts to click. its a challenging game that is fun to play with friends. its not always going to be sunshine and roses, but it will keep you playing due to the variety of heroes and people that you will meet. also, what impresses me the most about this game is how balanced it is. there is absolutely no way for someone to purchase an item with real money that will gain them an advantage in the game. all of the items you can buy are purely cosmetic. and the heroes are all quite balanced, and can all be countered. highly recommend this fun game! dont be discouraged if it doesnt click right away, itll get better. :)",1

"the game that makes you hate your friends and love random people! its dota2, you dont need a review! its awesome!",5
"its an amazing game - technically outstanding, showing all of valves usual polish and attention to detail, especially in the all-important multiplayer aspects. the continual balance tweaks and new heroes combined with the vast amount of content in the game offer countless hours of enjoyment. its hard to master but good wins with your teammates are incredibly satisfying. it took me a long time to warm up to, but im helplessly addicted and every day look forward to getting home to fire this up with my friends. if you can spare the time - play it.",2

"first of all, there appears to be no need to ever buy this game. someone with 10 copies of this will gift one to one of your friends, who will find his copy multiplied by 10, who can then give one to you. now, should you actually play it? sure - its got unusuals and crates and all that jazz, so its basically team fortress 2 for boring people. be prepared for a steep learning curve, lots of abuse and a vocabulary full of words that will make your friends cringe. you got ganked son. enjoy your 10 copies of this game.",1

"if you are ready to lose your social life for tons of fun kill donkeys with sticks and play with russians then this game is for you but really dont be a riki player t_t",2
"i have to admit its a pretty fun game, after playing it for a while, it really does feel like most of the heroes are completely unbalanced. if youre going against an experienced team or even higher difficulty bots, youre bound to struggle and get frustrated. im kind of on and off with this game, but i uninstalled and really dont feel like playing again. new players are going to find this game hard to play, especially when matched with more experienced players, it takes time to even figure out what to do most of the game after starting and before ending. everyone should at least try it!",1

"ahhh.... dota 2. this game is severaly unbalanced since no matter how well you play, your team will always blame you for the loss. it is also insanely luck based because the team that gets most russians usually looses. a lot of functions in this game are completely broken as well. for example, even if you pick english in the language bar everyone still speaks russian. sometimes german or french, but never english. playing this game i had a few mental breakdowns and smashed three windows in total. it sometimes feels like my life is fading away and i imagine life in prison with a really musculine in-mate would provide the same level of . to sum up, this is game is ing terrible. 10/10 would recommend.",7

"the russians, autistic 6 year old asian children, and a handful of normal people are what make this game a great game. 10/10",3
"this game is definately worth the price: free. the community is friendly and willing to teach if youre new to the genre. if youve played any rts game in the past ten years, youll be able to figure this game out pretty easily. with around 100 heroes and counting, this game has a great deal of variety and will always be challenging. unlike many free to play games, this games micro-transaction model is aesthetic only. there are no huge powerups or big weapons or purchases of in-game currency that will give the payer an edge over others. this game is very much the antithesis of the pay-to-win model.",1

"addictive and fun gameplay, best played with friends. if you dont like strategy or action rgp with bird point of view, this is not your game.",7
"much better then league of legends. this is coming from someone who played lol since beta up until 6 months ago. dota 2 shines above other games in the genre for these reasons; 1. hero versatility 2. learning curve is steeper but more rewarding 3. games snowball less, but if they do its for the right reasons. 4. games are less likely to be decided early therefore there is always plenty of time for a comeback. overall, the game is much more rewarding for someone who is starting out in this genre, highly recommended!",7
"it will take every second of your free time, and that will never be enough. totally recommend .",7
"okay well about two years after my first review i thought it was a good time to revisit this. this is by far the bestfree game out there(i have spent too much money on tourney tickets and .) and any of you losers still playing league of legends really need to take a step back and think about your life. are you ever going to take off the training wheels and step up your game? probably not, because youve become too used to babys first dota and the thought of having access to all the heroes is too daunting and youd rather only have the small pool of free heroes to select from. because you dont like having fun. and you like spending money on things that should have been free from the start. if you dont want to buy cosmetics or tourney tickets then all this game will cost you is your sanity and your faith in the human race. 11/10 would sacrifice firstborn to continue to play",7

"when i was updating dota 2, my pc was forcely shut down due to technical problems. and when i opened my steam after technical problems were solved, my dota 2 was uninstalled and it wasnt a problem to me cause i was in a good mood and had a long patience. so i re-installed dota 2, and whenever i pause the download in order to shutdown my pc for some work to do, i thought that the amount of data installed (ex.2.5gb) would remain but after i turned on my pc and checked resumed the download of my dota 2. the amount of data installed went down to mb and i was frustated to this, and my point is that is there a problem in the steam and i want to know why my dota 2 was uninstalled without doing it manually (ex. through control panel, etc.)",1

"dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably wont suit you if youre looking to play casually. theres a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent at it. but once you start to learn its secrets, theres a wild and exciting variety of play here thats unmatched, even by its peers. its a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. the fact that its completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could be isnt just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. may the best team win.",4

"highly addictive moba based off warcraft 3 and massively updated by valve. the game play is very well tuned with balance updates pretty regularly. the patches are worth looking forward and the free-to-play model is brilliant. that said, this game has one of the worst gaming communities i have ever been a part of. utterly shocking behaviour almost every game by at least one player. this game painfully needs a ban list to avoid being with these people more than once. bring friends for the best experience.",6

"pretty decent game with new heroes added in as well as some cool effects but nothing beats the original dota",2
"this strategy/rpg hybrid is an amazing fast paced battle arena. the only bad thing about this kind of game is that a part of the community is really awful, criticizing your every move in game. anyway, give it a try, specially if you are into strategy and rpg.",5

"dota 2 is, in my eyes, the best game ever made. if it werent for the overbearing ignorance of the people that play this game, that thrive only on making others angry with said ignorance. this game could have been so much more. that being said, i recommend you get a few of your friends together to play with you. if you can get a group of 3-5 people to play this with. there is no better game. win or lose, my friends and i have a blast every game. showing off our skilled plays and laughing at each others blunders. unfortunately if you are a lone gamer, you will end up with that same type of person in your group often. that one guy that cant play to have fun. his idea of fun is to have the whole team verbally abusing someone for a single mistake for an entire hour long game. that being said, i would give this game a 9/10. the one point deduction due to the moba community being a bunch of *ssholes.",8
"the community can tell you firsthand that this game is quite possibly the best and worst game on earth. with the recent boom in its e-sports presence its worth trying for that reason alone. you may love it or hate it but one things for certain. those who love it, really love it (myself included).",3

"the best games ! (y) nice.. but have daily update so why ?",1
"dota 2 is most importantly a free game, so the only thing you lose by trying it is time and some bandwidth. dota 2 not only is a game, but is the best language learning tool. i learned fluent russian, portugese, and spanish in only a few games! its better and cheaper than rosetta stone, and uses fun games to teach! i reccomend this to everyone. edit: its dangerous to go alone, take this.",2
"one of the best game ive ever played............ far better than any other online game out there.........",6
"tough learning curve because youll likely play with some pros that have been playing dota since patch 0.000001 and your team will likely consist of people that understand enough english to insult you but not enough to be of any use in team fights or other strat stuff. huehuehue. get a solid team to play with and its much better. also practice against ais for like a month before stepping foot into a person vs person game.",1

"mute toxic players and you will enjoy hard to learn, but fun to play game.",5
"a wonderous 5 lane world of 20 kill supports, 1 v 5 heroics and lost russians. each game guarantees: -a noob who does exactly the opposite of what the team suggests, this is a great time to practise reverse psychology. -at least some form of russian, be it english players that enjoy their newly learned dialect or a genuine player of russia who due to their 3rd world conditions are obviously too famished to actually play the game properly. -a pudge pro that insists on mid and then deems it a great time to showcase exactly how not to attempt to hook players for all of 27 minutes while the other steam rolls you entirely. -a support with a dagon. with numerous repetition of the line but i thought he was getting away while he is now 4 levels above the medusa right next to him. in summary this game will make you very... very... angry. a lot of the time. i cant go a single day without playing it.",5
