"garrys mod (gm) is a virtual world developed by linden lab launched on june 23, 2003, and is accessible on the internet. a free client program called the viewer enables its users, called residents, to interact with each other through avatars. residents can explore, meet other residents, socialize, participate in individual and group activities, and create and trade virtual property and services with one another, or travel throughout the world (which residents refer to as the grid). garrys mod is for people aged 18 and over.",1

"garrys mod is a random sanbox game perfect for browsing the random creations of other people or making your own. this game brings skill and comedy together to make a crazy game filled with mayhem. although there are funny moments and fun mayhem the minds of many players can be rude and post dupes that have rude things. due to this problem, this game is unsutable for small children. over all this game can get boring and leave you hanging. due to these many great and quite discusting things i give this game a 7/10.",1
"well, my first review now. garrys mod is a game you rly should buy because you can have so much fun with that. the best of this game is that you dont have just one game. you have many different games in one. so u can play prop hunt or murderer or dark rp or many many maaaany other mods. thats why i advise gmod to everyone who likes to play many different things. and also the community of gmod are mostly nice and friendly.",1
"great game for playing online definatly worth the price",1

"its great ive wasted over 2 months of my life on this game buy it or you suck",4
"i fail to see the logic in why you have to read this review to know how limitless this game is if a game doesnt have limits then therefore it would be impossible for it not to appeal to anyone im not some extremist with over 1000 hours, but i know a great game when i see one is this even a game? its like an empire i swear i dont even know how to explain it its just so massive and endless... its also really silly sometimes... and its always super fun im obsessed with the concept, even if my playtime seems to disagree. just trust me. im fairly certain that it would be impossible to regret buying this game. :)",1

"garrys mod is probably one of the most time consuming games that i have ever played, besides tf2 of course (+700h) garrys mod is a sandbox game that can turn into anything, at first your building something, and then minutes later youre playing prop hunt or ttt. i strongly reccomend garrys mod, its essential to your steam library.",1

"the most unique game ive seen out there. want to make a giant robot that is on fire and shoots lazers. i bet you have, and with all the parts, ragdolls, and tools in the game, plus mods you can download automatically from the menu, you can totally make it. and with some ridiculous game modes in multiplayer like trouble in terrorist town and deathrun, its sure to be a fun game.",1
"you can do cool things in this game... ...or you can make the stupidest things imaginable, like me. 11/10 would melon again.",1
"my review is yes and no. pros: on pc it will work great no problems whatso ever it has many fun gamemodes and all that stuff cons: this game is very badly optimised for macs and will crash on most servers you try and join as many people have complained on the forums but just get completely ignored. fix your ing game for the mac users facepunch",1

"this game has got something for everyone. if you want to shoot terroists then there is ttt, if you want to play hide and seek there is prop hunt, if you want to watch funny videos there is cinema. and finally, if you want to make giant  out of assorted construction materials, there is sandbox. any person, any race, any gender, any species. garrys mod is the game for you!",1
"i love the game, and all the gamemodes. the only thing that is making me dislike this game with a passion, is a bug thats not allowing me to veiw any servers. hopefully it will be fixed. as i have read, not everyone is having this problem, but it is happaning.. and the problem has been around for more then a year or two.. maybe its not a bug but who knows. but asides that, the game is great, and has many gamemodes for you to play... basicly no matter what you are into game wise. this game has a game for you! its a great game inside a great game! so get it and enjoy it!",1

"the only game where you will have a addon folder on 50gb in a few days.",1
"this game muliplayer is best time in the whole world. you can bulid or play do doing anything you want. they sure make more game like garry mod/tr2014 or............... becasue those game are the best to not be contral what you have to do.",1
"i greatly enjoyed this game and played the heck out of it. it is based on the half-life 2 engine, but it makes it a smoother game than it would be with others. it has an amazing amount of workshop items to mess around with. i would suggest this to anyone that enjoys a casual, hardcore, or creative game.",1
"neat game. has a lot of good custom game modes to mess around with, could cater for all sorts of gamers.",1
"like one of the best games ever. so many little boys to touch! :d",1

"hey there, its me, that guy who buys too many games and doesnt play them for long. you know what i like? a game with no bugs, a game with a decent storyline, a game that has working features. garrys mod is the total opposite. more bugs than you have vram, no storyline, working features? pfft. however, garrys mod isnt a game now is it? this is a wtf sim, with things such as rollercoasters and  chairs, and all things in between. all user created. all . all gmod. 124/10",1
"this game is amazing. great fun endless possibilities and i definetely reccomending",1
"if you like modifications, then i highly recommend this game.",2
"you can do anything you want on this game! i would advise you get counter strike, or you will have missing textures on some maps.",1
"love this game right here, always to throw down in trouble in terroist town. it is a bunch of game taken and moved under one game. this is a must have, when you first come to steam.",1
"help!!! when i open gmod it appears at the top left of my screen in full screen and its like i clicked and draged it to the top left so all i can see the bottom right of the window of the game and the rest is black, has anyone else had this problem and could you please help?!",1

"this game is one of the best games ive ever played. you need cs:s but theres other ways to get the textures. buy this game if you have any sense of fun.",1
"endless fun, especially with all the add-ons. multiplayer is even more awesome, and i laugh hysterically every time i play this. get it nao.",1
"you can do litterly anything in gmod, from a world war 2 roleplay to a future roleplay, with many addons you can subscribe to and download, you can make your game a living fantasy, with source engine games that you can compare in garrys mod and many other games! in my opinion, best game ive played so far!!",4
"awesome game allows you to do what ever you want pretty much!",1
"its fun for the first 20 hours, but then runs dry. i enjoyed just messing around with it at first, but now i find it hard to enjoy, because every gamemode feels exactly the same. also, its hard to find servers that arent wasting your time and storage by downloading 50 useless anime skins for people who they think will actually donate to them. great when starting out and if you get really good, but is otherwise just a grind.",1
"the most customizable game that i have seen. it has everything, and you can add more, from half life 2 vechicles to this... is... sparta! the biggest sandbox game so far. with hundreds of gamemodes and thousands of addons that you can put five more hours of gameplay into per addon, you will never be bored by this stunning combination of build-it-yourself singleplayer and fantastic fan-made multiplayer. you will find yourself inserting months into this game, and you will be hooked on it for years, as new updates come out to make it even better. in all honesty, if you would love to put years of your time into a game, this would be the one for you.",3
"awesome game i love it. if you liike sandbox games i would recommend this to you.",1
"an amazing game you will never get enought i recommend this to all age groups.",1
"i love it so much but i dont want to spend 20 dollars just to get the textures :(",1
"you can spawn things. lots of things. you can get mods. lots of mods. you can do a yolo. lots of yolo. why not get this game? for alot of your buds! :d",1
"played a gta online server met a man who had a fake name in the server named eric high as we jumped into the water my game crashed the last thing i heard him say was if i dont make it tell my mom i love her so if he did not make erics mom he loves you 10000000000/5 i miss eric",3
"very fun game. enjoy a lot with your friends. love this game!",1
"its a game that is best played with friends no friends no fun no mods no fun",1
"garrys mod is the perfect game for anybody who wants a true sandbox, physic-based building game. since it uses the same engine as half life 2, it has all the awesome physics and characteristics as half life. perfect for making anything from a simple building, to a custom made car comprized of working suspension systems, thrusters, pullies, wheels, and balloons for flight. this game literally allows you to do anything that you want. 10/10 enjoy.",1
"....yes....es....... ...yes....es!!! fuuuuccckkkk yyeeeeesss!!! oohhh my godddd!!! hell yes! this game is amazing!",5
"(you need to be creative to have more fun in this game)",1
"overall game quality: beyond recommended game has too much fun for me to handle over 9000/10",1
"do what ever crap you want. make the spy crap like hell... thats possible.",1
"i hail from second life...its a similar game that came out several years before garrys mod but with  graphics and an even ier community. came here looking for a replacement for secondlife. wish my friends from there could join me",1
"really fun game. endless choices of fun and creativity.",1
"i love this game it is the best game in the world to me",2
"garrys mod is an amaing game. there is so much to do, so many possibilities. there is new content avalible everyday, from the steam workshop, or even a new gamemode. you can play an old classic like trouble in terrorist town, or you can play the newer murder gamemode. there is so much you can see and do in garrys mod. and i will continue to play it in the future because of the growing community that makes such amazing things. i give garrys mod a 10/10",2
"best game ever!!!!!!! theres so much stuff to do!you can get sweet mods and build and...anything!!!theres gamemodes like sled-build,dark rp,murder,and so much more!!!10/10.",2
"one does not simply not own gmod. buy this game. nao. 10/10 potatoes.",2
"garrys mod is a fantastic game, and in my experience (albiet a short one compared to most other people that have it) has been a fantastic one. if you can think it, you can do, build, create it. garrys mod is one of the few games that is only limited by your own imagination, and thats why i love it. in fact calling it a game is an understatement, its a whole world of its own, its what you make of it. i have experienced very few errors in the game, and the ones that i have experienced were so minute that it hardly affected the gameplay in any way. it is a truly remarkable title and i highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.",1
"10/10 game but missing textures ruin the experience for me.",1
"epic. nice to once in a wile not to have objectave... but the physics is werd. but you soon get used to that.",1

"this is the best game ever and im sorry if you do not have it and try goat simulator",1
"imagine a game where you can do whatever you want. this is what that is. imagination is your priority. play lots of gamemodes or even make your own server and have fun with friends.",3
"dont you hate it when you buy this full price, then they rapidly increase discounts right after. anyways my review is recommended but only just, its a fun game, good with friends but alot of pointless downloads that waste space..",1
"if you want to do everything in one game just buy and play gmod 11/10",1
"all of your gaben dreams rolled into one 9.99 game, where you can go slow motion, do a 360 no scope, get a headshot while playing as shrek has never been more fun!( you just might want to get the valve complete pack if you want a full experience).10/10 a must have on steam",1
"omgdisgameissogoodushouldbuyit(translation: this game is very good,i love it a lot.you can goof around on singleplayer and make random contraptions or play multiplayer online.it has many different gamemodes that i can play online and i can also install addons to make the game a bit better.",1
"1479 hours already and yet still not bored very very great game",4
"this game is the best sandbox and custom game i ever played i enjoy this alot you can do whatever you want with it :)",1
"i think the creators went overboard with this invention, with their countless gamemodes that take downloading, and countless different areas, if made basic would be an amazing game, but unfortunately they need to specify everything. i do not recommend this, waste of money personally.",1
"build whatever the fudge you wanna build! ps: also has alot of other gamemodes :>",1
"all those bad comments are only about it that guys didnt load any mods, and that is really really sad.",2
"very fun, kinda weird to get used to the building style but with a couple and a beer its an awesome game you only pay one and all the addons are free. get it. -luke",2

"this is a very great game and love playing, modding and just plain screwing around in this game. this game is already the best sandbox game i have ever played, and in my personal opinion; this beats minecraft in my book. in this the more games you own the better or you can just grab some mods and fool around with your friends. this was money well spent and i recommend everyone with $10 in their account to buy this amazing jewel.",1
"if this game was real life. then real life would be very ed up.",2
"1 of the best sandbox games of all time ! -its not a game...its your world do anything you want ! thegamer101.",1
"=====================================================================================g mod is a awsome game and i love playing it!!!!!!! i would reccomend it to anyone saying its worth the money as it really is !!!!!.............. ===================================================================================== ===================================================================================== but sometimes i can not get on it i load it up and then it says hl2 exe has stopped working i gwt really mad at this as it is my fave game to play on steam can someone plz tell me why this is happening........... plz",1

"garrys mod is a time sink, there is no other way to describe it. however it is some of the most fun you can have with your pc, the community made maps, addons, characters, and gamemodes are amazing. they allow the player to explore different online gamemodes allowing for hours of fun. and yes, there is a mod for a watermelon firing cannon. enough said.",1
"its a sandbox single player and multyplayer and it as mods its a really cool game 9/10",3

"there are many many many different gamemodes, and they are all hilarious. garrys mod is technically a sandbox game, but there are so many custom gamemodes such as trouble in terrorist town or prop hunt that it is more like a huge game that includes many small minigames. a bit like mario and sonic at the olympic games or wii party. one big game that has many gamemodes. definitely recommend, it never gets old as the people you play with are constantly changing. the community is welcoming and kind. i would also advise you have some form of microphone, as it is more preferable to speak to people that type it in chat.",1

"buddy, stop browsing the reviews like you dont know whether to buy it or not. you can literally do anything in this game! first thing i ever did was build a flying bathtub with a tv and a microwave on it, then i went on a zombie killing-spree. counter-strike: source is needed for many textures/models, and the game has some bugs, mainly because most of the fun stuff in the game is user-made steam workshop content. i have subscribed to ~170 gmod workshop items. 10/10",1

"this is one of my favorite games because not only is it easy to make new friends but its also fun to play. once you get the game you are able to go into single player or multiplayer. for single player you can get cool addons to improve the game, and if your more of a multiplayer person then thats okay too because there aton of games to choose from, you can play gta, murder or one of my peronal favorites jail break. garrys mod or g-mod if youd like to call it, also allows you to make your own servers so you can play /w your friends. -lord pancake",1

"this game is a total bucket of s*it. but just to make sure i played 650 hours on it, and after complete analysis of the ins and outs of the game i conclude that garry made this game while on coke or some sort of liquid that was extracted from an monkeys but hole. the worst thing about this game is that its not an xbox one exclucive, if it was then it would be so much better becuase you would be able to watch tv while playing this s*it stane of an game. garry newman has made alot of mistakes, like not letting his company be sucked into the anal cavity of microsofts massive flabering a*s that consumes any small comany and mashes it up into some shoe f*ck of a corperation that make kinect games. kind regards, pies p.s if you agree with me you should get tested",4

"this game is amazing, well i could say game(s) since its filled with diffrent kind of servers in which you can do different stuff like rp (roleplaying) ttt (trouble in terrorist town) and many others. i would say get this game for an amazing fun for hours and hours on end. the only bad thing about it is you should get cs:s (counter strike: source) since many server need it for textures, modles and other stuff. 9.5/10 must get",3
"funniest sandbox game i personally ever owned. great place to let your fantasy flow, awsome community members, wich are also sharing the best mods and tweaks. a true must have!",1
"i bought this game to play prop hunt, but i became addicted to trouble in terrorist town. the communities are fantastic, on the whole, and they make you feel welcome. all in all, a great online multiplayer experience. counter strike source is recommended too, for extra textures and content. i have yet to play with the actual sandbox properly, but i will leave that to the pros. i am having too much fun with whats already out there.",1
"i will be honest i suck at this game and hope to find out ow to get better but i do recommend it if you can figure out its weird controls. 8/10",1
"if you a reading this review because you have not purchased this game and are thinking about getting it, stop. purchase the game already. you can literally do anything inside of garrys mod.",1
"i love this game. it has a huge variety of gamemodes and a decent community. although its hard to make private servers for you and your freinds if you dont want to play with randoms, it is still possible. (google it) i would recommend you buy this game and give it a few weeks to both get used to the game and find your favorite gamemode. personally if i were you, play the darkrp gamemode after you get into the game or experienced. (5-10 hours) of course this is just my opinion and you should take these words lightly. (i still recommend this game)",1
"garrys mod is a great example of how we are not done creating new genres for games. have you ever played a game saying, hey i wish i could use this weapon in another of my games. or even i wonder what it would be like if i could launch mario into orbit. okay probably not the second one, but still this is a great and truly immersive game that combines the best parts of our favorite games. what genre of game is this? well lets see... it can be a sandbox game, both first and third person shooter, multiplayer, horror, modable, indie, action, and much much more. garrys mod lets you decide what to do and is never restricted except by your imagination. i reccomend this game for a fan of sandbox games or even someone who wants a good laugh.",1
"dont buy unlesss you are prepared to pay another 20 dollars for a less than average shooter with guns and terroists or you can pay nothing and risk getting a virus ^.^ but seriously dont buy without getting counter strike source or you will have way less fun in multiplayer",1

"a game that is meant to be a sandbox. but thanks to the hard-working community has turned this one game into hundreds of different games. whether it be trouble in terrorist town, prop hunt, darkrp, ultimate chimera hunt, the sky is the limit for how much fun you can have. one of the best games ever and in my opinion a must-buy. this provides infinite entertainment, whether for a regular smalltime gamer, or your hardcore mlg pro.",2

"this is a very great game and i think the fun of this game is never going to end as they add more stuff more fun comes in place but if you want the full experience of this game you will need counter strike:source and other games that have stuff in it like team fortress 2 and css (counter strike:source) is mainly the only other thing you need but other wise the game is great",1

"now, out of all my experiences with videogames throughout my life, i have never come across a game where basically anything is possible. with its nearly infinite game modes to its creative objects, snpcs, entities, vehicles, etc... this game brings out the creative side of you. for example in the generic game mode sandbox you can weld together a desk and a rocket to create a fully operational spaceship with epic internet (results may vary, most likely it will just fly out into oblivion). or you could make a tea party with woody from toystory  and solid snake from the metal gear solid series . an incredibly fun game.",1

"best game ever! al, game are in this game! if you didnt buy a game, buy this! this game is awesome!",1
"ill have to say its one of the best pc games if you have the canche to buy it teally do it its the most fun with friends you can 100+ hours of laughing screaming at horror maps. pros -you can play it for hours -its cheap -it has a low engine -you can download dlcs for free -it has a online feature -over 30 gamemodes -mic support -you have a nyan cat gun cons -if you are playing in a homemade server you are getting many lua errors -its not the best looking game i would give it a 9/10.",1

"this is a very good game. its hours upon hours of fun, especially with other steam friends. i would most definetely recommend this game to all of my friends that enjoy steam games.",1
"my favorite game of all time! i love the game modes and players in the game! this is a real adventure!",2
"5 spent on this amazing game i recommed it to people who like playing with friends it includes everything i would want a game to have!",1
"this game is really fun with the mods; prop hunt ( you kelvin, prop hunt is a good mod), trouble in terrorist town and many more. ttt is fun and annoying depending on the server you play and the players you play with, cause for all you can know youre playing with pre-pube s who dont know jack .",1
"just an awesome game made on the source engine , do whatever you want to !",1
"good game , i give it a 8/10 and its quite annoying that you have to download the textures on the internet.",1

"great game, almost endless possibilities. children playing the game is the main problem, but once you settle into a home server on your gamemode (ttt in my case) its just a great time whenever you play. couple that with a few really good friends who you can mess around with and you have got one hell of a fun game.",2
"this is garrys mod (hence the name). a game where everythings controlled by you, the player. theres countless ways to enjoy this game, be it just building things, shooting stuff, or just messing around. you are the one who decides the way the game is played. to play this game you must own one or any of the source games since it uses them to get the textures, models and whatnot. theress also the steam workshop (recently added for this game) which replaces the toybox and it lets you easily download and install addons such as more models, weapons, maps, gamemodes, etc. so overall, if you like to mess around with friends, enjoy various game types, or just want to create things, then this game is well worth your time and you will most definitely like it.",1
"i love this game, if you wat to make some friends i would play on the darkrp servers. darkrp is a type of roleplaying serever where you pick a job and play as that character. i have many friends who play this game. buy this game if you want a good deal",1
"nice game i love this game and im going to play it hihi l.t: its fun!!!",1
"i love gmod but at times its kinda difficult to contol which i mean i mean confusing. the game modes though is what most people perfer even perfer them mostly their already set up for u and u just play it. i do think they could update it so it stops crashing maybe its my computer other wise this game is really fun but really its more fun with friends",1
"you dont know what you are missing out on...definitely the most expandable and ever-changing mod i have ever played. i normally get bored of games pretty quickly, but hence the amount of playtime i have with this, it has never ceased to stop entertaining me. the community is very diverse, and depending on what directions you take you will probably find your niche easy. some of the gamemodes play like they could be a game just by themselves, but in any means you can never get bored if you keep trying new things. and singleplayer/sandbox is already perfect enough in that matter, if you find the loading times worth it. very developer-friendly too, it uses lua and as time goes on more and more hooks are being updated and added. definitely worth a script-kiddies time.",5
"day 1... i have no idea whats going on here, but the kids seem to...",1
"10/10 i absolutly love this game, after 500+ hours i still dont get bored! <3 love it to much it hurts",2

"i cant get over this games. two word, explosive barrels",1
"a game where you can do pretty much everything. it has the best minigames to keep you entertained for a long time.",1

"amazing. no other video game has ever sparked my imagination and creativity like this one has.",1
"this seemengly simplistic game ( mod ) is a endless possibility generetor of sorts. dark rp, murder, trouble in terrorist town etc are the modes who ussualy suck in the most of players attention. dark rp imo is without any dought a mode wich truly unique for this game and the fact that you can role play anything or anybody you can imagine is indeed impressive.",1
"probably the most fun game i ever played. its limitless, you can do whatever you want in it, and it has many different gamemodes like trouble in terrorist town, prop hunt, murder, melonbomber, elevator: source, zombie survival and many more which are just awesome! :d you can create things, make them explode, make and kill zombies, kill people and so many other things. its a sandbox game that is one of the best of all!",3

"i played as a cup and flopped around the map while people were shooting at me. 10/10 its ok - ign.",1
"this game has given me hundreds of hours of entertainment and id reccomend it to everyone. this game has a little bit for everyone, from people who want to build something wonderful to people who simply want  around in sandbox mode. the sandbox, however, isnt the best part. the true greatness of this game lies in its ability to be modded, and because of the flexibility of the engine there are thousands of different and unique mods, gamemodes, and addons for this game. this game is cheap and surely give anyone hours of entertainment, which is more than enough justification for anyone to buy this.",2
"it is a great game to play when you want to build a bathtub-car or a nyan cat. you can play online with your friends, and i personally love murder. *****",1
"just absolutely love this game! cant stop playing it. was it worth the money? oh yea!",1
"we need less servers where half the addons you cant use. otherwise i like this game.",1
"funniest game to ever play with friends! every add-on, free. and the add-ons have tornados, jump scares, run or  (the crap?) skins, cheats, hostile and friendly ais, and dinosaurs? as i said earlier, very funny game. and dont worry if you two computers, go to multiplayer then local sever. and have fun!",1
"fun sandbox game personaly i love the ponyliving darkrp severs",4
"$10 is not even close to the value i have gotten out of this game. messing around in sandbox mode with friends, running furiously from the murderer in murder and keeping still on the edge of your seat in prop hunt, the possibilities are literally endless. the beauty of garys mod is that although it is amazing with friends, it is still fun when played alone. dont let not having any friends who play it stop you from buying this amazing game! i would recommend this game, even to the most casual of gamers.",1
"you can cyber other males ingame 10/10 ive been doing this for over 150 hours",1
"this game is the best game i ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

"awesome game!tons of fun! i really recommend the darkrp mod!it is amazing!get a profession and try to be rich and successful,or just be a  and  with people! seriosly,the game is totally worth the money just for this mod! the game itself is awesome,but not really fun on singleplayer!",1
"if you like funny mods and sandbox and awesome mini games and love memes this game is for you",1
"oh. okay. g-garrys mod. alright, lets do this. ...i dont know. its a game that isnt always the same game. thats good..i suppose. that was what i said about this game a year ago. lots have changed. so, i dont enjoy this game anymore. its just getting to the point where its painful to play, due to simple boredom. if you havent played something like it before, great. go get it. but, i cant play it anymore. 1247 hours, man. anyway, recommended it. but, it gets incredibly boring after some time. go team.",3
"you can turn in to a watermelon... what more can you ask for?",1

"i love how everyone who put not reccomended on this game has played it for hundreds of hours! lol like if you hate the game so much why did you play it for hundreds or even thousands of hours? garrys mod is probably one of the best games ever created for creative people who like messing around for countless hours on end. there is no point to this game! nothing you do on this game makes any sense, thats what makes it gmod! if you enjoy games that have no rules and let you do whatever the hell you want this is the game for you!",1
"worth the money, but make sure to buy css: textures.",2
"this game is awsome!! when you try to find multiplayer games there are loads of servers to go on!! u can build whatwver you want and i love it also this is a sandbox game so i recommend this game! 5 out of 5 stars!!",1
"this is game is great, it lets you do pretty much anything!",1
"i have spent countless hours building, destroying, running, driving, and have played on most of the multiplayer gamemodes (ttt, sandbox, prophunt, darkrp, perp, deathrun, murder, melonbomber, flood, hl2 rp, etc. even with all of this, i am still enthralled by all of its fun quirks and abilities. it is constantly updated and being jam packed with cool stuff. i suggest buying cs: source though, as having those textures would be nice/helpful.",2
"i, highly recommend this game to others! this game has so many fun mods, you will never get bored.. if! you play with friends.. its really a game that should be played with (irl/online) friends. youll have a blast screwing eachother over for a good laugh and histerical situations!",1
"does the g in gmod stand for  cuz thats what im thinking. this game blows more dudes than my ex wife and she was a hot dog taste tester. 13/13 this game sucks",1
"one of the best games out there, you can build, create or just mess around, as well as being one of the most customizable and modable games on the market, it also has one of the greatest communities in gaming. i highle reccomend that you buy it.",1
"this game is really fun. you can do anything you want in the game. you can make all sorts of things your heart desires. you can also play gamemodes in multiplayer, there are alot of gamemodes to choose from.you can download addons from the workshop so you can use in the game. you might see tons of youtubers playing this game because its one of the top ten games to choose from the steam store. you can also make your own movies, artwork, and all sorts off stuff you can think of, but before you get garrys mod, you need to bay counter strike source, it helps alot with your textures. if you dont get that game, your textures will look really ugly, but its worth it.",2
"a total mayhem sandbox game of death and chaos. definately worth a look",1
"my   ar always falling thourgh dat floor and it makes the combine  shotgunnar fap his turnip",2
"garrys mod. the game that doesnt have a genre. you could say its a sandbox game, but this game, is anything you want it to be. it can be a fps, racing, building, horror, whatever you want!",1
"garrys mod is a great tool to use to combat your everyday bordeom. and if you havent seen or heard about garrys mod then where have you been? get it! its fun, cheap, and gives much more than what the price tag shows. its a sandbox, go crazy! you never know what you might find, create, or discover in this game.",1
"80% of server owners are 12 year olds who bugged their parents into submission, you can pretend to be their friend and trick them into giving you a lead admin role (takes about 1-2 hours). use this to ban them from their own server. 86/10",2
"this game is amazing, you can do so much. /i suggest buying this with counter strike source and the orange box to get all of the textures.",1
"this game is litterally as it says but more. in garrys mod (gmod), you can either create a world of your own, or join somebodies world. there is a bunch of different game types, like murder, prop hunt, and so on. you can do anything from make a house to being a pop can running from people with grenades and crowbars. if you are into sandbox type games and humorous type games then you wil most likely love this game. -b",1
"my garrys mod often freezes, will not let me back into the game, cant go to task manager, and crashes if i instaled way to many mods. gabe newel if u read this, fix these ing flaws that i have!!!",1

"this game is great fun, there are hundreds of gamemodes within this game. this allows hours and hours of playtime as once you get tired of one gamemode you can just play another more interesting one. you may have already heard of this game from many highly known youtubers such as pewdiepie. the only issue is that this game is not for a truly casual gamer with litlle money to spend. this is because you need other games to be able to get all textues and items within the game. the number one other game you need to fix most problems is: cs:s. if you dont know what that is, then you shouldnt by this game.",2
"one of the most funniest sandbox game. especially with friends :)",1
"i made a train/plane hybrid 11/10 would play again",1

"a game with endless dlc and gamemodes by the hundreds. you cannot buy a better game",2
"with the right gametypes, items, and people to play with, this game becomes more than just a game. it becomes an experience and thats what i love in my games.. something that can make me laugh so damn hard. and the fact that i can blend up a game with items that i choose, leaves it with infinite possibilities. amazing game. (would be nice if i had a simple way to play with my friends only, in a private server)",1
"endless hours of fun! is not a very demanding game, i play on my laptop lol.",1
"its wicked fun. seriously you need to have this game. you feel like and become a god like creature and can wreak up entire freaking cities with guns that shoot exploding pop tarts. how are you not throwing your money at this game???",1

"very fun game for alone making stuff or letting bots fighting eachother. but also very very fun with friends on server i recommend playing with 2 other friends a dark rp server and making your own base i had allot of fun but only if those 11 year old admins would be a little smarter it would be more fun!",1

"im playing it little because ill get stupid but ill not miss the whole damn fun that is going on",1
"there are endless possibilities when you play garrys mod. ill be honest, i didnt even remotely like it at first because of the complexity of setting things up, using downloads, etc. but once i started playing with some friends, i learned how to play things and run games via hamachi, and i begun to love the game. we play games like prop hunt and murder mostly. we also use addons like wac aircraft, which i recommend you get if you enjoy planes and helicopters and flying. this is a great game to play and a tremendous value if you get it for two dollars like i did. also a great game to play if you want to take a break from another game or youre bored. overall i highly recommend this game.",1
"have you ever wished that there was a game in which it was possible to do pretty much absolutely everything? look no further than garry newmans half-life 2 sandbox modification (gmod to you uneducated folk). you can stand on your head with a rocket launcher attached to your kneecap while blowing up a painting of a couch that is sitting on top of a coffee cup made out of wooden toy cars, and that is one of the simplest things you can do. 10/10 easily. great job, garry.",5

"very addicting! this game is for all people, no matter whta you want to do, this game is capable of giving what you want. if you want to hunt for hidden people disguised as objects, this is for you. (prop hunt.) if you wish to roleplay as a variety of characters in emersive areas. (roleplay [clockwork]) if you wish to stand along with traitors, unaware who wants to kill you.

"in this game, youre a sentient potted plant/soda can/chair etc. and you have to hide from a bunch of insane people smashing object around numerous maps... well, thats one of the games. the other ones are pretty fun too!",1
"you can do anything you want at this game.. you can spawn any video game character and fight him with any gun you want. you can create awesome maps and gamemodes .. and the game is very cheap !",1
"best sandbox game ever. but it crashes on some servers. but its a freat game",1
"gmod is a very fun and freeplay type of game. making servers and creating games is plenty fun and being able to do whatever you want really increases the fun on it. it has such an open variety of things you can create and play around with for nonstop entertainment. which is very enjoyable. i love this game and i would reccomend it to anyone.",1
"i recommend this game only for the creative types. if you love building sandcastles and playing minecraft, this is for you.",1
"pretty fun game i like because its like a game where you can do whatever you want",1
"with so many gamemodes and physics tools, this sandbox game is excellent value for money at the price. roleplay servers are popular, things like cops and robbers, half-life 2 roleplay, and build mode servers. if its on sale, pick it up, but keep in mind that the gameplay you get out is completely reliant on what you put in. this isnt a guided experience, this is creativity, and improvisationally based stuff.",5

"totally funny its very worth buying, but sometimes it took a bit to download add-ons to enter server",1
"this game is not fun at all if you play alone. and unfortunately my connection is so poor that i can only either play alone, or wait some hours downloading all these mods before joining another game. man oh man. but i hear you can do a lot of things in this game. and it does seem so. attaching rockets to a bunch of g-men and watch them fly is really funny. so yeah, recommended. + everyones favorite sandbox + workshop + do anything - too many mods - lack of tutorial 7 out of 10, good.",1
"this game is cheap and fun. i reccomend you buy it.",1
"a sandbox game that has me coming back for more even when games such as gta v compete with it, definitely worth buying.",3

"1 of the best games i ever played i will play more for sure",1
"this is an awesome game! there is so much to do and its a great laugh when playing with friends, this is a must have!",1

"you can make two ragdolls  eachother. 10/10 best game.",2
"i went into this world and thought im hungry so i cooked up a scout and ate him 10/10",1
"an amazing game. truly the first game with infinite free dlc. with millions of maps and plenty of gamemodes, its a win.",1
"this is one of my most favourite games of al time. it is very fun and mods (addons) are so easy to get.",1
"anybody who is in to pc gaming should have this game. 10/10",2
"with a little imagination you can have endless enjoyment. this is a must for anyone that owns half life 2, counter strike: source, and team fortress 2. its also a good first step for those that have ever been interested in modding. it includes a large amount of suprisingly fun spin-off mods that are powered by a community with no sign of winding down. quite the opposite, it seems more people are playing.",1
"funny sandbox fun its just gmod buy it nowwwwww!!!!!!!!",1
"its the best to just go around in ttt shooting people......and then getting banned.... but its still fun",1
"hey guys. you must get this game if you havent already. if you have..... stop being clevaaaaar!!!!",3

"i can tell im going to waste many, many hours, or even years of my life playing gmod, and ill love every minute of it, this game gives you freedom to do a lot of stuff, check out my profile for some wacky screenshots i posted, you can basically have custom everything, from game modes to player models, to props, weapons, and even friendly and evil npcs, i truly love this game and highly recommend it",1
"10% shooting plebs in the face 90% downloading server content packs why the  did i play so much of this edit: i figured id add a little more, ive been playing this game for a few years now and holy  i didnt think a community could become so horrible, brought on by an ensemble of  youtube letsplayers you get to enjoy incompetent admins and their suckup 12 year old fanbase criticise you for doing anything that relates to being fun. its hardly even a game at this point",5
"if you dont have it get it. now. you will first start a new game and not understand a thing, probably spawn some crap and fling it about. they are two things you will do at this point, you will quit or you will waste your life on it. the people who did the latter of the options explored the many different gamemodes and servers on it (that almost appear hidden to new players) and found one they liked. the people who play for ages probably found a online community based around one or more of the game modes. the people who quit played single play sandbox or tried a single server. if you explore it watch as your life disapears and this game takes up your life.",3
"the most fantastic thing that is on the internet. it is what it isnt, and also what it is. the price on this tanks during sales, so id recommend it.",1
"this game is completely terrible for roleplaying. roleplaying should be removed from the game mode list completely. server hosts do not admin properly (i.e making everyone follow the rules that they set when a guest enters a game.) if you give money to the server hosts then you can fun with the game but if you dont then you are going to have an awful experience that will make you want to quit playing the game completely. yes there are other game modes which are fun but i dont want to kill zombies or other players all the time. this game used to be fun but i can never enjoy the game because of the server hosts. i do not recommend this to anyone looking to have fun time but not killing other players. 2/10",1
"best game ever for beginning gamers. easy to play and learn, even killing yourself is fun in this game. you can find creative ways to do anything. you can play as anyone, whether it be mario or pacman. you can do it.",3
"considering i have almost 1000 hours played on gmod, i think it is safe to say that this game is fantastic! it is by far my most played game. this game is so great because there are so many gamemodes. if you get bored of one then just play another!",4
"a really fun game, you can get alot out of hours out of this game easily.",1
"there are days you want to rip your head off while playing this game. if your doing that, your playing it right. why would i buy a game i dont recommend?",1
"this is a fun sanbox game, where anything is possible. if you dont like certain things, you can do the things you want! endless possibilities.",2
"**quick warning, this game is much more enjoyable if you buy it with the counter-strike: source pack. you want as many source games as possible when playing this because it borrows models. this game is downright awesome. there are many modes from playing as a traitor and trying to blend in with the civilians waiting to kill them to playing a jail warden commanding the prisoners to follow your orders lest they rebel.",1
"very addicting. extremely fun, funny, awesome and really a whole lot more to do",1
"a very recommended game that is cheap and a lot of fun.",1
"right...garrys mod is one of the best games ever. there is no such thing of something you cant do in this game. if you like to play with your friends or make funny things,this is the game for you. 11/10 ign would put heavy on the toilet again",1

"make sure to play this game with friends and you will enjoy it more than 100 hours!",1
"this game is an over-the-top-game-in-your-face-palooza. tired of creating things in sandbox? go kill people in trouble in terrorist town. tired of killing others and being killed? try out prop hunt, the ultimate hide and seek. tired of that? you play too much. fine, try deathrun or rp or any of the other 200 or so game modes. if you somehow become bored with everything, then look to the workshop for mods and skins. trust me, this game should cost three times as much for all the games it contains. plus, whenever gmod updates, guess what, new gamemodes!!! this is totally worth it. see you in there.",2
"this game is awesome! get it before the offer runs out!!! :s",1
"do whatever you want with anything you want for as long as you want as much as you want.",2

"this is absolutely, hands down the best game that i have ever purchased. i play constantly and love all the different things you can do in in. what i am amazed by is how cheap this game is and it is just packed w/ loads of fun!",3
"this game has more balls to the walls action than a micheal bay film, and thats saying something.",1
"do you like garrys mod? then you should buy this. do you not like garrys mod, then you should buy this.",2
"you dont run out of things to do, tired of sandbox? go play some ttt. dont like having trust issues? then go play prop hunt. you will always have something to do on here, definetly worth the $10",2
"its great! one of the best, most popular sandbox games ever! -great sandbox -great mods -great customization -for only 9.99 -why are you looking at this review just buy it already!!!!!",1
"this is my absolute favorite game on steam.other than this being a build anything type of game, there are many different gamemodes to try. the only annoying thing about this game is the fact that you need other games to see *some* textures. (but there are loopholes to that.) a cheap game, that has great quality, and many possibilities.",2
"makes me want to hit a shoe on my head and shove a remote up my butt on the loading screens.",1
"i have spent hundreds of hours playing this game i highly recommend it!",2
"this game is ing great, all the gamemodes, mods, etc, just make this game! and no, that isnt bad, thats the point of this game, its more of a base for a  ton of mods.",3
"these are things that you will see in garrys mod: + everything.",1
"great game, a must have! many game-modes to play and enjoy, all very different from one another.",1
"this game is freaking annoying. each time you join a game you have to download 9001 files and when you get in the game it has purple crap everywhere if the files did not download properly.when you actually get in the game it can be fun ,but not worth sitting and downloading files for half an hour is it.",1
"best game to mess around on with your friends. the mod suport keeps the game fresh every day.",1
"most certainly a must-own title for any casual pc gamer or steam user. definitely a classic indie game among many others. this game can easily provide hours of entertainment to those of nearly all ages with or without friends!",1
"shot joel in head, blood came out, didnt die.  game 0/10.",3
"this game, possibilities are endless, i mean come on guys i welded a chair to an icbm and rode it across a map, if that doesnt sound fun you must not enjoy being random like i do",2
"this is a very good game. i wish servers were easyer to set up for just playing with friends but whatver. its kinda  that you need css to get some textures making ttt impossible to play. but still 10 bucks is worth the price",1

"very good game, lots of fun game types within the game, shame about needing to have cs:s but still very fun.",2
"this is absolutely fun and its not a game its your world of imagination.",1
"i am sorry peeps. i just dont like this game. you need half life 2 ans counterstrike source to see all the textures. some of the servers in garrys mod just use those textures and i dont want to pay $10 to $25 just so i can get this game working fully. something else i hate about the game is it eats away at your computer just so it can run properly. now my minecraft, battlefield, dont starve, arma 3, the walking dead and league of legends lag soo much. i have uninstalled garrys mod and it is still trying to uninstall it for about 10 minutes now. i rate this game a 3/10",1
"i love it! best of the best definetly. garrys mod puts the phys in physics. anyone who isnt sure about this game, it is definetly worth your while.",5

"this is one of the best games i have played and is worth paying 10 dollers. it fun becouse you can do almost anything and can be creative.",1
"this game is freakin amazing i would recomend you buy this game its worth the money i promise",1
"one of the best games on steam. while not all the content is there, considering a lot of it is through counter-strike, it still has a plethora of stuff from hl2, except that you can do whatever you want. want to make g-man for half life pick his nose while the entire cast of left 4 dead watches? go ahead! there are also a lot of servers, though most of them do require counter-strike. overall: some of the best times youll have are on darkrp. (one of the many online gamemodes) youll need cs:s to enjoy most of the online servers. you can basically do whatever you want in both offline single-player, and online multiplayer.",1
"its a brilliant game tonnes of things to do omg so awsomwe",1
"good for creating, animating, and doing whatever the f*** you want",1
"garrys mod is a physics sandbox. there arent any predefined aims or goals. they give you the tools and leave you to play. you spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether thats a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesnt have a name yet - thats up to you. you can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day. if youre not too great at construction - dont worry! you can place a variety of characters in silly positions. but if you want to do more, facepunch studios have the means. you have no life to scroll down so low.",1
"hey uhh... no pressure but you better buy gmod if you want your dog back. alive",4
"honestly this game is the best, make whatever you want!  yea! :) ttt and rp are awesome",1
"fun, game, love the many different game-modes you can create. 8.5/10",1
"i cant rate this game enough!i have so much fun on this game every time i play and there is so much you can do and so many possibilities.its a game for creativity and so much more!",1
"awsome game best sandbox game in the world just buy it and play it you might need counter strike : source for the textures but fun as heck",3
"an amazing game that can tune to the way you want to play it. a definite buy.",1
"really good game but every now and again the game wont let you start the sandbox mode, its basically crashes everytime you try to do it, but dont let that push you away from the game its really good and there are a good variety of gamemodes",1
"if i were locked in a room for the rest of my life, these are the following things required to live that i would need. food, water, family, and garrys mod.",2
"a fun multiplayer sandbox game. grab it and play it with friends! :)",1

"joined murder server. became murderer. but i didnt want to hurt anyone so i decided to go with my fellow bystanders peacefully, but after while i started to fart black smoke and got shot. go try, its fun.",1
"i love this game, theres a lot of stuff you can do. but by the game with counter-strike source its better :p",1
"you want to be something unimaginable, something impossible, something you wont get not even once, but you want it to be happen. this is the answer. 69/10",1
"its awsome to play with friends and just build stuff or play one of the awsome game modes i highly recomend",1
"i cant join any servers! the only thing people can do is wait and nobody can figure out the problem. they blame it on the firewall but that is not the problemi looked up on steam and other websites on bug like this and the problem has not been solved.",1
"i downloaded garrys mod with the intention of becoming a pokemon master. i was going to grab lots of little pokemon from their stupid idiot library and place them all over the map and then i was going to live with them and it was going to be amazing. of course instead of that happening i apparently have to deal with pokemon souls or something because all i was able to do was create a city littered with little pokemon corpses. all of my pokemon were dead immediately and thats something i dont know how to deal with so i shut the game off and left my house and never came back. i dont think its ethical to make pokemon bodies but leave their souls for what i can only assume will be an expansion pack. 10/10",1
"wanna go to the cinema but cant afford? get this game wanna murder people with a knife? get this game wanna murder people with a gun? get this game? dont have friends in real life and wanna play a roleplay? get this game wanna play horror games and get scared by a tar covered zombie? get this game wanna build stuff? get this game wanna play hide and seek but dont have friends? get this game wanna transform into objects and get hunted down? get this game wanna race as a melon? get this game 10 of 10, i recommend this game",1
"an amazing game. truly the first game with infinite free dlc. with millions of maps and plenty of gamemodes, its a win.",1
"really funny game, build anything you want and download some awesome addons and its perfect",1
"this game is the most amazing thing created by god! just need to come up with its own textures so you dont have to spend over $200. but really its the best thing to play as long as you have a dedicated server to play on, then youre good.",3
"i love this game so much cause the possiblities are endless.",5
"considering all the addons its kind of like every game combined! if you want a game that is random, a sandbox, and just a game that will give you a good time with your friends, then this is the game for you! you dont need advanced computer specs and gmod costs only 10 bucks! (sometimes that price is decreased very much during sales!)",1
"a bag of doritos driving a lamborghini through minecraft, great",1
"great game if youre bored and want to have some fun!",1
"i cant wait to download 100+ addons from workshop just to play for 5 minutes!",1
"its a great game with a addon for pretty much everything you could want. it does take quite a bit of getting used to the controls though, so that does make it a little harder. if there was less blood im pretty sure more people would be allowed to play it but i think its fine like that. i wish the pannel to spawn items was easier to navigate and it would be cool if you could make your own folders to sort things into so you know where everything is. other then that, it is a great game and i would recommend it to anyone 10+ also, the fact that you cant remove the dead bodies of the npcs gets kind of annoying... anyway i give this game a 8/10 for a great game thats a little confusing.",1
"this game is like a non survial minecraft. amybody that has steam should get gmod",1
"900 hours and counting... $10! now that my friends is value for money! a fun open world sandbox game utilizing valves source engine, your mind is the limit in this game. i would highly recommend this game for its great value for money and thriving community!",2

"dis es such a gud gaym if yuo dnot leik et yuo r obviously mentally disabled or blaek.",3
"good game, alot of creativity. alot of fun with the addons. i reccomend it to anyone that likes sandbox games. :)",3
"how do i describe wat you do in this game... you can kill, hide, betray, and just goof around all at the same time in this wacky game. this is by far the best party game for a lan party or just to hang out with friends playing this. it has a great communitiy, plenty of amazing game modes. youll soon find yourself addicted to go hide as a prop, or go be sneaky as a traitor, or go blow some people up with some melons. hope to see you in the game!",1
"great game. you can sink hundreds of hours into this game and still have more things to do. ive played this game quite a bit and i still find myself coming back to it only to find new and fun things. on top of all that, the built in toybox adds countless of fun usermade doo-dads to mess around with.",3
"ragdolls, ridiculous workshop addons, what more could you want?",1
"probobly one of the best games i have ever played in my life",1
"possibly the most fun i had on a computer. garrys mod is limitless. if you think of something in your mind you can make it. with new addons every week it is fun alone or with friends. however only one thing bothers me, you need textures from other games but thats the only problem. i sugest getting the bundle with css, more textures.",2
"really fun to play single player or multiplayer, messing around in single player has been the solution to my boredom every time. the gmod community is great, and the add ons people make are unbelievable.",1
"its awesome to make lets plays and play with friends.(good price)",1
"it is a great game. it makes the game better if you play with friends. i would of payed so much more money for this game.",1

"from what i have played, it seems like fun. havent logged as much as id like though.",2
"ayyyy... this game makes me dream about cheese sometimes so dats a plus, but other times theres weeaboos. garrys mod is a sandbox game that teaches children about the importance of fan fiction. no matter how salty it may be, theyre all dank. slapping people is fun. sleep deprivation is a giant plus. 8/8 would r8 again no b8 m8. theres also superb memes from the tips of mens fedoras.",2

"this game is great fun on its own, but the thing that makes it amazing is the multiplayer gamemodes; ttt, dark rp, ect. if you love building , playing around with your friends, or anything really (its probably on the workshop) then get this game.",1
"garrys mod(gmod) is a fun sandbox game that lets you explore near infinite possibilities for creation. however the game is most fun when you are playing with friends, the game modes are fun but only for a little while before you get tired of obnoxious microphone spamming and people stabbing you in the back. i rate this game on a scale of 1 to 10 a 6.5 an above average game but just barely.",1

"best sandbox game ever ! you can play alone or with friends. you can create everything you want like cars , boat etc and this game have gamemodes. one of my favourite is trouble in terrorist town where you must find the traitor (as innocent and detective) and kill all terrorist (as traitor indeed) well nice game after all 8.5/10",1

"garrys mod is pretty undescribeable but ill do my best its basically a game in which you are given the ability to entertain yourself any way you wish and the beuty of it is that if something you want isnt in the game you can make it i have spent hours (as it shows above) on this game and can definately say it has what alot of games dont. the players full imagination as the driving force to play the game.",1
"i am truly honored to play such a great sandbox game.",1

"ah, garrys mod. what else can be said about this beauty of a game that hasnt already been said before? whoever had the idea to take half life, team fortress 2, and every other valve source-based game and packing it into a cheap little package is one brilliant guy. this game offers an endless amount of playtime, given the vast amount of gamemodes. hell, you could get hundreds of hours out of a single mode. dont feel like building crazy stuff in sandbox? then hop on over to trouble in terrorist town. had enough of murdering your fellow terrorists? prop hunts always a blast to play. the community is where this game shines, creating some truly amazing addons to the game. if you dont have this game already, get it. i guarentee you wont be disappointed.",1

"pretty fun, but make sure you have cs:s, hl2 and its elisodes otherwise youll have missing textures. and missing textures make baby cthulhu cry.",1
"freedom is garrys mod motto. there is so much to do from a fantastic community that keeps growing. go accuse your friends of terrorism or build a double ended  machine for alex; did i mention there is a lot of freedom?",1

"pretty cool you can spawn anything from halflife and also team fortress. the best bit is other users can create maps mods and anything you want, to download from the work shop. guns, npcs, cars the possibilte are endless but still buggy. i am running garrysmod on a 2012 mac and with new mods every day it gets laggier every day. 8/10",1
"if i deleted all my addons i would clear 11 gb off my hard drive... if",1
"literally the best game to mess around with some friends. 10/10 would play everyday",2
"i highly recommend this game, due to its great multiplayer, hilarious physics, and decent graphics. it is fun to play singleplayer, but even more fun to play multiplayer. the only downside to multiplayer is the server restrictions. some servers have huge restrictions that make the server boring and no fun to play on, while other servers allow you to do whatever you please. another reason i recommend this game is the mods. mods dont ruin the fun like mods in some other games. but instead, the mods enhance the singleplayer, and multiplayer if the server owner is running them. overall, if i were to give this game a rating, it would be an 8.5/10. the game is really enjoyable.",1
"it used to be fun game. now its trolls and bad babies with admin and bad server owners. abuse all over this game. garry himself even helped ruin the game. i do not recommend this game to anybody.",4
"i told my friend i wasnt the murderer... then i stabbed him and watched his body fly across the room. the next day i hid myself as a barel. no one found me. but enough about me. garrys mod. quite good fun indeed. 10/10",1

"garrys mod is a great game and it can get in touch with a creative side of people like when making various stuff like cars catapolts etc",1
"this game is the best game i ever bought and i bought alot of games. if you got the money for the game now and you and thinking about getting it, stop thinking and get it now. its just plain auwsome !!!",2
"fun, awesome sandbox game, with awesome gamemodes like ttt, prop hunt and more! this is a must have! 9/10 could be better then what it is right now.",2
"a game where players can use their knowledge of programming to make games. a game where the only limits are the engine. a game for everyone.",3
"garrys mod is a great game. there are many things you can do with just random old junk. you can build an airplane that can fly into sky, you can build a car, that has a giant party house over it, you can make anything. if you are bored of limited tools or props, there are tons of addons that can help your imagination spread.",1
"got mugged by a 5 year old child. then told to watch gay russian porn on garrys mod cinema. then screamed at by a twelve year old on deathrun and bhop. still havent played the game that much, 9.8/5 approved by 12 year olds",3
"if you dont have counter strike source dont buy it! if you do its fun its 1000 in one",1
"its one of my faorite games if you get bourd of sandbox try an other game type on line",1
"this is pretty much a must buy for most owners of valve/source engine games, so if you dont already have it, this is what you can expect: garrys mod is essentially a sandbox providing physics, posing, and props from any source engine game you own. its what is used to make a lot of machinimas. there is also lua scripting and a whole lot of usermade mods, so there are a few usermade gamemodes. expect to have bought cs:s as a lot of everything uses those models, and expect to have friends to do crazy things with for hours in a giant sandbox enviornment to maximize enjoyment.",1
"you have to buy counter strike source to play on most multiplayer servers without tons of errors but its fun with friends",1
"i recommend this game because the servers are just pure banta",2
"10/10 one of the best games ever since the birth of christ imo.",1
"i would really recommend this game to anyone that loves any kind of game. i say that because you can do anything in this game from building things to playing gmod slender with other people. its really a great game.",1
"based on source engine, garrys mod is tool with you can play whatever comes to mind of players.",1
"epic ragdoll and editing game mess around with ragdolls and just have fun with ragdolling",2

"great game to just mess around with your friends. it may get boring from time to time, but thats why theres workshop add-ons! enjoy! 10/10",1
"make a video? make a car? you can do everything in gmod! :d",1
"this is an extremely fun game for people that like modding and building. you will get lots of hours of entertainment from this game.",1
"higly recommendet by anyone ho loves creating and building stuff",3
"this game is awsome intertainment. helps a fellow when hes bored and is grate whit freinds :) i love this game and so will you. ore elese the grimm will coome for you :*",1
"to call this a game as such would be somewhat untrue. its more like a toybox. garrys mod gives you all the tools but you need to use them: build a giant robot, make a machinima or just spawn a bunch of enemies and go nuts. very few games have such freedom. if you desire freedom and nothing else, pick this up right away.",1
"a game (while in fact this is hl2s mod) where you can do anything you want, spawn anything random and mess up with everything in the game? this game is the place. no storyline, only you and your brain who can mess the area or maybe making an epic scene from props and ragdolls ingame. dont worry, not only that kind of gamemode that available in this game, theres around hundreds of gamemode available in the game, ranging from hunting a terrorist traitor, hunting a living prop, and many more! :v",1
"this is one of the best games i have ever played. if you have friends that you dont hate this is the perfect game for you. from ttt to prop hunt this game is the best. of course there is sandbox mode which is halo forge mode but on alot of drugs because it just blows everything elese out of the water with its endless possibilitys. the amount of creativity is insane with all the differant ideas people por out. just trust me if you play the game right you wont want to stop. just look at how much hours people put in. dont wait just buy it. ps if money is a problem wait till black friday they always have it on sail and dont forget to get cs source or the game bugs out. thanks for reading",1
"this is one of the best games on steam. there is soooo much to do, and you can do whatever you want. despite the graphics downsides, there are more maps that do not take outside games than do.",1
"very funny in so many ways but i like to mess around with the tf2 chars and the five nights at freddys things too! i recommend this game to people who love to laugh about game things like for sample heavy from tf2 having his eyes on the sandvich and no i didnt spell sandwich wrong thats how its spelled in the game",1
"this game is real fun to play around in just wish you didnt need to by counter strike source",1
"garrys mod is an outstandingly fun physics sandbox that has the potential to be a lone standing game... but sadly, youll have to get half life 2, counter strike source, tf2 (optional), and a bunch of other add on packages... good luck with that.",2
"what is this garrys mod you speak of? all i see is trouble in terrorist town, murder, prophunt and darkrp. and that thing called sandbox that nobody uses...",2
"entered a sandbox server full of kids, spawned a zombie that jumped to the kids face, kid screamed so hard. game gave me a good laugh, but it costed me my ears. 10/10 would spawn again, though.",1
"my life disintegrated when i bought this game. ... 10/10.",2
"this is a really awesome sandbox game and it was worth the money i think!",2
"this game kept me rolling for a good long while as i saved for a good pc so i could play better games.",1
"ivew enjoyed thousands of hours on this game its great for 10$ lol its great",5
"this game is great come to deadeye gaming its the best server check it out!",2
"its great, you can do and build anything but you will need mods and sometimes they create script errors but it is a really fun game",1
"the possibilities are endless, especially with friends. :) dont buy it without cs:s.",2
"this  wont install wtf!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"get it play online build stuff it rocks i will say it now ahhhhhhhhh it rocks i make my own carrs you can make jetpacks even planes and you can get epic addons.",1
"this game it hours and hours of fun with all its different games and add-ons.",1
"wow dis game let u maek alot of toys and bathtubs wow, every1 buy cuz it is best game because u can fly and maek stuff wow",1
"i wish it was free because i really want it and i dnt have money!",1
"so thats how chuck norris dies... 11/10 would nuke again",2
"man! this game has got to be my most favourite game of all time (you can probably tell from the amount of hours played :d). it is my most favourite game because it is extensive and fun because of the amount of content it provides. this content includes downloadable maps, weapons, vehicles and more from the in - game workshop and plentiful servers to play on. i would definitely recommend it to any that is thinking of getting it because it is worth your time and your money.",3
"i bought a game with mod in the name i cant believe myself i rate myself 0/10 = not kevin bacon",1
"+fun and crazy game to mess around with, let your imagination go crazy and still be able to shoot and kill people. -sometimes abit glitchy and requires counterstrike source and team fortress 2 to play on some maps comfortably. -need alot of mods to play many other game modes and the animation/graphics could have been done better and more smooth",1
"the limits of fun this game offers has no limits!!! highly recommend it.",1
"you should definitely play that game! sooooooo much fun! it is filled with mods and games and theres no time to get bored!",1
"the best game in general. playing with friends in a world where anything is possible can create some of the most unimaginable things, whether its simply posing a ragdoll to form humanities abomination, or creating an amazing map, garrys mod has it all. if you have no one to play with, singleplayer sandbox is the way to go. the addons will keep you occupied and the possibilities in the open-world sandbox is endless, playing alone never felt so good. totally recommend this, invest in the full ver. its worth it.",1
"i love this game! so much time spent playing, and so many videos created in this game. awesome sandbox! :)",1
"this game is really incredible. when i see some gameplay on it on youtube, it look funny but when you play it you cant stop laughing this game have also a big community who making mod on workshop so youll never get bored of this",2
"its lags but there is so much stuff you can get stuff like faith from mirrors egde!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!extreamly good so i recomend it to all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"i think this is a great game if you like to build crap with your friends, shoot random poeple and troll little 6 year olds :ddddddd gives teh lrod of teh watermelon give gmod a 9/10 (not a 10 because h8rs gonna h8)",1
"this half life 2 parody is a brilliant game which allows you to do anything you want with the tools/npc/props/weapons/buildings so buy it now for your own half life 2 sandbox!!!!! :d",1
"garrys mod was the game that i realy wanted to play when i was like 12 years old. i loved this game due to the creative building, maps, addons and mostly multiplayer. this game already hits an apple. - stevenisadork",1
"its amazing when you know what servers to go to, find out what game modes you like, and what you can make with all the addons. the possibilities are endless. (note: if you have a sucky computer, addware, ect. your expirience will be diffrent until you fix all your problems)",3
"sexiest game ever made this game is a really good game i reccomend this game to ppl who like top play roleplay servers and build what they want if you lik any of that check this game out",3
"quite a fun, creative game. good if youre very imaginitive and want to create something new. or if you want to have fun with friends and mess around on a server. or if you want to basically create your own game with customizable maps, enemies and weapons. a great experience. 9/10",1
"10/10 tons of fun. cant stop playing. get some friends and play with them and it will be 10 times more fun. one of the best and most fun games i will ever own in my steam library. i definately reccomend this game to everyone. its great for whatever you are into. this is a must have game. if you dont have it now, do me a favor and get it for yourself. you will be glad you did.",2
"awesome game, great for rp and stupid other games, realy fun",1
"i made heavy take a crap on spy while getting raeped by scout, as pyro shoves his flamethrower up g-mans . worth it",1
"good for building. great for server fun. not so good for friendships. 8/10",1
"i do like the stuff in garrys mod, but it is really broken for me. a lot of textures just do not load, showing error signs, or other strange texture glitches. i see people on the internet have no problem like this, which worries my, because i got a new computer. i will reccomend it because it works for everyone else.",1
"pretty much the star game of steam. you can do anything and more in this game.",1
"garry mods is a awesome game once you know what youre doing at the start of it you will not what do at all or what type of game it is and that is fine you will soon get the hang of it and you should love it!!!!",5
"garrys mod is one of the best sandbox games ever. it runs fine as well, untill you add mods. you can go ahead and add a few mods, but the more mods you add, the more of a chance of you breaking your pc. i played the game for a long time and had tons of mods. the game would crash alout, and then the worst of the worst happened. the game crashed and i was forced to shut off the computer the wrong way, by pressing the button that turns it on. when i turned it back on the next day, i had the allmighty blue screen of death. this game almost completly destroyed my pc. i suggest to do get this game, just dont get any mods. i suggest you get 2 or 3 gamemodes and then stop. if you dont want to destroy your pc, then dont get any mods.",1
"this game is a fun way to waste hours of your day. you will be hooked. the best part is, you can spawn all the bath tubs you want! 10/10",2

"this game never gets old! you got stop it slender!, prop hunt and the like! always fun to play!",1

"amazing game, amazing gamemodes, the most fun ive had. i recommend playing with 2-4 friends. make sure to get cs:source or you will mainly see black and purple textures. try out a sandbox server called ttt-fun (im not a mod or anything i just really love the server) and............ you can spawn........ mellons! 10/10 -kewl",1
"this game is very clever in my opinion because its a mod thats designed to make mods and be moded, i have has hours of fun out of this game, the amount of things that you can download. you will never get bored of this game, the amount of things that you can do is just endless and even if your not keen on others mods or game modes you can make your own fun and play it with your friends which i think is truly fabulous!",1
"this is a physics sandbox game where you can build anything you want... literaly. you can build a castle, a car, and pretty much anything else. i reccomend this game to e-v-e-r-y-o-n-e. plus it doesnt cost that much",2
"when i first bought this, my friend said not a game, bro. he was right. its not a game. it is your world. do with it what you wish.",1
"garrys mod is a sandbox game which revolves around mods and the modding community. what kind of mods you ask? gamemodes, weapons, maps, vehicles, npcs, tools, effects, player models, server content and more! better yet, the game goes really cheap (2.49 usually) during sales so pick it up then, but i personally got it in a pack with counter strike but do whatever you want. tl:dr great game go buy it",1
"this is the best creative gam apart from minecraft!!you can download items and tools and maps ect from the addon section and use them! its a game wwere if u wanna make a killer heavy or a sled or a plane if u know how then you can !!!!!!!!!!! get it if u wanna have a good time :)",1
"-what is that game, dad? -the future, son. edit: narator: - the dad died after 3 months playing garrys mod.",1
"an absolute phenomenom of a game. snatches your time into its gripping claws and makes damn sure you come back for more. while playing the various community made multiplayer modes (i would recommend darkrp or trouble in terrorist town), you will find no more amount of fun can be had when playing with friends. an flawless masterpiece, thanks to the community that makes it so lively and enables it to provide you with endless hours of entertainment.",1
"play this game when you arent in the mood. this game brings you to dream land where you can use mods. i rate this game 10/10",1
"a very good game. the community is amazing with varied mods, servers and game modes, that help keep gameplay fresh.",1

"awesome game, fun to play around in singleplayer and messing with addons. worth buying. ^_^",1
"a great game to play with your friends. you can do pretty much anything in there which makes it even more fun. that being said, there are loads of different mods to choose from, so everyone is able to find something to play here. you dont really see how time passes while playing this game, so thats another plus when trying to kill time on your own.",1
"one of the best possible released games in the history of forever. 11/10",1
"this game was probebly the best sandbox game i have ever had the honor to play, it has unmatched scripting, epic ragdoll poseing, perfect for thoese days you just want to be wacky and it also can have a epic side in which you make awesome screen shots of some random character owning everyone..... put short : if you want a game that you can basiclly do anything this is the game for you. my rating for this game = 10/10 nice job valve.",1
"so the main thing about gaymod is that there are terrorists and they always ing kill me first why cant i ever be a traitor and theres so many rdmers its not even fun i hate it, but thats just trouble in terrorist town, or as i like to call it, trouble in gayorisst town. and then theres dark rp, which is super gay. people run around as my little pony characters and theres always onw person who exclaims that he wants to kum inside rainbow dash, and its so ing gay i hate it please dont buy this game it is literally the worst its even worse than minecraft which is saying a lot",1

"i think that it is impiled that if you have steam you have garys mod",1
"there is no way that you can truly dislike garrys mod. since the game is mostly based off of the steam workshop, it can be whatever you make of it. the possibilities are endless in gmod, so i highly suggest this game. like every game though, the somewhat childish community is the only negative.",1
"garrys mod has mods. and its better then cod. you can spawn a pod. and i dont know what else that rhymes with mod......gud game!",2

"perfect game; easy to install addons and do what ever the hell you like",1
"this game is fun game you can do what ever you like by your self or with friends. this game is fun because of the mods you use in the game. and the gamemodes you use in this game like prop hunt, murder, trouble in terrorist town and sand box. and i recommend this game for people who like to have fun!",1
"this game it is amazing because you can do what ever you want and there are really cool servers like sled build,flood,shooting,zombies and even rps on your fav. games such as half life 2 role play and real life rp this game is worth the 10 bucks but i have one big complant i cant play this game any more it is blocked it was worth the 10 bucks for the 6 months i had it but now i cant play =/ does have some virus or what if you have any answers please contact me thourgh my profile",2
"really fun! try to find a good server and enjoy the gamemodes in the amazing mod!",1
"dont buy this unless you like to stare at your screen for hours. tons on user created content, what more is one to ask for!?",1
"a massive sandbox game to  around with people in. possibilties are mostly endless other than the outdated graphics this game is fabu!",2
"this is a great game and the best part about it is that you can use all the models from other games that run on the source engine if you own them.",1
"made the tellitubbies fight a trex while spawning deadpools around them to watch. 10/10 tellitubbies win...",3
"awesome when i first heard of this i was curious and it is way to fun to ignore!!!!!!!!!!",1
"had this game for around 3 years now, one of my first games, it still lives up to this day. garrys mod is like a sandbox game, where you can pretty much make anything. people have made there own custom stuff like maps, and guns, for it too, which adds lots of variety when you play as well. the user interface and menus are layed out nice and simplistic too, which i like a lot. its so easy to learn, that infact ive come across lots of younger kids on it as well. its simple, yet advanced and complex at the same time. really fun to pick up on and youll find yourself addicted, playing for hours at a time, get this game you have to try it. this game is exotic. 9/10",1
"my friend killed me with a  10/10 best game ever xd",1
"awesome game to mess around. 100x times better if you play with friends. a must buy",1
"totally worth it. endless possibilities and gamemodes",5
"+many gamemodes +lots of fun +heaps of content +let your imagination run wild -particular communities can be less than inviting -steep learning curve for sandbox mode note: to get the most out of garrys mod, you will need counter-strike source. otherwise many character models and textures show up as big error signs and pink/black checkered boxes, respectively. its also good to have other source games but css is almost essential.",1
"this game is one of my favorites. sandbox-type games are my favorite, and this one tops my list. there are so many different things to do. and with the steam workshop, and the massive amount of user-created content makes the possibilites endless!",1
"a good game to get if youre a modder, like using source mods, or just want to just screw around. ton of mods in the workshop for it too, giving you access to many npcs, models (inanimate objects) and weapons, amoung many other things. it is, however, better if you own half life 2 and some source games (not just tf2, things like cs: source, or day of defeat:source). these allow for more maps and models to use, (though if you just want to screw around, you may well just get a source game). also fun to use soucre mods, like trouble in terrorist town or zombie panic (games you can load in gmod). its good fun, but even more fun with friends. good to test new mods/custom sweps with as well.",1
"really fun game evan online i highly recommend this game",1
"this game is by far the most random game i have ever played! xd",1
"you! i already bought this danm game! wtf kill yourself!",1
"8/10 pros: over 63,000 different types of items to spawn guaranteed over 200 hours of playtime. different types of custom addons to download and use ability to create cars, buildings, etc. cons: bad optimization tons of bugs. expensive optional software a community of greed and wanna be whinning little kids. the fact that at least 5.5/10 people who own this game/mod dont know what half-life is. this mod is great, for something made 10 years ago, this is really good. keep up the good work facepunch!",1
"very fun game, gets addicting even with no friends to play with...",1
"this game is awesome,you guys should buy this game,there are a few of gamemodes,such as hunger games,ttt(trouble in terrorist town)",1
"looks fun but i need all off the textures but other than that it looks really cool",1
"gmod can be any game you want, and thats why i think its one of the best games you can find. its combining a fps/sandbox/multiplayer game all in one. which is a great game in and of itself. :p",3
"best. game. ever. although the game is buggy, weird and glitched in so many ways, those things only add up to the experience. find some friends and have uncountable hours of fun!",4
"i dont think i have ever played a worse game. first off the cs textures should definitely be included if i am paying for a game, gmod is not of sufficent quality to be sold as a full game though i may not be as pissed off at it if it had told me i needed the textures before i bought the game. second of all the mechanics and gameplay is just kind of crappy, no other way to put it. i regret this purchase and should have bought commander keen instead.",1
"really fun to play both offline and online! you should try out trouble in terrorist town!!! really fun mode to play with friends! :) :) :) with kind regards pondaz.",1

"great game.....but you already know that dont you.",1
"tired of the linear games? you like half life series,but they are so short for you? why not to try to make your own story line,with npcs,weapons,entities and other amazing things? but if your talent is ending on the hause-one-stroke? just go and dig around! plant zombies,and make outbreak.plant soldiers,and throw an atom bomb on them! everything is on you! your world,your gamestyle,your rules your fun!",1
"it is a amazing and fun game so many things to do.",1
"garrys mod is one of, if not the, best game ive ever played. it has one of the best communities ive ever seen in a game and pretty much where-ever you go youll find friendly people. the amount of variety and things you can do with this game is unlimited as the gamemodes in multi-player range from roleplay to deathmatch to hunting to survival to whatever! even if you just enjoy a game for its single player, being a sandbox game, you can do literally whatever you want and if you take a few minutes to browse the workshop for addons then youre guaranteed to have a 200% better time. tl:dr you can launch exploding babies from a rocket launcher. 11/10.",4
"garrys mod is a game that uses hl2 and source together to make an amazing fps sandbox with limitless opportunitites and game modes. i would highly recommend this game to people who like to create, destroy, play with friends, and enjoy game modes/mini games.",2

"the only game in which you will have a 10gb addon folder.",3
"beautiful, incredibly varied game with photo-realistic textures, for the most part, and a near-infinite amount of possibilities. over 20 different gamemodes with a thriving community. if you dont have enough variation in this game already, you can download a range of addons that change and add things from weapons to building tools. definitely reccomend to buy this, if you dont have it already.",4
"this game has infinite possiblilties due its sandbox based play. weld weapons and other things from games like doom 3 made by your fellow community players from the workshop. if you by it you will have no regrets and make sure you have all of valves games from 2004 to 2012 to experiance it as it was meant to be.",3
"sandbox game with a ton of stuff to do, especially with the creativity from the modding community, it can become a mess around game, or a serious battle, or even a co-op building game to build the best ship and fight other people. this game is totally worth the 900+ hours i have on it, and especially for a cheap price like it is!",3

"have you ever wanted to _________ in a video game? now you can.",1
"this is a whole ton of fun. especially if you have a good handful of friends to play with. you have to get cs:s and stuff to be able to play a lot of the multiplayer games, but it makes sense. you have to have the data for the maps and what not to see the maps and what not. ha. very fun game types. usually a good handful of games going at any time. really great party game. if youre looking for a game to play with friends, this is an excellent call.",1

"garrys mod -- the all-in-one sandbox game. whether its movies, screenshots, or just mucking about in general, garrys mod should keep you (and others) entertained for a long time. also, its $10. instead of pirating it (like i know a bunch of other people have), just dont buy that pizza you wanted today, and you should have enough for it.",2
"its its fun i got killed by a looking at a clipbord 11/10 would buy again",1
"thrusters everywhere. everyone is dead so much death. i have daily flashbacks of the war because of this i likely have more hilarious physics related deaths than a dozen play-throughs of darksouls. this game is worth everything i payed and more. and unless youre about as creative as a rock youll definitely enjoy the sh t out of this game.",1

"its buggy, its awkward, but really its anyones game. the appeal of garrys mod is that it really stretches the limits of the source engine that can lead to moments of creative inspiration, failure to achieve it, which leads to an even better idea. the fun of the game is really up to you, whether its admiring custom aesthetics created by hundreds of talented or hardworking people, animating stop-motion style with what you have, or just bending the world to your will with an assortment of things to spawn including half-life 2 characters available by default. a very interesting and sometimes under appreciated addition to the sandbox genre.",1
"its awesome to play with friends and just troll have fun",1
"garrys mod is a very different game compared to any other game. there is so much you can do in this game. you can literally make anything out of this game you want to. i would highly recommend it to anyone since they can do anything they want. some of the best things to do in garrys mod is to play ttt,darkrp and jail break.",4

"awesome game 10/10 met all of my friends over on this game <3 gmod 4 life!",2
"in most of gaming, i would say garrys mod would be a pretty unique type of game in its own way. without any singeplayer campaigns, or running off an fps shooter. this game has made some top notch stuff in its latest years. players have built giant robots and towers. while others create action scenes, like out of movies. garrys mod doesnt have a campaign, but makes up for it with limitless opportunities of playing in the multiplayer world. with its many unique gamemodes made by perticular developers, or a group of coders. this game is certainly one of a kind. this game isnt meant for people are who love campaigns and are not as laid back. but if you are, this would be the game for you. ~",3
"amazing endless fun, good to play with friends. 10/10",1
"one of the best sandbox games , its all about converting your imagination to it . a game where everything is possible .... yeah everything is possible 10/10",1
"garrys mod is a physics sandbox. unlike regular games there arent any predefined aims or goals. we give you the tools and leave you to play. you spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether thats a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesnt have a name...",1
"love the game but expect it to piss you the  off with crashes,add-on errors and windows not responding and not allowing you to minimise the window if its being brained all the time",1
"i love the ability to play in a game where everyone can make everything, theres no such thing as a playing wall in this game because someone will just make a new gamemode for you to play.

"this game is awesome. from the second i started playing, i was in heaven!!! when i checked the store, i didnt see much out of it, until i got it. i love that you can get different addons. what i dont like is that you cant search for them. garrys mod is a 8 1/2 out of 10. i think you should get it!!!",1
"too funny. too good. too many gamemodes. just get it, ok?",1
"love the game and is interesting at times 10/10 will buy again",1
"pretty fun game aye lots of stuff to do wont get boring",1
"you dont know what you are missing out on...definitely the most expandable and ever-changing mod i have ever played. i normally get bored of games pretty quickly, but hence the amount of playtime i have with this, it has never ceased to stop entertaining me. the community is very diverse, and depending on what directions you take you will probably find your niche easy. some of the gamemodes play like they could be a game just by themselves, but in any means you can never get bored if you keep trying new things. and singleplayer/sandbox is already perfect enough in that matter, if you find the loading times worth it. very developer-friendly too, it uses lua and as time goes on more and more hooks are being updated and added. definitely worth a script-kiddies time.",5
"awesome thats all i have to say right.....ya just buy it and dl the other stuff online....idk yt it or sumting",1
"this is a great game to pass time with, while some people play minecraft to let their creativity flow gmod will get you thinking. 10/10",1

"awesome game really enjoy it especially with friends.",1
"this game is amazing, well i could say game(s) since its filled with diffrent kind of servers in which you can do different stuff like rp (roleplaying) ttt (trouble in terrorist town) and many others. i would say get this game for an amazing fun for hours and hours on end. the only bad thing about it is you should get cs:s (counter strike: source) since many server need it for textures, modles and other stuff. 9.5/10 must get",3

"a great game with lots of entertainment for many many hours! (i myself have played this game over 1000 hours)! you can get addons and they add a lot into the game! also there are multiple multiplayer gamemodes i prefer you to check out :) in overall i think this game would deserve 9/10 :)",3

"the only game in which you will have a 10gb addon folder.",3
"recommend? yes i do. and no i dont. why? you cant see anything on any map without counter-strike: source! i understand this is a mod but does anyone else understand how frustrating it is to not be able to do or see anything in a game youve wanted to play for ages? this is a great game but you must have the counter-strike: source stuff in order to use it. so just dont bother with this without the source pack, just get the combo.",1

"garrys mod is a pretty good sandbox game featuring: addons steam workshop online multiplayer mode demos",1
"gmod, such an amazing game. build tons of crazy structures, pose some ragdolls, obliterate people with some weapons, and much more. gmods fun is only limited to your imagination. and the workshop, oooh the workshop. yes theres a lot of  in there, but majority is awesome addons to enhance your gmod experience. buy it if you are the creative type or just want to  around. i also would like to make note of awesome gamemodes, but thats for you to experience :)",1

"the best fun i have ever had in gaming! and also the big part of youtube videos about garry is best thing in the universe! hail gaben!",1
"this is a really funny game. i played for first time as a mod almost 8 years ago and it was already funny. now it is more intuitive and easy to use. i strongly recommend this game. have fun!",1
"i spend most of my time just messing around, but overall, its a good way to release your inner creativity.",1
"truly a game of limitless possibility, for those with the imagination. from building towering machines, to surviving an onslaught of whatever abominations you may desire, to experiencing the creations of others, it is truly endless. also surfing through the air on a handbag never ceases to amuse me.",1

"very fun game to play. personally love the ttt game mode but there is a lot more to do! reccomend getting it anytime there is a sale. i still recommend getting it when its not as you may get countless hours of fun out of it.",1
"note this review maybe changed later: ok garrys mod is unlike any game i have played before. i love the community content and the easy way that workshop helps the game have great content. unfortunatly i have a huge flaw with this game. it basically makes you buy any games that are made by valve to play it. i do not have money to pay for games and when i do its for games i want. i hate how i have buy counter strike source or else i get no textures. yes there are a few maps that dont require css textures but it is only a slim few. there used to be a css texture pack you could get on the workshop but it was taken down. other than that flaw it is a very solid game and i am hoping they release the texture packs again.",1
"its countless fun, unlimited possibilities, and you have the world at your fingertips. its great to play alone or with your friends and its worth it!!",1
"classsssssssss.........is all i can say indescribable game",1

"garrys mod i like to do screenshots maybe one day i can do artwork? (>)",2
"you can do anything and everything with this game! though most likely youll end up playing ttt on a minecraft map and youll wonder where the imagination went; right out the window. garrys mod mods are best made by minds much smarter than you, while you attach rockets and balloons to a bathtub with a heavy in it. 10/10",1
"update ruined the game. i had a massive amount of fun with this game pre-version 13, now the game is a mess. the ui and the menus look like they were designed by a 5 year old and they got rid of the save feature (as far as i can tell, either its not there or its way too hard to find). downloads are much harder to find within the game too. dont bother. if you want to make images or movies, get source film maker instead. its a shame, because this game was at one point the best fun i have ever had with only $15",1
"worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this game gives u loads of ideas to b creative! i say this game is 10 out of 10! theres game modes id say this game is worth it. i recomend this game!!",1

"17/10 can masterbate to mexican jumping beans -ign",1
"amazing game, but the only thing that needs to be fixed is the textures from counter strike source. when you buy gmod you should have the full textures. other than that, it is quite my favourite game.",1

"i m not playing this game so long but i m saying it is top steam game for me . there are alot of owesome mods !",1
"really nice sandbox with lots of replayability. just make sure you have counter-strike: source before getting this.",1
"good game that you can get hours of fun from because there is so many things you can do. dont overplay it though because you will most likely become bored like i have.",3
"more a toy or platform than a game, garrys mod turns the source engine into a sandbox, then hands you a shovel and pail and tells you to go at it. gm is fun, and it presents an almost unlimited range of possibility to the player, but its not for everyone.",1
"in the, what is love, what is life? category in my library. 11/10 would categorize again-ign",1
"great game, many possibilities.. or how ever you spell that lol",4

"good game especially when meeting new people. and its fun if youre the playing the game with your friends.",1
"garrys mod is extremely fun and i would recomend it to anyone! the variety of gamemodes are interesting and make it difficult to ever get bored with the game. the formatting and the ease in finding servers are other positive attributes. but, my very favorite aspects to gmod are the community and communication with other players. whenever i play, i look forward most to talking to friends and having a great time!",3
"if you dont get this game then you will never live",2
"if you havent got gmod yet even though all of the sales you really should get it. once you understand the concept of building and stuffs and started getting in with advanced mods like wiremod there is no limit. the best time waster out there",2

"the most amount of fun you can have with your pants on!",3
"you can do just everything graphics - plain and simple uses the same engine as most of valve games 8/10 gameplay - it matters on your gameplay. if you like competitive rpg, fps games it wont be fun but if you love playing just for fun its advised that you play this online! online! singeplayers a minecraft-ish type of gameplay. singeplayer - 7/10 (sorry not a big fun of creation) multiplayer - 10/10 ( you can simply find any mode thatll match up your preferences. verdict - 9/10 you can find almost anything thatll match with your preferences on this game.",3

"wow this game is fun 10 out of 10 would play again haha yay!!!1",1
"there are a ton of neat multiplayer modes on here if youre willing to wait forem to download onto your computer first.",1
"great game in itself. creative and fun, but i mostly just shoot people in singleplayer, as my building skills are terrible in this game. and i mean terrible. tried to armor plate and arm a jeep. completely backfired, killing me and the people that were behind me. but the game is awesome, and so is the modding community. the servers are crap, though. not all of them are bad. but i played ttt, and fell down a well, landing on another person. it killed him, and was completely accidental. i kept playing the game afterwards, but somehow still got banned for rdm and leave, when i hadnt left the game. there are other servers, but this is just an example for you guys, why some servers arent great.",1
"god where do i start. this game is amazing. i dont even know how i started but i got addicted. i played this day and night for weeks. then my grades started to drop and i began to realize my error. however, it was to late and by the time i pulled my head out of it i was failing. be careful and prepare to commit yourself and your wallet to meaningless servers. enjoy it. your life will go to  pretty damn quick. good luck comrade!",1
"although it is a mod, garrys mod feels like a stand alone game as it just uses basic resources of cs:s, hl2 and tf2. with a sandbox single player and an exciting multiplayer, you will never get bored of playing this. it is a stable game, but feels as if it is always in beta as lag and long loading times will occur with any pc system you use, but you can get used to that. some times crashes but all in all still a great game. make sure you purchase cs:s with it and if you dont, you can download the textures it uses anyway for free. 8.8/10 needs to be a bit more stable. would recommend.",3
"one of the best, most flexible, and most fun game to play ever",1
"this game will last for an eternity. the amount of amazing addons people are creating will keep this game alive for years.",1
"this is an amazing game you can do what ever you like. this is game with every game in the world in it.",1
"a good game, fun and with a lot of gamemodes. sandbox is fun with friends but i rather recommend prop hunt and murder. despite what other people say, i didnt really like ttt because its too stressfu.",1
"this is an awesome great! its really fun to play this game with your friends. + normal graphics nothing horrible +great mods like : prop hunt, hide and seek, ttt + great price i got it for 1.99 dollar :d + i highly recommend this game!",1
"garrys mod is one of the best sandbox games currently out on pc. there are no other games like it, once you start playing and find a game mode that you like then you will never stop playing. there are thousands of mods, maps and other general content available for garrys mod through the steam workshop, this content can add thousands of hours worth of game play. go play darkrp.",3
"when i started playing this it was awsome but a mouth or 2 later i cant play single player but i can play muiltplayer this sucks plz fix but still a great game !",4

"garrys mod is... an exciting game for people who are creative and like to build stuff. yet, thats only one part. thats sandbox, a gamemode of the many gamemodes there are. there is tower, trouble in terrorist town, surf, flood, and many more! i highly reccomend this for anyone! the bad side? the only bad side is that garrys mod mostly uses counter strike textures, but i highly reccomend you get the combo: counter strike source + garrys mod, for twenty five dollars.11/10, it is a great game!",2

"best game you will ever buy just take it from me and the hours played",2
"i dont recommend this, i dont hate this game but it sucks when it comes to gameplay and players. most players are either 10 years old or complete s, prepare for trolls. it is  that you have to buy cs:s just to have fun on this game, i would never buy a 20$ game id never play. the missing textures is  and it is a rip-off to buy this game in general.",1
"its a very fun game that you can play with your friends and you can join custom servers.",1
"this is an excellent well designed game the content is vast and exciting all though people should make up some more game modes that are really fun other then that it is a good game very enjoyable",1

"endless fun with all sorts of game types created by the community.",1
"the game looked like fun so i got it, wince then ive played it for a few hours and still prefer it to any other game in my library. the mods make the game at least 5x more fun to play, an additional 5 if youre playing with friends. in direct contrast to the amount of fun this is, this game doesnt actually require that much to run, i could probably run it on my toaster. 11/10 shot a flying watermlon with an awp.",2

"garrys mod is a very sandboxy game, and i mean a sandbox game. there is so many addons in this game that you wont ever get bored for new objects. there is also many different game modes to try out. my personal favorite is sandbox. thrtr is some cons though. heres the list of pros and cons pros: many addons many gamemodes you can really do whatever you want cons: it can be annoying to hear people on the mic. it can be annoying to hear kids screaming to death is more fun with friends, so if your a lone player it might be a little boring. personally, i think the game can get a bit boring at times, mainly loading screens. but, this game can really be for anyone so i think that you should buy a copy and try it for yourself. score 80/100",1

"definetly worth it. the singleplayer is really fun, although i would like to see less of an influence of half-life 2 in it. 90% of the stuff is from that game. nevertheless, singleplayer alone is worth the price. multiplayer is just amazing, with gamemodes like trouble in terrorist town and prop hunt. it makes for endless replayability. the community is an integral part too, creating thousands of workshop items and hosting thousands of servers. all for $9.99? dont forget that it periodically goes on sale for as low as $2.50. definitely get it on sale, and also at face value. you wont be disappointed.",1

"garrys mod is a spectacularly fun game. a sandbox game derived off of a mod of half-life 2, it lets you express your inner silliness and creativity. that point stands out even more so with all the varied workshop content available, ranging from various weapons and tools to props and ragdolls of characters from cartoons and tv shows and the such. overall, gmod is a fantastic outlet for the creative mind, and its definitely worth your time if you like to waste time doing silly things.",2
"really fun game, great game to just play around with in your spare time. the possibilities are endless in this game. you can do whatever you want and it is quite enjoyable. i would recomend this game to anyone who is looking for a game that has tons of freedom to do what you want and build what you want to build.",1

"insanely amazing game. there are tons of game modes with more coming out to the day! its graphics arent state of the art but they are enjoyable still. garrys mod will fulfill the derp in your life. i recomend prop hunt, trouble in terrorist town, death run, gmod tower, murder, and sandbox if you get the hang of it. (sandbox will be very dificuly at first but once you understand and maybe look at a tutorial it is addicting) 10 out of 10 easy",3
"i think that game is the best game ever made ... if you will play it .. you will not stop playing it untill you die",1

"you can do anything. and yes, i mean anything. but if you just want to screw about in sledbuild or trouble in terrorist town, thats fine by me.",1
"this is the best game on steam in my opinion. if you dont belive me look at how many people play it and so much workshop items you cannot get tired.with all the workshop tools,modles,maps and other creations your shure to never get tired of all the game modes like melonbomber, murder, sandbox, trouble in terrorist town or ttt, deathrun, dark rp modes like halo, school, blackmesa and just regular darkrp, by the time you read this far you are about to just go play something or read comments so i dont want to delay!",4

"a very creative game sometime it can get kinda creepy tho but its alot of fun to play with the tools and dolls",1
"its obviously not a game to rate out of 10 easily. the content provided in this game is endless and provided by non game developers. this game is well worth the money and addicting. i have been up at 3 in the morning playing something as simple as zombierp. i recommend this game and if i would have to rate it, it would be 10/10. content is endless.",2

"it is the best game with soo many mods wich is like 1,000 games",1
"ahh... garrys mod. an animation maker, game. ragdolls, models, and the detail me spent his time to do. i know its not free, but it sure is good. i really reccomend it but not for all of you folks. have a nice day..",1
"if youre one for playing a game that sort of requires minimal gaming skill (like this person) but have a functional mic and a likeable personality, then this game is a 100% must. after purchasing, i made more friends than i could have ever hoped for, being that the community is more or less completely welcoming of pretty much everyone - this is certainly for the awkward gamer who doesnt really know what to do with their time and needs a new outlet aside from minecraft! please purchase, and we hope to see you soon!",1

"if you do decide to buy garys mod, you should probably buy counter strike source with it so you can see the textures.",2
"garrys mod is amazing! this is a game sortve like minecraft. but, its more challenging. building houses isnt as easy as it looks on this game. you can go onto the workshop and get more playermodels created by other users. also, you can play online with friends or random players on game modes like terror in terrorist town. or prop hunt. and darkrp. i overall think this game should get a rating of 10 out of 10. this game is just and amazing game.",1

"this is for you no matter the age, gender, size, weight 10/10 never gets boring becuase theres so much in this ten dollar game you can download workshop items or play multiplayer really recomned it and i would also like to say buy counterstrike source with it is recomned because you will have missing texture in some multiplyer servers or gamemodes",1
"you know this game is okay depending on what you like. the mass ammount of games combined in this one game is fantastic, although the community is ing terrible the games themself are enjoyable, the lack of me creating my own private game is a load of horse . now back to the community they are the ing worse, the community mostly consists of 7-12 year old spoil brats if you can handle this i would suggest the game. now the games are okay some are fun .but the download of maps is ing horrible unless you have god like internet the maps themselves take longer to download than playing the actual game. so looking at the community, the games, this game is ing horrible unless you want to get the will to stab yourself i rate it 1/99999999. but thats just me.",1

"best game ive ever gotten and definitely worth the money.",2
"although personally i dislike the sandbox mode of this game, it really shines in its multiplayer game modes. trouble in terrorist town, murder & prop hunt are just one of a few many mini-games that have been created by the community, for the community. although for these game modes you need the cs:s textures, you can download them for free from the tools tab in steam itself. its definitely worth the $5 that it is currently; and once you discover what garrys mod can do, youll never be able to stop.",1
"its a ing awesome game deffo worth money enjoys pplz",1
"in my opinion i see no reason to not like this game. this game has pretty much every thing to do you could imagine you can make gueg working machines drive in vechles make scenes have big battles have small battles experiment with physics experiment with ragdolls play with friends in the many fun gamemodes and much much more this game has pretty much any gameplay you want and you have the power to change it at will this is a sandbox game so there is no story so dont expact that you can create one however check out youtube if you want to see what people do with this awesome game.",1

"garrys mod is a sandbox game consisting of modes from trouble in terrorist town, sandbox mode, elevator source, prop hunt, and so much more. i have played this game for a couple hours and it is the first game i bought from the store. if you get bored of the regular materials you are given you can just go and download some add-ons including maps, weapons, vehicles, npcs, modes and a bit more. i suggest this game for people who like to build and create and have an imaginative mind while also liking to cool down with friends. my overall rating for this game is gotta be around 4 and a 1/2 stars",1
"millions of hours of play at your finger tips for ing ten dollars.",3
"it has nearly unlimited possibility, has a good dev team trying to keep the game updated. so many player gamemodes that are out right now. and are still coming out! though there are some limits to the game. there is so much potential and fun to be have, it doesnt really take away from the experience, anway...any game has its limits.",1
"10/10. large diversity of game types, if your not into sandbox you can play other interesting games such as deathrun, ttt, darkrp etc.",1
"can you imagine a world with both portal and half life in 1 game? well my good people gmod delivers a full experience of pizza eating mods to mods where u can have the space core. this game is unrateable because if i tried...... my computer would explode from trying too give the correct review, and the world would be covered in awesomeness. hey thats not a bad idea brb guys!!!",1
"this game is so fun. with steam workshop and the insane mods, this game will make you not put down your mouse and keyboard for a couple of hours. would reccommend",3

"gmod, how can i put this, garrys mod is one of the most realistic fps since call of duty: mw2. it changed the course of gaming history forever, i have over 400 hours played and can honestly say that garrys mod is real life. i have dropped out of school, my dog has died (forgot to feed since i was busy baking bread on an rp server and was afraid that one of the ovens might explode) and am now living in my mothers basement. but its alright, i am an admin on 4 diffrent gmod servers and have over 100 mil on my main darkrp server. this game has changed my life. im a new man. i am... the gman. 0/10 iest game ive ever played.",1

"garrys mod is a popular sandbox game that is played all around the world! but my favourite gamemode is troulbe in terrorist town. its a fun gamemode where its innocent vs traitor. i highly recommend this game!",3
"from all the time i spent on gmod, its been fun. theres the freedom in sandbox mode. available to play alone or with a friend. the best part is messing with the physics, but thats your choice. :) not feeling creative? theres an endless variety of gamemodes to play, which adds to the replayability of this game. i just dont know what gamemode to mention because there are so many of them. most of the games today like titanfall cost $60 and lack lots of content. if youre looking for a game that will deliver a lot of play, garrys mod is perfect for you!",1
"the reason why nobody can take half-life 2 seriously anymore.",1
"garrys mod, one of the best selling games on steam. if u wanna buy a new game that you like making stuff out of anything! , rping, killing, horror i would recomend this game. the sandbox , is alright, but the most best gamemodes are most likely to be : ttt, darkrp. i give garrys mod 10/10 plus: it only cost $9 xd",1

"garrys mod is a fantastic game! there are many gamemodes that are for many to explore. from ttt, to murder, dayz, etc. i recommend this game for people who are into exploring new games and ideas. the sandbox is a mode where you can do whatever you want! the multiplayer serfers are great as well. i rate it 8/8",2

"i highly recomend this game. it was my first game on steam and by far the best. the add-ons for this are in the hundreds of thousands enabling you to do just about anything. the multiplayer is amazing and the sand box mode is the most flexible mode. if you do not have this game, buy it along with ccs.",1

"i wouldnt really recommend this game thought, even more for mac because crashes! the gameplay is good, yea but as there is no objective its not that fun to play, yes good for making silly gmod videos or having a casual good time but then theres nothing else you can do",1
"okay, if you like creative on minecraft youll love this",1
"this game is hilarious. basicly it has no objectives whatsoever. you just build stuff and make ragdolls have effed up faces and posed so wild they look they tried to do extreme yoga. if thats not your thing then theres the gamemodes. and there is alot of them. workshop for easier modding and downloading mods. i personally like gmod for posing. building and taking scenic/cinematic screens. overall rate: 9/10. it has it flaws like: physics, other online players and sometimes feels rather boring if you are not the imagination type that pumps ideas left-and-right.",1
"i love this game. you can spend hours making movies, screenshots, and just plain goofing around. i strongly recomend this game to any one who likes sandbox games and has a lot of time on their hands if so, it is the game for you!",1
"this game is very satisfying it is full of new things each day i found myself playing it for 637hrs that is crazy and i havent noticed the game is very fun , it is not a serious game so if you are a serious gamer you might not enjoy it that much. the game is a fantastic game to play with friends , i would say if you play the game on your own you may miss some really enjoyable moments out. overall it is a laugh honest ( not in a bad way) it is a fantastic laugh you will lol so haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard read before buying ps : get counter strike source aswell or it wont run that well so gmod i think its 6 with counter strike source which i think is like 10 but its always on special offers (thaaaanks steaaaaaaaaaam xd :) xxxx ) its worth buying !",2

"this game is the most amazing thing created by god! just need to come up with its own textures so you dont have to spend over $200. but really its the best thing to play as long as you have a dedicated server to play on, then youre good.",3
"you can pretty much do whatever you want in this game. it allows you to use the models and maps from a majority of the source games and put them together to build your own games for all of your friends and the rest of the world to enjoy. with a massive community constantly contributing to the content there is always something new to try out.",1
"full of garry and full of mods. whats not to like? :3",2
"so fun. so much gamemodes. so many new friends. but only one game. impressive.",2
"garrys mod is a great first person shooter, that was originally a mod for half life, so you can guess what characters it has in it. it has addons to upgrade your simulator fun, in the game! so thats always easy.it has multiplayer servers such as trouble in terrorist town, murder, sandbox, etc. it has all the stastictics of half life and team fortress 2. it has violence, but thats kind of unavoidable in all valve, steam available games. i definitely recommend this game for all gamers that enjoy all fun in a game, with gravity, and physics guns, maps, traps, and other fun things inside. guns are included which is the only downside of garrys mod. but other than the volience, its a great sandbox game.",1
"its amazing i went to play and i heard a ten year old swearing and then he got mad at me for being intelligent. 10/10",2
"always a good game to play with some friends online because of how much things you can do in it",1
"garrys mod is a very fun mod at first it might take a while to understand at first but once you do the amount of fun is endless . i strongly recommend this to anyone who likes playing sandbox games . it is definetly a must have .",1
"its a good game over all just alot harder to understand on what to even do and how to make different things. i mostly just spawn medics and helpers and kill enemys the whole time. what i dislike about it is the need for other games just so you can play on other servers or make and use different things in your own world. 7/10",1
"great game, its kinda like a cheap version of cod, when you play ttt",1
"i posssesed a watermelon and then was set on fire. 10/10 would buy again.",1

"one of the funnest games ive ever played in my life. its a rare occasion when you have truly limitless potential in a game like this.",2
"really great game, lots of mods with hard work gone into them, u can do anything u want, from a zombie survival to a multiplayer sandbox, you can also do things by your self like building a house or creating a fortress. $10 is a good and reasonable price everyone should buy it",1
"its probably one of the best games you will ever play just because its so different than most others.",2
"yes but beware that when you use your account on another pc you cant seem to play this game in perticular",2
"omg one of the best games i have ever played when you get bored just download some random crap :d",1
"all i can say is worth the money, i didnt know much about how to use it at first but now i know so its alot more fun! i recommend this game!",1
"a great game overall. theres literrally nothing you cannot do.. except fix the errors and missing textures (legally) without spending 20$ for cs:s. i made the mistake of not buying it with the game, thinking it wouldnt matter if there were a few missing textures... i was so wrong. ttt maps are mostly missing textures, any map with cs_ before it is full of errors and missing textures. but if you get cs:s with it, it looks great, and sandbox almost always is fun. overall, i recommend it if you can pay the 30$ for both games. oh, and 95/100.",1
"worst game filled with squeakers -5000/10 bad game",1
"this game is a true masterpiece, its a great game if you have a great mind creating objects and gadgets. there are many reasons why this game is soo good, 1)this game have the workshop so you can download maps,props from other games, weapons, tools etc.... 2)this game have multiplayer so you can have fun with other players in the sandbox. 3)this game have a lot of fun gamemodes: like trouble at terrorist town, minigames, jailbreak, darkrp and a lot more... i hope i helped you guys with this review for making you buying it!",2

"built twin towers blew them up 9/11 would play again",1
"its and awesome and re-inforcement game. it gives you infinite opourtunities for a new game, to create your own game style and have fun on your own. invite your friends and have fun, build a jetpack on watermelon force and surf on the moon with gabe newell, and give him a high-five while he is releasing half life 3. simple amazing game that anyone will enjoy. its worth to give only 7,99 euros for it. 69/69",1

"many things to do from getting items and costumes characters and other to use in singleplayer to playing a fun round of trouble in terrorist town, or jailbreak, and if thats not fun to you go ahead and set up some models to mess with and make a movie or clip for youtube or other things",5
"this game is awesome. i really like how you can do anything in the game.",1

"this game used to be one of, if not the best game on steam. now it is buggy as hell and garry isnt doing anything to patch it. he broke the game and abandoned it to do rust. multiplayer is borked too, it is filled with idiotic fans of awful youtube lets-players (seananners, pdp, etc) and the community is so awful that you are more likely to find a poorly run server than a good one. to anyone who wasnt able to play this game 2 years ago: i am sorry, you missed out when this game was at its quality peak. avoid at all costs.",2

"garrys mod (gmod) is quite a fun little indie sim, that requires you to do nothing and allows you to do anything! a love this game to bits and the community is pretty nice also. my only complaint: this game is pretty much useless without a source game like half-life 2 (ep 1 and 2) or counter-strike:source. but other than that, i would recommend this game to anyone who is bored of the mind-numbing money grabbing games and just wants to have fun!",1
"my second fav game on steam. :) i like all the game styles like ttt and murder. i know some people hate it but everyone has there own opinion. even those you are ing wrong! no jk dont hurt me.",2

"best game ever! period. with the steam workshop having over 100,000 items for gmod you can get weapons, tools, you name it. the only thing that upsets me is that i need counter-strike: source to fill in the missing textures and get better prop hunt. my parents wont let me buy coutner-strike: source coause its m. remember, it seems boring at first, but when you get the hang of it and have mods, it is the most enjoyable thing ever,",1

"seeing a lot of people enjoying the sandbox of gmod. many great videos were produced with it as well, + there are some really nice mods there as well. look at all the characters, it is beautiful! though i have to say, i grabbed it pretty late, and right before the update with prophunt occured, which was a huge disappointment for me, since i grabbed it for prophunt mostly. i will discover a bit more, so untill then, garrys mod rating: 10/10 -just let us move the props on prophunt again please.",1
"this is a realy good, fun, creative game, its definatley worth every penny !",1
"this game is awsome and fun when bord and fun to play with freinds !!! :)",1
"garrys mod is an extremely fun game, because it functions mostly on workshop addons you can turn it into amost anything you want. however because anything besides the normal sandbox vertion of the game need other textures from games that also run source you need to own about half the games valve makes. so, if you wish to play garrys mod it would be best to own most of the games in the valve complete pack. normally this is around $100 but goes on sale for $25 every few months. so i would suggest waiting until the valve complete pack goes on sale and buying it along with garrys mod. all of the games that i have played in the valve complete pack are extrememly fun anyway so youll want to own them just to play anyway.",1

(yes, im aware of the fix but it is a bit of a hassle when its time to update) just be careful as even the best pcs can crash from this sandbox",1

"i like it, but theyre still trying to sham you by making you have to buy cs:source or one of the other games to get the game fully suited up for textures. a lot of the mechanics are also buggy and odd, and at most times it feels as if ive been assigned to build the white house when im trying to make a vehicle.",1
"garrys mod. how to put it. this game strips me of all words its so amazing. you millions of maps to play with and so many weapons to aquire. subsribing to a mod is a click of button.....wow! from npcs, to roleplay servers, to lan parties, to ttt, to murderer, to sandbox. its your world, your game. this game is a 30/10.

"theres something for everybody in garrys mod. i reccomend downloading the gmod tower add on and any deathrun server. for me garrys mod is the very definition of a sandbox game. one simi annoying thing about garrys mod is that many servers expect you to have bought and installed other various valve games such as counter strike source and half life 2 episode 2. if you dont have every valve game installed you will eventually encounter servers with big red missing texture errors all over the place and pink and black checkboard epileptic textures.",1
"why do i like garrys mod? how could something so entirely simple be so amazingly fun. well garrys mod was most likely the best 10 bucks i didnt spend (gift from a friend). you see its not the building or concepts that make this game truly cherishable, but simply the people. the people who are mature and listen to you, and allow you to have a good time along with them in whatever gamemode you specialize in, darkrp, ttt, flood, sledbuild, etc. its as if each new game mode is a whole new game in itself, and it satisfies for endless hours unlike some things like some cod game. there is obviously the small downside of squeakers, but are you really going to let them ruin the game? play this game, buy it now, but dont buy it for the game, buy it for the people.",1

"so if youre bored of games that tell you to do this! do that!, heres the game where you can return the favour. do whatever the hell you want. make a breen cannnon? sure. make a team fortress 2 puppet thing thats got thrusters on the back and a rediculous number of lights? of course. a baby with a knife? any time.",3
"this game is a highly addictive gaem to play around with. wether just in the sandbox fooling around, or trying to figure out who is the traitor among you, this game will have you hooked like a fish. although i must throw in a disclaimer as well. if you dont have counter strike: source in your list of purchased games, then you will find yourself staring at a map convered in a checkered patter and objects showing up as an error sign. not fun. but i would still play this game true or not.",1
"the 8 year olds come and ruin whatever you make. good game though when the kids are in bed.",1
"awesome sandbox game, you can do anything in single player. awesome multiplayer, i love the different gamemodes keep it up <3",3

"it is a great game. probably one of the best games ive played. it shines on so many levels that i cant even imagine what garry could do next. it also comes with mods, from a pack of weapons made by other people, to a new gamemode. i like this game. it is worth the 310 hours. 10/10 edit: i played ttt. someone gave a dude 2k points to kill me. i said guess what in chat, and suicided. after i suicided i flew to my people and the server crashed. 11/10 would suicide again. edit #2: wow this is a real life waster.",2

"very fun indeed, would highly recommend it, you can have all sorts of fun with your friends too.",1
"the game of games. a game that literally allows its players to make the game into whatever they truly want, whether it be building, shooting, role playing, you name it. definitely worth buying. its cheap for what it all offers.",1

"nearly 1000 hours, ive enjoyed them all. everyone should have this",3
"i really like this game for a selection of reasons: 1.you can do anything. 2.if you get tired of sandbox, you can play other gamemodes. 2.5.(technicaly, this is another reason, but it ties in with no.2). it comes with a (imho) really good gamemode, ttt (trouble in terrorist town). 3. it has a massive modding community, including steam workshop. 4. it is constantly updated. i hope this review helped.",2
"fun game..... if the servers didnt take 50 minutes for me to join and why would you need to buy counter strike: source just to unlock the missing textures, servers shouldve already installed them, there are missing textures in almost every server, but the gamemodes are fun, you can place thrusters on cars and drive them, i rate 4.2/10.",1
"dozens of hours into this game and i still have no clue who garry is",1
"garrys mod has one of the most (if not the most) well-updated communities of any game. the game was made in 2006 and the different weapons, gamemodes and maps are still being created every day. not to mention all of the servers dedicated to any gamemode you like. a good game for a new pc gamer, or an old one. and you can get killed by watermelons. 10/10",1

"all around great game, especially when you play with friends. in my opinion the best game modes are: stalker, murder, prop hunt, and stop it slender.",1
"this is a multiplayer game that must have the player be very chill with anything that happens, from random death or just trolls. honestly without these things garrys mod would be bland and just not fun to play. as a player who has mostly played darkrp and sandbox, i must say its amusing to see little kids scream and trolls do their job. if they troll you its best to deal with it rather than threaten them. if we all did this than garrys mod would get more praise from being a fun game for everyone than a game only for certain people. so its worth the money. just have cs:s. trust me.",2
"awesome game with lots of gamemodes made by people and super fun!",3
"i love the game, and all the gamemodes. the only thing that is making me dislike this game with a passion, is a bug thats not allowing me to veiw any servers. hopefully it will be fixed. as i have read, not everyone is having this problem, but it is happaning.. and the problem has been around for more then a year or two.. maybe its not a bug but who knows. but asides that, the game is great, and has many gamemodes for you to play... basicly no matter what you are into game wise. this game has a game for you! its a great game inside a great game! so get it and enjoy it!",1
"garrys mod is a game where you can do any thing up to youre imagination. garrys mod is a sandbox game where you can spawn charecters from youre favourite valve games or diffrent games in general. you can build stuff and do stuff if youre bored. apart of the awesome singelplayer theres also an multiplayer mode thats even more awesome. it adds awesome modes like trouble in terrorist town, prop hunt, slender, murderer and tons more to name. there are some minor things. first of all this game has a steep learning curve you will have to learn the hard way and then of course the infamous texture problems which some times annoys the living hell out of me. but overall the game is amazing and if you dont own it by now buy it immiadetly. i give garrys mod a 9/10",1

"when you not buy it yet you will think this is a fun game / good game, but when you paid $9.99 to buy it, you will want you money back, why? becoz: 1. poor support / no support, when you got problem, you need to google it for help 2. much staff cant use normally or even you can use but with error 3. er... for me, this is not a game and only fun for first 30mins 4. for dev, this is not a good program if i can choose now, i want my money back( i know steams refund policy)",1

"this game was pretty much the basis of me becoming more interested in games, the same goes for alot of other gamers aswell. the wide variety of game modes and addons bring more hours of fun to the game. the funnest game modes for me were ttt, basewars and minigames, which is where i spent the majority of my garrys mod time. there are also servers that you can relax on, such as the cinema servers, and watch what you and those around you are interested in. if you have yet to play/buy this game, i would really recommend you get this as i would describe it as a necessity for any pc gamer. 9.5/10",2

"i have always liked simulation games, but garrys mod has always succeeded the limit of fun and enjoyment. because the only limit is your imagination and you can do whatever you want, whenever you want and as much as you want. for me its one of my favourite games to mess around and have fun with my friends, or make friends probably in different servers! but most of all i gmod (garrys mod) always makes it fun for me and aswell my friends, as you socially increase your limit of imagination by sharing which makes gmod one of the unique games of enjoyment with social sharing. ;) i recommend this game for anyone who would like simulation games or just to mess around. :)",1
"this game is great! the only thing though is that you would want to get counter strike source if you plan on getting it because a lot of servers require it for different textures and what not. other than that the playability of this game is awesome! ive spent over 1000 hours on it at the time of writing this who knows how many more i will spend playing it in the time to come.",3

"do you like to model objects? do you like to play crazy gamemodes thatll make you laugh your head off? do you like squeakers? if you answered yes to all these questions, this is the game for you! overall, the game is very solid with the ability to model objects with friends or do it alone on sandbox servers or fool around with friends on other gamemodes. warning: never go on random servers!!! unless you like squeakers and lots of them. this game is a lot of fun if you want to play with friends or go at it alone, but the online community is full of squeakers. people who are 8-13 years old whos  parents thought it would be smart to buy them microphones and let them stay up after 9:00 pm. its fun, but the squeakers, man.",1

"this game is one of the best sandboxes ive ever seen in my life, but that sandbox isnt even 10% of what this game has to offer. the community is huge, with literally thousands of fun addons. any person will like this game, because it has everything. on top of that, the multiplayer has, again a huge amount of gamemodes that will make you play this game for a long time. besides the game, i recommend also getting cs-s because it adds a lot more props and stuff to the game and also fixes some of the visual errors on props on other servers.",2
"a awesome game with alot of replayibility so buy it.",1
"this game is a great way to express there creative an suwat destroctive behavor",1
"a great sandbox game. you can do whatever you want, literally.",1
"this is no game. anyone who argues to the contrary is not actualy thinking.. this is an experiment. it is a show. it is a picture. it is a game. it is a movie. it is a simulation. it is whatever you want it to be, but its not just a game. look at my hours on this. i have cried playing this. i have died laughing. literaly, i have died laughing. garry didnt make this, he started this. this was made by everyone. everyone who made theyre own little bit. i have yet to meet the man garry, for some reason... but i still love him for entertaining me for weeks on end. i had spent 2 days on my computer with only the occasional break to go to the restroom or eat/drink. yes i recommend this, but its no game. if anything, its art.",2
"i like it, but dont go crazy with addons i broke mine",1
"get this game if you have 50 gb to spare (thats for the addons only) but the game when you download is pretty small. i reccomend this game to people that are not twelve! (to much twelvies) follow me on twiiter: @canofcatfood",1

"gmod is a good game. it has lots of fun addons to choose, and it is also referenced to tf2. theres lots of people to shoot and troll, and its fun. i r8 8/8 and reccomend to anyone with a spark of intelligence that must be shared.",2
"buggy load of crap that you cant help but love facepunch have made a really good game/unfinished product i use unfinished in a vauge sense since i know it wont ever be finished but some of these glitches/bugs need to be fixed sometimes rendering the game unplayable and the community is pretty rubbish mostly 12 yearolds and people without brains being trolls i say quote on quote because they dont know what troll means but anyway greatgame try and stay away from darkrp servers its were you find the most opporent people",2
"a great game for creating stuff. the mods and items are enjoyable (hence the name). i would buy this game again and i would also recommend this game for other people.",1
"great game, many servers to join and enjoy. if multiplayer isnt your thing, you can download many different things from the workshop and mess with them in singleplayer. only problem is that with some textures, you need team fortress 2 and counterstrike: source. you can still enjoy the game without those game, though. 9/10",2
"because, ya know, who doesnt like making silly things.",1
"im gonna be real honest with you, the game is great, but (correct me if im wrong on this) the source engine needs to be updated, a lot of things in the game look like its straight from hl2",1

"this game is sooooo much fun, its multiple game modes provide a choice for everyone, from dark rp to prophunt, from sledbuild to ttt, this is a truely amaizing game. i highly reccomend it to anyone as this is truely great fun and is better when youre playing with friends. the only downfall i see with it is that its using the source engine.",4

"it is a do what ever game that you could play forever",1
"i highly recommend this game, it has a ton to offer.",1
"863 hours and counting on this game. had it for at least four years. i think that alone explains how amazing this game is. the sandbox mode is perfect, but its not what makes it great. the gamemodes inside the game, ttt, prophunt, clockwork, etc, make it one of the most veristile games out there. 10/10",5

"===edited as of january 2nd, 2015=== i dont care about the kind of game you like, buy it, gmod is already all of those. you want to build? you can do it in gmod. you want to kill? you can do it in gmod. you want to play hide n seek? you can do it in gmod. you want to play puzzles? you can do it in gmod. you want to do parkour? you can do it in gmod. you want to run a illegal street race with a bathtub? you can do it on gmod. or maybe you just want a 3d online chatroom that you can do stupid dance animations while yelling on the microfone? you can do it in gmod even better than you can do in second life and with 60% less naked furries. you want to buy gmod now? if you do, i bet you can buy gmod in gmod if you try hard enough.",1

"usually on gmod i only use the making pictures part, partly cause if i wanted to shoot people, id go on counter strike or team fortress 2. seeing from my point of view, this is the only game where i could use my imagination as freely as can be. no other game encourages creativity and imagination quite like this one. it pops you in with tools to create just about anything you want. you can get just about any model from the communtiy workshop or use the already mentioned shooter modes such as trouble in terrorist town or prop hunt. would i recommend this game? i sure as hell would, to anyone with an imagination! :d",1

"you build stuff out of static props of various shapes, boring. you spawn npcs that cant act on their own, boring. all the custom gamemodes you can play online are inferior versions of other games. i feel more meaningful creativity from customizable character/class builds in action games since what im doing has an actual effect. sitting back and seeing some useless creation i wasted hours to build seems horrible to me.",1
"welcome to garrys mod, my most played game on steam. but wait. garrys mod isnt a game in the truest sense of the word. it is a foundation. some people go and take those foundations, and play with them. manipulate them, and share that foundaion with the rest of the world. others decide to take those foundations, and create whole buildings out of it, and others just collect those foundations and buildings and use them how they were meant to be, then they take certain parts of those buildings and foundations and use them with other people, and sometimes, they dont even have to be with those buildings and foundations to do so. if you got confused by this review, good for you. this game gets a 9 out of 10.",1

"my personal favourite game of the year. if you are thinking of buying it, i would suggest you to search a friend who also has the game. it makes much more fun playing it with a friend than alone. the multiplayer is good too, althoug it takes forever to join a server (its because every server has their own settings and addons, which you must download first, the game does it automaticly9",1
"it sucks plz have a refund page because my brother bought this game and i told him not to so i just lost $!0 plz plz i like it if u do and a make a video about how good it is",1
"this game is amazing value! there are many different gamemodes to choose from like trouble in terrorist town, darkrp, flood or just getting creative in the sandbox mode. this was one of the first games i ever bought and i have never regreated it for a second. if this game is ever on sale you have to get it!",2

"newton? einstein? these names mean nothing here. within the universe of source the only name that matters is newell. he is the beginning and the end. the alpha and the omega. everytime you start this game get out your valve decorated prayer rug and face the west coast. reality is no limit and neither is modern physics. the only limit is your imagination... and the skybox.",1
"there are so many ways to play, so many ways to enjoy. endless hours of hilarity in prop hunt, some creeps in morbus and spooks in stop it slender. get your survivor on with stranded, and kill all of your friends without eny particular reason in trouble in terrorist town. or, you could mess with physics in sandbox. i have gotten so much value out of this, and i think that its seriously underrated. sure, twenty dollars is a bit pricey, but its worth it for the blood, sweat, and hilarity of this mod.",1
"im a pokemon shooting vending machines from a pistol at sanic hegehog. its not working -5 seconds later- i died and sanic told me to step it up 10/10 goty",2
"an amazing game there is unlimited fun!!! you can do anything!!!",1
"endless entertainment especially if you find a good community to settle down in. there is so much you can do in this game i cant even begin to describe, from sitting in a virtual movie theater like a bunch of losers, to betraying your friends and hanging their corpses for all to see and laughing about it with them merrily. not to mention the customization and freedom developers have to create countless gamemodes so youve never truly tried everything. 10/10 would marry garry",4

"buy this game and start creating your crazy things !!!",2
"garrys mod is one of the most enjoyable games i own. with there being thousands upon thousands of mini games and servers to play on you will most likely never get bored. being able to build your own contraptions or custom maps is very entertaining and will let you be able to explore your creativity. the tools that you can used in the game make it very easy to accomplish that. not only that but you can have so many fun experiences with your friends in servers for hours at a time. so i highly recommend this to anybody who wishes to have all of that in one game.",1

"definetly worth it. the singleplayer is really fun, although i would like to see less of an influence of half-life 2 in it. 90% of the stuff is from that game. nevertheless, singleplayer alone is worth the price. multiplayer is just amazing, with gamemodes like trouble in terrorist town and prop hunt. it makes for endless replayability. the community is an integral part too, creating thousands of workshop items and hosting thousands of servers. all for $9.99? dont forget that it periodically goes on sale for as low as $2.50. definitely get it on sale, and also at face value. you wont be disappointed.",1
"this game is fun with lots of multiplayer severs and roleplay servers too!",2

"i find this game to be terrific and unique and i highly recommend this game for people who love minecraft",1

"ah, garrys mod. one of the most beautiful gems in the whole steam library. before i even give you my thoughts on this, im telling you right now. buy this! it doesnt matter what type of games you like to play, as this is a sandbox game, where you can really do anything. using the steam workshop, you can download add-ons that enhance the expirence, and heck, even make your own! keeping in mind that this is a mod of valves source engine for games such as team fortress 2, left 4 dead, portal, and others, you can mount these games on, and extend the madness! so, yeah. if you pretty much have an imagination, get this. its worth it. i give garrys mod a 10/10.",1

"to many things to download to get it up and loading and i cant download oneof the problems so i cant play the game at all so i rate this game 0",1
"i seriously suggest that you also have the counter strike source so you are able to play most of the popular games through this mod. this is seriously fun if you have a friends on the same local server, but im still working on playing it with a personalized server for friends a few states over.",1
"awesome game! you can build anything you want and has a bunch of cool gamemodes.",2
"this game is honestly extremely fun based on what you play on it. the only problem i have with this game is with the brand new patch. my garrys mod open to the loading... screen then crashes with no errors, i have tried every fix for this problem, but none works. i cannot play this game anymore due to this bug. thank you!",2

"i was abused by a chair that was being controlled by a npc. i also made a cake",1
"i have no idea why i didnt review my most played game earlier, probably because i have very little to say. okay theres no story, no missions, no levels per say. what you do is whatever you feel like. feel like buidling a rocket? go ahead. feel like making a sled? go ahead. feel like bulding a robot which you can make love with? you cant but dont let that put you off. if you want the full gmod experience you should get cs:s which will let you see textures in most places instead of purple and black textures. the game is always being updated ingame by players so custom games mode will always be improved.",4

"i dont think ive ever played a game longer than garrys mod. ever since gmod 9 i have been building various interests of the mind and playing so many different gamemodes that this game should be considered multiple games in one. although the community isnt as strong today as it was, there is no better place to make a server with friends and build random creations to the hearts content. (or until one of your friends blows your  up) i should also mention the better part of the online community now is made up of rpers or people playing trouble in terrorist town.",4

"a true garrys mod player does posing, animations, building, playing dark rp and zombie survival. a true gmod player plays on an online sandbox and keeps to himself but respects others, a true gmod player uploads good dupes and saves, a good gmod player makes workshop content. if youve ever been called a mingebag/minge or have called a minge a clone or only played past gmod 12, spawn dupes on servers or makes  sexual themed dupes or plays ttt, or prop-hunt, youre likey to be a massive thundercunt who should gtfo and go find a completely new game. i do reccomend this game because the amount of good players there are out there seemingly just make the experience a whole lot better. dont worry about the  mingebags.",2
"this game is literally the only reason half life is selling any ing copies as of right now. and, honestly? its worth it. if you love sandbox games, and this and half life 2 are on sale, just buy the darn game, along with counter strike: source. you will not regret it, when your game is free of purple and black error text. this game is the game for those who are bored, you will always find something to do here. whether its building, prop hunt, zombie survival, or the famed trouble in terrorist town (ttt), you will eventually find your places here, and use it for many years to come, as i and millions of other users have. enjoy. :^)",1

"garrys mod... once you start the game it is like you enter a time machine, you can do so many things and play so many mods... it never ends. it uses the source engine and lets you use all props and npc/ragdolls from all source games. this game is the most fun if you play it with some friends! 9/10",1
"this game is a grey area. much like life itself. you will find crazy fun & addictive games. you will lose the concept of time itself. you will find 12 year old admins on most servers. you will lose your  when they ban you for little to no reason. you will find bronies. oh, you will find bronies. you will lose your sanity hearing them speak. you will find creativity that has yet to be replicated anywhere else. you will lose patience trying to find a decent community. i recommend this game for everyone that wants to have insane fun. just know what you get yourself into when you pluge into the depths of this insanity.",1

"garrys mod is a really fun game, my opinion of course. i just have fun building stupid and fun things like torcher chambers,for ragdolls, and slides. i like to connect rockets to two ragdolls so it looks like they are thrusting each other xd. but im sure there are other people who should buy this game that can make more extrodinary, and awsome creations, like mecha bots or whatever is hard to make. some people might think its easy to build advanced creations, but to tell you the truth, i think it takes skill to build planes, huge robots and other big creations. basically im just saying that you need to know how to use all the tools like thrusters, ropes, and other advanced tools. but otherwise, if you have those skills, then im pretty sure youll like this game.",1

"a game that has spawned a major machinima subculture, has countless gamemodes, some being good and some being terrible, gives the person the ability to create fan pictures of their favourites games to a certain artistic degree and finally in general is fun no matter how you play. its on sale as i type, get it!",2
"absolute blast with this game as people add more and more mods it just keeps getting better! very recommended for all!",1
"i got chased around by psychotic gnomes with knives while i rode a top hat wearing goat that was on fire. i think i have found my destiny in life. 10/10",1
"it is a great game all by itself but when you mod it oh my god :d just too much fun!",2
"this game is honestly fantastic. there is so much to it, you can build amazing structures, fool around with your friends, make movies and so much more.",1
"there is no metascore on it. 0/10 best worst game ever.",1
"i have r$20,00 on steam. it costs r$16,99. with promotion i get it for r$4,99. im gonna get it at r$16,99 because its really worth it! this game kicks so many butts at once.. terraria, starbound, counter-strike, call of booty, battlefield, trackmania, need for speed, grand theft auto, apb reloaded, maplestory.. this game is perfect! 11/10!",1
"playing garrys mod is a bit like joining a social group a few months after its set up. the ship has sailed and for those on the ship it appears to be the best game ever, however for those of us left on the shore, garrys mod comes across confusing and almost too much effort to be worth investing in. if you dont understand me, go and join world of tanks (google it) you will soon understand.",1
"you can drown your co op friend with couches. 10/10 would drown with watermelons as well",1
"pretty much a game for everyone, you can make whatever you think with the tools available, or the many addons created by the community. you can create battles between factions, many kinds of apocalypse, or just build. even without addons, you can make detailed and insane creations. you can create frozen scenes with ragdolls, or use them in uploaded saves as corpses. sure, it has its glitches (some of which i have no idea how to fix), and the fact that you need certain games for the full experience, but it still makes up for it with its fun. id say 9/10, but only because of glitches and needing games. pretty nice game.",1
"i dont recommend this game you have to have counter strike to see all the textures.plus it takes forever to play on a server and it freezes a lot it takes forever to join a server.but if you have the extra money for counter strike and hearing squeakers yelling in there mics all the time, then im not stopping you from getting the game!",1
"garrys mod has no point. thats what i love about it. you cant beat it so you just keep on playing. you can create your own games or random scenes or just blow up everything. i never really like sandbox games but garrys mod is amazing.",2
"awsome game, so much to do, anything can be done (not litrally)",2
"this game is pretty good if you find something to do that isnt sucking .",1
"one of the best gateway games to get into pc gaming. there isnt anything negative i could say about garrys mod, to be honest! should you buy it? yes. right now? yes. i dunno why youre browsing the review section, just buy the game! its hours upon hours of fun, even offline, but its better online with friends (which i cant really do xd) but you should buy this right now.",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. a must have for any steam user :d",1
"hey fellow gamers! this is garrys mod an amazing sandbox game. not only is it a sandbox game, but with this game you are able to download many gamemodes and itmes such as weapons and vehicles. yes, all for free. well, the game isnt free but every single mod is. not sure if you should spend the ten bucks? well it is worth every cent spent. you can play downloaded gamemodes online or just have a private game with your friends. truly this game is one of a kind and quite amazing one too! you shouldnt need a single word of advice now. scroll up, buy, download, and enjoy the wonders of garrys-mod. hope you enjoy this unbeleiveale game!",1

"its good, great creativity alot of fun! the workshop is what does it the most.",1
"garrys mod is one of those games you hear about from a friend, go to all kind of effort to get working correctly so you can play it with them, and in the end, its all worth it. this game definately has its quirks, dont get me wrong. it suffers issues from new users missing textures to other assorted bugs like control-z crashing a server. but the game just offers so much, whether you want to play a gamemode or make one, garrys mod is really a great tool. i never knew i could get such enjoyment out of $2.49. garrys mod recieves an 8.5/10; if it fixed some bugs and made it easier to start playing it could be a 9.5/10.",1
"i is very fun and you can do almost do every thing!",1
"garrys mod is a very good game in my opinion. there are loads of communities that come together to host servers. the only problem is that gmod is not updated much meaning the mac support suffers as there are occasional crashes when using the mac os version. id recommend this to anyone whos looking for a good roleplay game or someone who wants to be part of a growing modding community.",2
"amazing, full of awesome gamemodes and great with friends.",2
"100 games in 1. lots of fun playing specially with friends. you get to meet lots of people too. i def recommend it.",3

"you can do almost anything in it, it is literally hours of fun, especially if you play with your friends",1
"this is the mod to rule them all. with nothing in particular keeping you from doing anything, the only thing keeping you back is your pc specs and mods you dont have installed. it is funner with friends to do random things with.",1
"its really good and there is alot of different ways to play it",2
"i can be an anime girl that mercilessly kills innocents with my sick awp dragen loor skeen whilst 360ing i say 10/10",1
"amazing. that is the only word i can think of that describes this game best. its not only one game, but multiple, people are still making game-modes for it right now! i would recommend this game for people who are looking for a game that is competitive, looking for a fun time with friends, looking for something to build, and even people who want to do short films using the sandbox. the best part about this game is that the community is very involved with making the game better, and you can even make your own rag-dolls, character models, weapons, game-modes, tools, ect using the garrys mod workshop. overall this game is a bundle of joy, and very very fun!!!",1
"amazing game.. there are so many ways to play.. so many things to do... over thousands, maybe millions of players...! constant updates.. even the community can add stuff to the game... amazing, you can play for 100s of hours and not be bored even thousands. over 100s of gamemodes even! this game is worth it!",1

"game, crashes every second, lags like , and developer is a huge  eating tard",2
"do i even have to say anything about this. its not like im the only one who owns it. -_-",2
"great sandbox games and the addons allow unlimited fun!",1
"one of my favourites, you can do so many things on gmod and play on different servers that it doesnt get boring! ttt + prophunt ftw :)",1
"nice game though if you wanted to play prop hunt or ttt (trouble in terrorist town) you would need counter strike source and global offensive because it requires the maps to play them",1
"love it. the are very fun gamemode and custom modifiy iteams which makes the game so fun",1
"you can do anything, literally anything! buy this game!",1
"s to garry and facepunch for making a good sandbox game and ruining it. you should of maked a er insted like srsly  off you little piece of  kuk unge lilla garry fittta jag sk aknulla dig i rslet din lilla kuk",2

" best sandbox game, great for meeting friends, build with them, have fun with them. i recommend this game to people who likes puzzles and build games. 9/10 ",2
"fun game for people that want to mess around and make creations or if youre not good at that play one of the many multiplayer game modes that this game offers. only annoying thing is that you need the css content or your textures and models will be kind of ed.",5
"just look at my hours. thats what i feel about this game.",4
"a very funny game for play with your friends and laught with them.",1
"this is a amazing game i never get bord of it so many things to do on the game its endless",1
"one of the best possible released games in the history of forever. 11/10",1
"this game is a very fun game that i highly recommend for everyone. i already have hundreds of hours into this game and im going to get more. one thing though, you have to basicly buy every valve game to get all the textures to actually play it without missing textures. other than that go on ahead and get it.",2
"one of my favorite games, hours of fun! lots of gamemodes!",2
"garrys mod is an experience no doubt, an amazing experience. there are no goals in garrys mod other than have fun. whether that be through the antics of ttt or the hilarity of prophunt, i guarantee this game will have something that appeals to you. absolutley everything is player driven, game modes, weapons, maps, props, and just about anything else you will ever want will be in this game. 11/10 would play again. p.s. do yourself a favour and buy the damn game already, you will not be dissapointed.",2
"it was fun and great to play single player and multiplayer",1
"hours and hours of fun, plus addons makes time seem to fly with this game!",4
"lets start off by saying. this game is awesome! but you need sources like counter strike so if you are think about getting a deal for 10$ youll be missing 90% of prop hunt etc. and the community is awful i joined a game and i was pushing a guy with a single cube and then what happens? an 10 year old  admin bans me. not to mention slow load times online sometimes in single player but where all of that is made up is that its constantly expanding through the steam workshop. everythings just so fun except me never being able to host a server with my friends (for some reason idk) overall 5/10 wouldve got an 8/10 if the community was not trolling 10 year olds.",1
"it is the best creative game i have ever played. there is no line to stop, you can just carry on and build and just play forever! i think every steam user should have this game. although it is (a little bit) buggy. but that could just be my pc. and also you can abuse babys and put them in toilets.. 10/10 get the game now!",2
"cant say i dont enjoy the experince of being a brick for a few a days at a time",1

"went on a custom sandbox server. spawned a bunch of mellons. shot it with rpg. mellons killed me best ****ing game ive ever played. 16 trains/9 chairs",1
"garrys mod is one of the best games i ever played. i reccommend this to people who have good creativity and imagination. it takes alot of brains to do somethings. but you can do more then just build things....modding things, or play on gamemodes like, darkrp, ttt, stranded and many more then i care/can to remember. :) make sure you have these games installed: counter-strike: source, half-life 2: episode 1 and 2....but you mostly need counter-strike: source",5
"like dicking around? buildin random shiz? this is he game for you. i have one sentence. one. i build an airplane, out of a bathtub.",1

"well everytime i start it up it says that steam cant sync to garrys mod so yeah thats been 3 days now and i want to play gmod! can you fix it please!?",2
"you can do anything you want in this game. there is such a lot of choices of game modes that you will never get bored of it. so much choices in the workshop that you can always make this feel like a new game. all the gamemodes are so much fun as long as you play with friends making it even more fun",1
"its a really cool sandbox game but could use some bug fixes... other wise it is a very good game. ;)",1
"this game is awesome i love this game its good to play multiplayer on but you can also just make a server and have a great time.",2
"its a really good but on thing my gmod spawn menu doesnt do anything i cant change player models cant spawn anything in the whole game does anyone know how to help i do not have a wireless mouse",1

"i have wasted a total of 30 days since i got this game 6 months ago. basically 15% of my total time in 180 days went to this game. if that doesnt say its good than i dont know what does.",3
"this is the best game that i have seen on steam in years. you can do just about anything you can think of on this game. definitely a 10/10.",3
"this is so cool this game i was want it so much and now i have it",1
"well this game is weird in many ways but that is what makes it fun to play i like to play prop hunt then sandbox this game gets a ten from len",1
"just wow... a friend got this game for me so we could play together, and boy have we played. one of the best multiplayer games out there, if you get bored of one mode you can just move onto the next, overall an amazing game that i would recommend to anyone and everyone :)",1

"garrys mod is fun, if you like fun, buy it, if you are a fun hater like isaac, dont buy it",1

"i joined a rp server, became a gun dealer, godfather liked me, i now rule a whole city",1
"this game is awesome get this game omg its so good hours of fun with friends and it never gets old",1
"garrys mod. there are so many mods that if you buy this game, youre pretty much buying every single game also it can be a hobby meow",2
"a game that has infinite possibilities. i found that it was a very enjoyabe game. i would reccomend this game to whom ever likes being creative and also has the pacience to do so. there are many servers and many game types to choose from, and also many mods from the community workshop to make playing this game even more enjoyabe.",1
"more than one mode and it has all these addons. gmod also allows you to explore in many different ways.",2
"ttt is one of the most diverse pc games ive ever played",2
"i think you should play this, i really do. however, you wont really be able to enjoy gmod without half life 2, cs:source and tf2 would also help. so although gmod itself is quite cheap, you might end up having to buy more games in order to play. *i already had those* that being said, i would pay 15 for trouble in terrorist town alone, but this game is not just that, its a deep tool for 3d animation and good exposure if you want to have a portfolio of level designs etc. 9/10 under the right circumstances.",1
"a good game, alot of gamemodes. there is not much to say about this game, except from that its amazing.",2
"garrys mod is a really fun game to play. if you want to buy it, its not that much either, just be prepared, youll need counter-strike source for it to work or at least to have css-content, textures and maps wich can be found on .era.ee. from there, follow the insturctions or over the youtube. after you buy it, if you already dont have bought cs source then go to that site that i told you and figure it out. anyway, game is awesome, still some bugs here and there, so buy it fast, cuz, its getting worse if u wait. 9/10 just because of bugs... - static",1
"it is the most enjoyable game ever! you can play with friends (killing them *evil smile*) and do all sorts of games. i totally love this game!",1
"i recomend this game if you like sandbox games you can do alot in servers like ttt (trouble in terrerist town) when you have to find out who the traitors are and kill them. also a minigame called murder is about finding out who the killer is and shooting him/her. this game is very hard to understand at first and sometimes when you try to exit it crashes but the game is still very fun. if you dont have this game you can not live so get garrys mod now",1
"i bought this game when it was for sale in february. didnt care how much it was. i just wanted it so bad! so then i bought it and have had a ton of laughter since then. why are you reading my comment when you can buy the game and have fun?!",1
"the best sandbox game in the history of sandbox games!!!!! awesomness- check guns- check roleplay- check multiplayer- check pretty great graphics- check posing- check buy it or else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"i liked this game because i can play half life 2 roleplay and just mess around on my single player world.",2
"this game is really fun and random sometimes. best experience once you get addons for the game. and the multiplayer is really cool to. all of this for 10 bucks get it .",1
"this game is possibly one of the best sandbox games out there that has a fair price. what makes this different from other titles is it has a growing community that not just plays the game, but makes mods, gamemodes and much more content. garrys mod is great, but the things it lacks is graphics and textures. since garrys mod takes textures from other games, you need to get that game so errors, missing textures and script errors dont pop up. but its a small price to pay just to get counter-strike: source. garrys mods community is filled with large maps and mods that are interesting. this game is amazing. so i give it a 97/100.",1
"garrys mod is a fun kwerky creation toy that can satisfy just about anyone. with its amazing creation possibilities garrys mod is playabl for ages without losing its charm. i highly recomend it to and and all creative people out there who play games like minecraft.",1
"first time i played got killed by a flying door and then got yelled at for destroying a players master piece. 10/10",1
"i tied a ballon to a guys ballsack and he floated away 10/10",1
"absolutely incredibly game, worth every penny. only downside is the lack of textures if you dont have other games such as cs:s",1
"its a fantastic game. its funny and ridiculous, but also a serious first person shooter, zombie survival, and so much more. it has a great multiplayer setup as well. easy to mod, it has its own modding api, and fairly stable, i have not had many glitches since i started playing it! i love this game and play it all the time.",1
"hilarious game when played with friends, however you may face some difficulties when using the default maps and the downloaded maps. i give it a 3.5 / 5 .",1
"it is best game that never ends and very nice and well made and it has no physics it is fun to play so i recomend to everyone",1
"this is a really fun game. i love playing with my friends, sandbox!",1
"man, this game is fun as heck. there are numerous game types you can play, and you can play for hours. while its not my favorite game, its still awesome because of the freedom you have in it. if you can afford the other games that go along with some of the gamemodes (cs:s, for example), you can play a lot of cool types.",1
"tis a strange game, it has a good physics engine and allows the creation of various buildings, vehicles, and people to experiment on. its a very good sandbox game with different addons and gamemodes to play with your friends. i recommend this game to people of all sizes.",1
"this game in its heart is more like every genre of game out there. if it exists its in this game.",1
"i joined a server and people yelled at me for not getting in line and then killed me with a vending machine picked up my body and threw it into an incinerator 10/10",1
"this game is so fun... but this is a mod, not just a game! there are some of the characters in hl2. but for example, if you want left 4 dead characters in gmod, you need to have l4d (i am pretty sure this is true). you can also download maps and other stuff from the workshop. and you can use all of these fun tools to use on everything. from building to face posing, gmod is a really fun and funny game.",1
"this is what i call digital playground ! fun gamemodes, milions of differend addons that you can instal and have fun with. gmod is a game with a lot of games inside ! plus the source engine makes it more fun :d",1
"what seems like a regular game at first, the more addons you get, the more awkward the game becomes. but that is not a problem. it is the best game i have ever played. from bombs to shotguns, towers and hobo shacks, tf2 to counter strike, zombies to giant worms... this is the game anyone wants it to be.. i mean really.",1
"can do fun fun fun fun. 9/10, would be better with more dongs",1
"i love playing ph and murder on garrys mod. its the best!",1
"a genius modification to the source engine, wich allows you to manipulate and create everything from half life, team fortress 2, counterstrike, etc. a lot of fun wich a big amount of tools to make a fantastic experience with or without friends. even with the toybox, to download even more items, for free! there is no better game than garrys mod. game on!",1
"good game cause there is many gamemodes and there will be one for you :3",1
"i was a beer bottle in a toilet, accidently became toilet. juked 4 people as said toilet and won a game of hide and seek. 10/10",1
"do you like creating whatever you want with almost no limits! garrys mod is for the few who love to create, build, roleplay, and just have some plain old fun! anyone who enjoys doing any of the following should absolutly, no doubt, get this game!!",2
"this game is fun and i highly recommend it because it is definetley worth your money. either buy the source engines or download the textures!",1
"why do we need a life when you can spend millions of hours playing a game where we do nothing but troll the untrollable, eat the uneatable, and kill penguins. this game is visually stunning as it uses the dice engine to eliminate all forms of space travel. with its uncomprehensable server browser ordering a pizza is far from easy! all the while pooping in your poop bucket. thank you for your time.",2
"if you didnt find something in this game by searching, you will get it. 24 hours promise.",1
"10/10. great game, a lot of fun. if you get this game, be prepared to be sucked in and never get off.",1
"garrys mod is awsome sorry for you out there who cant get it... so sorry",1
"this game is a gem. such excite. very sandbox. so physics. wow.",1
"this game can be very fun. it has a wide selection of gamemodes to play and people to talk to. i do recommend that if you were to buy this, you will have a better time playing with friends. sure you can meet some annoying kids on this game who dont shut their mouth. but that is why you have a private game with your friends. they are great people to dont get me wrong, but sometimes they can just be annoying good game, do recommend to people that have friends xd",1
"ultimately, this is the greatest game ive ever got, this is the most clean standalone source mod ive ever played. in this game you can put ragdolls, pose them, kill them, hold them a thing, etc. also theres lots of fun gamemodes. story: 10/10 - as if theres no story, you are one who builds up the fun. controls: 10/10 -  up controls, that is the way. graphics: 8/10 - i just love the awesome logo and also the hud. music: 5/10 - even if i just loved this game, theres no music, but in some gamemodes or servers, there is. gameplay: 10/10 - wow. such ragdolls. much fun. very mod. total: 4.3/5",1

"i love this game, its my 1st steam game i got but now things changed fnaf is the only saves and dupes and they are all crappy but that doent ruin the game",1
"i loved this game until i downloaded too many mods. bye bye gmod.",1
"absolutely great game! you can play many mods and community made maps. you should probably buy counter strike:source first and then gmod otherwise you will be missing some textures. 8.5/10",1
"its literally a game about nothing! although snagging models from different games and doing whatever you want to them sounds fun, it can get boring at times. id recommend using this game for recording videos and posing for screenshots, because gmod actually does have a few good gamemodes such as cinema, sandbox, and even prop hunt! overall, i do think the game is good, but isnt really that unique in its own way.",1
"great game!!! i play it most of the time on steam. (5 stars)",2
"very fun and gets the mind into a creative mode +rep to the creator would play again! :)",1
"like skyrim with guns - ign 10/10 seriously, this is a great game!",1

"play as who ever you want make videos and awesome pictures and download things from the work shop you can make what ever you desire in garrys mod",1
"garrys mod, oh garrys mod, what can you say? i still miss bridge building from 9, seriously what happened? and what about watermelon racing? that was great. so any way, its basically a sandbox game, anything really goes but theres also gamemode maps and mods. some are as fun as putting a fork in your eye, others you will instantly love (ttt rocks!). just beware this game attracts trolls like flies to crap.",1
"pros:: guud graphics gud story gamplay is legit cons; i hass one error sign on prp huntt i gtt bannd on ttt server oldman tpose is stupid",1
"this game is just awsome because being so creative or paly with others is fun for every one",1
"you can either use this for good, or for evil. you could build awesome mansions, play prop hunt, or roleplay, or you could make ragdolls do weird poses, rdm, and prop kill. either way is still fun. 999666420911/10",3

"you should totally buy this funny sandbox game to play with your friends or just have fun with addons",1
"this game is the best game of all games because it is all games and more",1
"i used to love this game. it was so awesome with all the cool addons. but now it crashes constantly and the game just feels so rushed in this new version. i cant play any servers anymore because they all keep crashing and the ones i do manage to join just crash in 15 minutes. some of the textures mess up sometimes and every time i verify the games (not even worthy of game status anymore) cache integrity it just keeps saying 2 files are failed to validate every time. this game has become so broken. i dont even know gmod anymore it used to be awesome but now its just ruined. and i am so mad that i am going to call this game a pile of . not worth the money anymore not even worth a free to play. garry i want my money back! do not buy this game",4
"well, this game is a combo of two things i love,addons and pysics that dont even work!. now i reccomend this because steam said i should.",1
"its good but i got a new screen and it stoped working",1

"i dont think ive ever played a game longer than garrys mod. ever since gmod 9 i have been building various interests of the mind and playing so many different gamemodes that this game should be considered multiple games in one. although the community isnt as strong today as it was, there is no better place to make a server with friends and build random creations to the hearts content. (or until one of your friends blows your  up) i should also mention the better part of the online community now is made up of rpers or people playing trouble in terrorist town.",4
"you can never have a dull moment in g-mod! so much to do and so much to see!",2

"its gmod if you dont already have it, why dont you? everyone should own it",2
"the just randomly disappeared and now i cant find it or play it!",2
"fun and entertaining. each game mode may be difficult to understand at first, but after a while you get the hang of it. the only downside to it is that it is difficult to play if you do not have the textures for the maps if you do not have the files for them. other than that it is a great game to buy and play with friends",2
"pretty much if you have a steam account you should have this game by now.",1
"its a really good game also i like the cars the mods everything about it so if you see this garry good job!!!",1

"this is actually a pretty good game. you can mess around with random objects on random game maps, or even play some prop hunt or trouble in terrorist town. :) but to load the maps correctly, youre gonna need some source engine games such as: tf2, l4d2, hl2, cs:s, and portal (most importantly cs:s) in order to play prop hunt or other mods or youll have errors around the whole map (you can still play tho). in sandbox mode (messing around with items), you can always load the map. 8/10",1
"garrys mod is pretty endless, the amount of content it has is like rule 34:if it exists, someone has made an addon for it. both serious and more game-like roleplay, fps combat, tactical combat, building, screwing around, theres so much you can do in this.",5

"with 100+ hours i think i can rate this , i recommend it because its incredibly fun to play with friends and everyone is relativly nice. if you have other games such as tf2 , css , portal , you get some extra maps and props to mess around and blow things up in! if you dont have this gamei feel sorry for you, so buy it , now :d",1

"this game is crazy, theres a million features and youll never learn them all. does it matter? no, because its a sandbox game and you can do whatever suits your interests. i personally enjoy building floating, rocket propelled, exploding smoke-emitting nets of pure fps-killers. pick it up, even if you wait till a sale, its a ton of fun. plus, theres a ton of modded game modes you can play, like slenderman-style games, or assault the base, etc etc...",1

"this game is amazing. theres hundreds of gamemodes and you never get tired of one gamemode.i am disapointed in one thingh though, without counter strike force, the games almost useless. almost ever model involes counter strike unfortunatley, so if you plan on getting the lengendary g-mod, then be sure to buy the package of counter stike force + garrys mod.",1
