"counter-strike 1.6. not one of the best, nor one of the worst.  good gameplay   bad graphics, as it was launched in 1999  if youre going to buy this game at this time, i suggest buy counter-strike: global offensive. (7/10)",1

"whenever i play this game i have the urge to go back to high school then smoke some dank buds and tell my mom to go to hell. linkin park 4 ever.",1
"!!! its the best online game i played, it can make joy for you and your friends, also you can play with your friends. when all the players die, you are lonely, you have to fight for another enemies, all the teammate put the hopes on yourself, and you will never forget that feels!",3
"just awesome ^ every part of it + modes + every single map of guns, deathrun, knife, bhoping, climbing etc. 100 % fun + addiction xd thumbs up ^",1
"get this game if you love repeatedly hearing sounds of fire in the hole!, not respawning after you die and having to deal with players hundreds of times better than you when you first begin playing. if you enjoy a game of frustration with a terrible community who will look down on you for not having reflexes like a cyborg, this is the right game for you. also, if you dont already have this game, you are a . please either buy it or leave steam immediately.",3
"yes...i have done it...and at last i wana say this game is like a drug addiction.many ways to play in this game clan,pub,gungame,base bulding abd all kind of zombie games...simply i like clan play...its not enough to give your 100% in game..you have to do more better...this game is really awsm...i have no words to describe the game cs 1.6 specially",5
"awesome game,i use to play cz before but now i realized cs 1.6 is by far the best game i ever played",1
"i got banned from this game in 2002 by vac just because i logged in from a computer with hacks installed in a lan shop. it has been 11 years since i was banned and i still cant play counterstrike with my account. i am already 25 this year, even prisoners in democratic nations are given 2nd chance but not steam. shameful!",1
"cs 1.5 or 1.6 was the birth place for me, to be a pc gamer - 10/10 !!",1
"over a decade later and this game is still the most-played game on steam and for good reason; solid gameplay, controls, user-generated maps and mods; the list goes on. this fps personally serves as a model of comparison whenever i play any other first-person games.",1
"~|^kn!ghtm@re^|~ auto-mix server 103.2.238.234:27015 all the cs fans are welcomed..!",2
"i grow up on cs 1.6, but now it is unplayable. a lot of garbage on servers a lot of music and useless things. low download speed, and everybody hack everywhere. please make something with this game, just need some patch, for disable downloadable contetn, and useless things...",1
"in the 80s my tape-mate richard d. reynalds disappeared down my extra 8-track speakers clutching opiate presciptions and blues mixtapes. i remembered his parting words: fuc k john coltranes newphew -- id tear my pseudo goldfish in that flyinglotus-eater. take my taxi-card, im off. but three avenues deep, i regarded his winter jackettas nothing more than a sony stance. my first-draft redeemer is a real vb! wow!! and dont pose me a steam, you neglector flying aphex! true macho what did we teach?ageispolis is famous for its slow-burning ziggurat. check it, mountain-chair gig at 2!!!",1
"cool game. i like it because of bhop, knife, and zombie mod on modded servers",1
"this game is byfar one of the best fps game i have ever played! i remember when i used to play this on the original xbox and had so much fun playing it. i was really sad when my controller broke and i couldnt play it anymore but soon after that i got the xbox 360 and started to play cod and gta. then, i started playing on pc and all i played was minecraft until i downloaded steam and i found counter strike. i had no idea it would come with cs:cz so i decided to play it and it was more fun than cs. i enjoy to play this game and im sure that i will continue to love this game!",1
"best game ever, the graphics may not be the best, but who cares, i still love it as hell!",1
"if you were a fan of this game back in the day youll feel nostalgic and want to buy it but dont, it doesnt hold up if youve done any gaming of any sort since then.",1
"this game is unlike the other counter strike games. this game requires a different type of skill. you have to become used to the recoil each weapon has. you also have to become familiar with the different advantage points of each map. i personally think this is the best counter-strike game.",1
"counter-strike is one of those games that still has people playing on servers 15 years later and probably still will due to its addictive and competitive gameplay. strongly recommend it. 10/10",1
"nice game, great gameplay, graphics is poor as hell",1
"still one of the best games ive played on the computer",1
"this is one of my favourite games. it is simply classic game. i really enjoy playing this game",2
"the only way to get subjected to terrorism that isnt the news. or living in the middle east,ukraine, and most of africa.",1
"for some reason running counter strike source and exiting makes the computer think its playing cs but other than that good game although i probably only played for 533 seconds rather than 533 hours",1
"how to be cs:go pro 1. buy c-s 2. launch it up and leave it on for 2 weeks straight 3. get over 100 hours of c-s and then brag about it on your next cs:go comp game how you played with the best pros back in the day 10/10 still best game and s better than cs:go",1
"i havent played it that much but i can say that its a really good game!",5
"a must-have. this is the granddaddy of online shooters. get it.",1
"a game in which you can always come back too. with cs go and source also being great games, counter-strike 1.6 is always a classic in my book",4
"this game is very good and is fast paced especially with 30 other people! there is a money system where when you kill someone or do the mission objective you earn money. with that money you can buy guns. powerful weapons are expensive and not as powerful weapons are cheap! there are 2 main game modes but plenty of maps! the players are friendly but competetive! i highly recomend this game.",1
"this game took me away from csgo....this game is amazing.. i really recommend this game even if it isnt good looking all that matters is the gameplay and by far i really liked the gameplay of the original cs",1

"a game for all professional counter-strike players!!",1
"wait... you dont own this game already!? whats wrong with you!? how have you not owned this since its release!? for shame! you might as well just wait for counter-strike: global offensive to come out, since you waited this long to even get counter-strike. im ashamed of you.",1
"the steam is not working and ate my nerve with kumping out of the server no reason after you just entered the game, when you tried to buy something from menu b it just changes map automatically and kepps going until you stuck in some little map with few poeple. change this problem faster or refund me or pay my loss !!!",1
"no killstreak . no regen. health . a real game that takes real skill thats has been out for 14+ years and pepole still play it. a lot. this game will live on forever as a classic. 10/10",1
"without a doubt the best multiplayer game in the universe! will probably stay that way for at least 10 more years!",1
"this game is a must buy. if you dont care about graphics and such, this game is a gem. the community is pretty.. died. atleast the competitive community. anyways, this game is a must buy!",1
"a game which will never bore anyone.. i never tire of playing this game..been 8 years and still counting..life as a cs player rocks..",2

"i really love this game. its one of my favourites. the game mode, those oldish graphics, the fun you can have with it... i met a lot of nice people because of this game, and its sad that most of the servers are full of cheaters now, but you will always find out some good servers even if theres no admins around. one of the best fps ever. 10/10",3
"good game, but keep in mind its hard to find pcw now when cs go came out!",2
"after reinstalling steam all servers are lost!!!!! sometimes cant find servers...",1
"the best realism half-life mod as its the one everyone remembers. causing incalculable rage in dialup users for years and years. if youre bad youre a nub, if youre good youre a hacker, if youre just mediocre then youre just right.",1
"i got flashed four hours ago and i still cant see anything. 10/10",1
"counter strike 1.6.... the game that set the standards of shooters and paved the way for new video games. on my old steam account, i racked at least 1000 hours on counter strike and counter strike condition zero, and all for a good reason, because it is probably one of the best team shooters in the world. 10/10",1
"one of the best online games since last 13 years i guess or 10 i have been playing it for now for past 2 years continuously",1
"it was fun for the little that i played it, is this game active anymore?",1
"cs was the very first fps game i was introduced to (over 10 years ago omg), and ive been in love with it ever since. makes me a lil giddy sometimes, and compared to the graphics and simulation of todays shooters the quality is pretty  (im prepared for some flak), but really, its like that bottle of wine that has aged and mellowed on the beloved alcohol shelf *hic*...nothing can beat the classics. a bottle of the finest chardonnay for this veritable *hic* shooter! and another just for me. *collapses in drunken stupor*",1
"it is so classic and so balanced that you just cant go wrong with counter strike. 5/5",1
"the best game ever. buy this legendary game and play the worlds number 1 online action game. engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. take out enemy sites. rescue hostages. your role affects your teams success. your teams success affects your role. dont think twice buy it . you will not regread.",1
"not b + r friendly. came for the dusters, stayed for the rats. 11/10",1
"probably the greatest team fps that there ever was, was way ahead of its time in all departments. still to this day has full servers full of dedicated players 24-7. to think that it was originally just a half life mod shows that you dont need to spend a fortune to make a great game",1
"the best fps gameplay you can play, playing it since 2008",1
"im getting addicted to this game and so will you if you buy it.",1
"this is a really awesome classic game! if anyone ever played it, she/he will never forget about it! deservers the 8 euros, and also you will get condition zero!",1
"write a review for counter-strike please describe what you liked or disliked about this game and whether you recommend it to others. please remember to be polite and follow the rules and guidelines.",1

"this game is one of the main reasons that steam exists. at first, you might take a look at the graphics and buy cs:s or cs:go instead, but i say get this one first. hours of fun, especially with custom maps.",1
"looking for online gaming.. this is the best solution.. :) .... i have csgo still prefer to play this..",2

"this game is the game that started the counter-strike series. it started as a mod for the game that started it all, half-life. like team fortress, counter-strike became a standalone game after its popularity as a mod. if you enjoy the old half-life engine, goldsrc, and want to play a shooter that doesnt have a complicated story and chapters, counter-strike is the game for you. condition zero is the same game but with a campaign mode that allows you to play with bots and unlock maps as you go.",1

"this game is legendary!!! any online fps fan should play it.",1
"almost 7 years of playing this game and still goin on! i hope it will not die because of global offensive. it will be a good idea to introduce steam achievements/trading cards for it, because its a very played game",1

"ok, this is an internet classic; its been the butt of many meme jokes, but you just cant help getting past the fact that it became an internet classic. with terrorist versus ct matches, weapons that would make your head spin and a variety of game modes and community based maps, cs is just one of those games you cant pass up.",1

"the one and only. back when games had simple mechanics and very little nonsense. remember when a bullet would go where you actually fired it? remember when recoil patterns were easy to understand? remember when it was possible to take a game seriously and become ridiculously good at it? the counter-strike franchise is very much like super smash bros -- they had brawl, we had cs:source and cs:go. lets hope valve decides to play a proper homage to this game in the future much like nintendo did with the new smash bros.",1

"very fun game, graphics are disappointing and just not nice, i personally live in israel, israel has a lot of multiplayer servers and their sons loads admit most enjoyable so it makes up for the graphics ... also has the option to fight against bots you can practice with it or simply pass the time, i wish there was such a nice single player. so in short, if you are looking for a game with many indians, multiplayer servers, easy and fun then this is the game for you!",1
"for lose time, its a really nice and exciting game :d",1
"what can i say? my teenage years were in a large part defined by this game (pity about those hundreds of hours disappearing from record). this game is the reason i made a steam account to begin with. this game made me love online gaming (even if its a tough, one-way love). one of the first breakout e-sports (alongside starcraft) and a significant influence on the fps genre. a piece of gaming history. play it if only for that, and see for yourself.",1
"classic fps! a must-have for every fps player to explore the roots of fps-gaming!",1
"i actually never payed attention to this game due its so old. but some days ago i installed it just to see if its still active and it actually is! thats amazing. nearly 20k still playing this game even though its pretty old. for the time i am playing this game i am in love with it. the community is so nice. you dont get matched-up against  loads of hackers like it is in cs:go atm, its a very fun game to play and i probably will play some hours too.",1
"the graphics are awfull! looks like it was made in 1999 or something like that!",1
"this game is a genuine classic. grew up with it. got over 600 hours on it. loved almost every moment of it (except when i got killed by aim-bot and wallers) but oterwise a great buy. it has its perks and like a trillion mods of which id say 25% are running at any given time from servers worldwide. definitely recommend it to players who like oldschool games.",2
"much goodness. as of sould any valve game be. simple easy to pick up and play but very hard to master. this game and its other similar sequel condition zero have both many mods ranging from football right down to the godly great fureion mod.",1
"play this game, is very good and playble, i recommend",4

"what can i say ? most played fps ever with a reason",1
"counter strike changed the landscape of multiplayer first person shooter. ruthless gameplay, perfect balance contributed towards the creation of a very competitive scene. years later it still stands as one the giants among games. loved and still played by thousands, it has shaped lives and destinies.",1
"i really like the game, but i couldnt find the stupid cake.",3
"without a doubt, in my top 10 games ever. without cs, my life wouldve been a lot different. this game is freaking amazing, and i remember playing hundreds, and hundreds of hours in the 1.6 version. playing dust2, dust, aztec, inferno.... man those were the good days. if youre even checking the reviews out, you should buy it. not because you will be playing it for hundreds of hours now that its old, but just so you can get that vintage feel. like the smell of a vintage t-shirt. 10/10 must have for anyone calling themselves a gamer.",1
"play the worlds number 1 online action game. engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. take out enemy sites. rescue hostages. your role affects your teams success. your teams success affects your role.",1
"if youre looking for fast-paced action, this game is for you.",1
"join a server everyone speaks french get banned for unknown reason 10/10",1
"the most awesome counter-strike game ive ever played",1
"the original fps shooter game. you should also look into counter-strike: source if you like a more modern version.",1
"this game started the fps franchise. well technically it didnt, but it started it for me dammit.",1
"pfff.... nothing much too say the games old odseivly i dont reccomend it anymore but for the time this game was realised it truly shined.",1
"great game to spind late nights with. the time just flies into space and you wake up in another time the future. excelent game then and certainly is now.",1
"did anyone not play this game at some point or another. as elusive to me as football and stock car racing in its ability to transfix the lives and minds of some shall we say, unenlightened gamers out there.",1
"absolutely fabulous. just buy it, if you like true fps games, that require practice bur never get boring, here is one excellent for you.",2
"best tactical fps shooter in the world and the best game valve has ever released i think most people will agree with me and if u dont agree that means you havnt played it yet :) 11/10",1
"this is my favorite game on steam. even though its pretty old its more fun than tf2 and garrys mod.999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999,999/10",1
"the best realism half-life mod as its the one everyone remembers. causing incalculable rage in dialup users for years and years. if youre bad youre a nub, if youre good youre a hacker, if youre just mediocre then youre just right.",1
"this game will always be the best out of all the cs",4
"still a lot of people playing 1.6, lots of fun with a good community.",1

"very good game still, this game is still fantastic, undead <3",4
"this game is a prime example of how a great game tends to pass the test of time. although the graphics are very outdated (graphics arent everything), the gameplay is good enough that the game is consistently on player number charts even after 15 years the original mod was released. be careful: there are a lot of fake servers out there. be sure not to click on those.",1
"one of the best time wasting games! all about ping, fps, and exp.. especially here: classic: 95.172.92.152:27015 auto-mix: 95.172.92.152:27016 do we even have time for this s***?",3
"this game is dosent good when i play on server dosent work and say : time out ",1
"i played this game back in 1.5 before shields and before vac before steam had the gui overlay. im a og cser. had alot of fun scriming using mirc, cal leagues, cevo. retired team ag and clan skj. i blame this game for getting me into a computer profession. haha",1
"without a doubt the best multiplayer game in the universe! will probably stay that way for at least 10 more years!",1
"why cant i run counter strike 1.6? its running half-life and gives me some kind of error message, and then i press ok on that, and it closes down...what the hell?!",3
"best shooter of all times!! been playing it since v. 1.4",1
"simply the legendary mulitiplayer first person shooter. it has now become reduced to thousands of servers full of tens of thousands of counter-terrorist and terrorist bots in a perpetual endless war spamming their radio commands killing each other mainly on de_dust2 the only full servers are ing br spamming the chats u gib me monies or i repot u huhuhuehue hue hue hue jajajajjajajajajja jaja ja ja",1
"by far the best first person shooter ive ever played.",2
"in my opinion, cs is the single greatest first-person shooter ever created. complex, addictive, challenging, intense, precise, and infinitely replayable, cs was the defining game for an entire generation of gamers. but be warned, this game is absolutely brutal if you are new to shooters.",2
"awesome game i ever played! <3 counter-strike is life :* !",1
"one of the, if not the biggest essential to the online fps genre. seriously, any of the cs games are brilliant, but 1.6 will always be my favorite. buy this one if you want to get into the series, for its suprisingly thriving community, and the basic, yet addicting gameplay.",1
"spent so many hours on this game during high school! now that go is out, im playig counter strike more.",1
"the point of counter-strike is... to be the best. this is not a game, this is the game!",1
"a real classic. one of the best first person shooters of all time and my favorite game of all time. this game is so good that it will for sure never die! :d 10/10",1
"cs:go is good. cs is great. i keep on playing, and school i will be late.",1
"this is a great game, i have no problems with this game and it is fun and addictive. also this is my favourite game and even tho it may be hard at first it is still constanlty fun :d",4
"you cant strike a counter, but you can strike other players with a knife. or just constantly get one hit killed by enemies with deagles, aks, and awps.",1
"a real classic game. i lost track about how many time ive spent playing cs",1
"use to be a good game but full of hackers and  servers 10/10 ign",1
"i was pro on this game, really.. + community,mods - cheaters, kids",1
"a great fps game that doesnt need much requirements .",1
"a very fast-paced shooter with great gameolay at the time when it came out, today occupied by a small pack of hardcore counter strikers that will not forgive a single move of the mouse that is slower than theirs.",1
"i just bought a macbook air and for some reason when u get into a game the mouse goes funky on me and wont let me move around properly. its not the mouse either because it works fine until im in a game and it does the same thing with the touch pad on my mac... any suggestions?",1
"best childhood steam game, landed me a $1000 internet bill, mods up the  ing amazing.. still one of the best counterstikes had fights with family just to play! ing 10/10",1
"so much fun. cant explain. thats why i`ll stop the review here. ty",2
"i like this game, because u can do everything in this game.",1
"this game is the best action shooter ever made, its gameplay is very well balanced and you have many options and tactics to do. actually, if you play cs:go, then this game is exactly the same except that the graphics are from 2000. but this does not matter. gameplay is far more enjoyable then graphics! and if steam was built aound this game, well, then it must be some good stuff.",1
"counter-strike can join in with golden eye in taking credit for defining the comman fps game as we know it today. its servers are still active over a decade of entertainment. you customize your gear then choose to either use tactics to disarm the bomb, or you can just rush in like an insane person, grip the hostages by the arm as you say follow me now!!!, and get them to safety. it is pure greatness. and the system requirements are not demanding, so virtualy any computer nowadays can run it.",1
"awesome game truly an nyc game with tactics, guns, different maps, etc",2
"just a good first person shooter. nothing great but for its time its good",1
"17-04-14 new update. game doesnt even open. error: fatal error- cannot load library. please fix. unbale to open cs 1.6",1
"one of the best online games since last 13 years i guess or 10 i have been playing it for now for past 2 years continuously",1

"the best game ever played :) enjoing abou 12 years :) thanks valve",2
"oldest shooter game. were in 2014 and this game is very played.",4
"this game is just as good as it was 10 years ago. its the tetris of fps. you will still find tons of people to play with (half of them annoying kids, just like 10 years ago) and find yourself neglecting your modern games...",1
"old game but still the best and favourite fps shooting games to all the gamers :)",3
"counter-strike is #1 game is world))))))))))))))))))))",2
"awesome game before the update, it will remain one of the best games ive played. all the memories ive had with this game wont leave me thats for sure.",5
"is there really necessary to say something about cs? i dont think so. legendary multiplayer action game that lives for decades!",1
"this game is for gamers who take this seriously. :d",5
"this is an example that the graphics not always matter! awesome game since 2000! rating 9/10 because of losers cheaters.",1
"cradle of all fps multiplayer games for sure!!! played approximately 8 years, spent over 10 000 hours (non steam) during my lifetime, & worth every single minute of playgame !!!! shame, nowadays there arent many good players, so kinda makes it boring !",1
"this game changed gaming as a whole. one of the best fps of all time, if not the best. but its all about the gameplay. its how cs plays that will get you. huge online community, thousands of mods, nostalgic graphics, excellent gameplay, nice sound effects even if they r outdated. cs 1.6 is my favorite fps and is much better than source and global offensive in almost all aspects. i played this game so much before i got steam, this game is just spetacular. even in non-steam gaming, lan houses,competitive play, cs 1.6 is still incredibly popular. 10/10, congratulations to the developers.",1
"best game ever !!!! cs 1.6 > all other cs`s !!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"this game is a classic. i lost many hours of sleep and spent a lot of time playing this game from the 1.1-1.6 clients of this game. 1.3 will always have a place as my favorite time i played the game. still love to pub with friends.",1
"its counter-strike you point gun and shoot terrorists (or counter-terrorists if you prefer the ak) just dont cross the streams",1
"best game ever..... so many fun times, great fps, worth way more than it costs! its just great!",1
"this game really proves that graphic does not matter but gameplay does...cs 1.6 <3",3
"i spent 1200 hours on testing plugins i made. 10/10",4
"having only played csgo for the past year or so, it is really nice to see what that game was rooted off of. i now know playing 1.6 what all the hype about counter strike is and the history behind it. 1.6 for its time period was such a benchmark game. really awesome!",1
"check out the real one! not the ones, where they increased movement speed. the hardcore-game.",1
"probably thats been 7 years since the last time i played 1.6, and im glad that i made the decision to buy it again and have fun with the old gal. everything is such a great and nostalgic experience. i dont even wanna touch the cs:go right now unless my friends ask me for a pre-made team.",1
"after many years of being out. by far one of my favorite games. ive purchased it many times for myself and friends. even tho the graphics are shakey. with a decent modern computer and recent hd features this game looks remarkable. the physics in this game are remarkable, relastic and complicated. its a hard game to get a grasp off, but now that you cannot just spray at ones head and get head shots. this game alongside dota, and starcraft. were pioneers in online competitive play and this game should recieve high acolades for its contribution to esports.",1
"an original classic and the king of competitive multiplayer. only for hardcore pc gamers.",1
"awesome game, but is dead. every pro player migrated to cs:go, which is a cs 1.6 with upgrades and nice graphics!",4

"after more than a decade im still playing this game.. that has to say something.. :) it pwns..! ^_^",1
"this game is still popular ! i recommend it to everyone!",1
"this is the worst star wars game i have ever played. theres no force powers, lightsabers, clones, droids, nothing. its like they took out every element that would be in a star wars games. this would only be the best game if they later renamed it to counter strike or something along those lines.",1
"valve please make sequels to this game. maybe try the source engine.",1
"if you want to play an fps that will slaughter your butt and make you rage so hard you can punch a tiger in the face, this game is for you. only the best can survive this game, youll be playing against people whos reflexes are faster than bruce lee hyped up on red bull. if you are a person who thinks he/she is good at fpss and want a challenge, buy this game. your self esteem will drop further than an emo in prison after dropping the soap. i highly recommend this game!",1
"must buy, if u havent played cs, den u have played nothing (y)",2
"i get my  wooped by people who have been playing since electricity was discovered.",1
"it was the lol of fps during quakes heyday, funny how its considered hardcore now the sounds of any west coast us server is like going to a working class latino neighborhood eyy foo they all goin b wtf  fucc u chu wana fite holmes??",1

"no good quality servers, and most people are hackers or get a cracked version of the game and threaten to ddos you. get cs:cz, cs:s, or cs:go because they have bots to play with if you cant even find a server. might have been good 15 years ago but now it has been left to rot.",1
"a classic that everyone needs to have played at least once.",1
"i stil play this game today its that good, anyone who dont have this game should get it immediately!",1
"hi >> where the d3d mode??? i dont have it ?? only open gl and sofrware???",1
"there is a huge lump in my throat as i edit this review. if you own this game and reading reviews for fun, keep scrolling. so this game is only mp without mods and its dying atleast here in my country(india) and its $10 which is way too expensive in terms of our currency. get the physical copy of counter-strike anthology from a local/online retailer which will have half the price of this game alone without any sale! rip counter-strike 1.6 :(",1
"if you like counter strike source but hate the gun physics, try this game. still a bunch of people playing after all these years",1
