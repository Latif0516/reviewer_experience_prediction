"this is an all-time favorite of mine. counter-strike has changed my life forever. it has instilled keen sense of awareness. cs helped train my reaction timing as well as my accuracy overall. i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a fps. finally fast, finally! word of advice for any first person shooter : -always keep your crosshair(if you use one) at head level. -when exploring, keep in mind the layout of the area & always try to place your crosshair where you think the enemy is going to be. (being ready is key)",2
"best first person shooter to ever surface on to a pc or console. counter strike 1.6 is an old game but still very popular amongst pc gamers everywhere in the world. there are many clans and communities that still support this game, so its not hard to find a group of friends that enjoy playing. you can find various moded servers that include warcarft 3, call of duty moder warfare 3, zombies, american football, prop hunt, paint ball and many more!",4

"its ing counter-strike. what are you reading this for? buy it already.",1

"if you havent played it yet your not really a gamer!",2

"a classic in the genre. still a lot of players playing it. not the best looking multiplayer fps out there, but very fun to play.",1

"i really liked this game because its very good, many many servers and players you can play with i have some experience,but more memories when i first started to play this game. so i recommend it!!!!! to all its not some strong game that you will be in lag or your computer is weak and you cant on this game,so this game is very small and everyone can play it!",1

"hours of gameplay, tons of fun, amazing when played with a great team that uses communication to its fullest. i recommend this to anyone who likes fps games and team-based games.",1
"the greatest multiplayer shooter experience ive had since quake 1. the e-sport scene also helped it alot, its the only computer game ive really followed when it comes to e-sports (back when i followed the cpl etc). the design of the game was simple but very effective and delivered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. the call of duty and battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like counter-strike.",2
"theres a reason why over 15,000 people still play it after 15 years.",1
"counter-strike 1.6 is a wicked fps multiplayer game to play on. very much fun. played this when i was a young kid. and well still do at this day now :) very great game! one of the best pc games if i must say. :)",1
"im just here to post the 6,666th review for this game... get it.",1
"counter strike 1.6.... the game that set the standards of shooters and paved the way for new video games. on my old steam account, i racked at least 1000 hours on counter strike and counter strike condition zero, and all for a good reason, because it is probably one of the best team shooters in the world. 10/10",1
"the first and possibly the best counter stirke. over a decade later and still thousands play it a day? other than nintendo nobody has been able to master something like this as well as it is here. with a huge install base, small game but wonderful gameplay, this is worth your $10",1
"the best game ever :) fun,friends and really good time :3",2
"best classic game that ive been playing for years, if it wasnt for cal falling apart, the release of other verisons of counter-strike such as condition zero, source, and global offense. i would still be playing competitivly",5
"great shooting game :) still one of my favorit shooting games",1
"awesome game, but is dead. every pro player migrated to cs:go, which is a cs 1.6 with upgrades and nice graphics!",7
"the game that started it all! cs 1.6 will always be my favourite multiplayer game. this game has been played by millions of gamers and it still holds a special place in our hearts!",1
"grew up with cs. highly recommended as a parental figure replacement.",1
"the best fps games i have ever played. it has over 15 years old but even that it still keeps the level of gameplay. a lot of modes and free dlcs made by players makes this game even more amazing. i dont regret hours spend on playing this one.",7
"very fun game, graphics are disappointing and just not nice, i personally live in israel, israel has a lot of multiplayer servers and their sons loads admit most enjoyable so it makes up for the graphics ... also has the option to fight against bots you can practice with it or simply pass the time, i wish there was such a nice single player. so in short, if you are looking for a game with many indians, multiplayer servers, easy and fun then this is the game for you!",2
"counter-strike...a game which is a true fps and is one of my favourite shooters",1
"best game you can get on steam, but it was better on won.",1
"steam, wtf... cd update screw my fps ... really? why? al least an answer...",4
"great game, proving graphics arent everything. recommend buying the game and enjoying the pro experience!",2
"this game has its ups and downs but i cant stand playing it because of this damn resolution. damn. i suggest getting cs:s or cs:go. counter strike original is good but there are no active servers. if youre buying this game you should also go get a subscribtion for esea as well.",1
"awesome game! never had so much fun with any other game!",1
"its not the hours of games that the player ! : p my first fps of 2004..... i gets it wrong with this new account! best game !! 10/10",1
"hi >> where the d3d mode??? i dont have it ?? only open gl and sofrware???",1
"1 of my favorite games and the first game i bought on steam.its worth buy u will never get bored of playing on the servers.",1
"this game is the best shooter game and the game that i liked the most! but there is nothing for non steam players that hack in the servers!",2
"best game i ever played. put so many hours in to this. the clan games climbing the ranks. ah the memories!",1
"it got at least 10 times better love story than twilight and counter-strike: global offensive.",1
"if you pick up this game now, you will most probably get wrecked by people who have mastered the game. just a warning. bloody good game though.",1
"this game is very unique, but after february 2013 updates this game no longer fun to play because of new bugs that valve added.",9
"an old cs 1.6 game that almost every gamer played.",6

"best game evaaahh! buut, cs:go can be the same enjoyable and fun! :d",1
"classic game. its great. what more can i say? 9/10. everyone should own this.",1
"a very fast-paced shooter with great gameolay at the time when it came out, today occupied by a small pack of hardcore counter strikers that will not forgive a single move of the mouse that is slower than theirs.",1
"+ competetive. easy to play. can include ai for training. tons of servers/server plugins/custom maps/even custom guns. fun to play, always. - little repeating. in overall, i recommend it to everyone, please do not judge this game for graphics and/or lack of military actions, goldsrc engine is not real virtuality 3 ( arma 2 engine ), and this game is old school, typical classic so graphics are what they are.",2
"oh counter-strike... if you dont have this game then where have you been the last 15 years -_- (also its my personal favorite fps)",1
"do i need to say why do i recommend this? because this is freakin awesome! thats why...!",1
"i like this game! playing since i was 8! played a lot... fine graphics and other stuff.. no.1 game in fps world!!",1
"get on my level.... one of the best fps games, the 1.6 version will stay always in our hearts. i recommend it for everyone who wants a tactical/action shooter games!! :)",5
"this is not a game but a religion, a way of life. if you are not upto the competetion better stay away from it.",5
"ok, this is an internet classic; its been the butt of many meme jokes, but you just cant help getting past the fact that it became an internet classic. with terrorist versus ct matches, weapons that would make your head spin and a variety of game modes and community based maps, cs is just one of those games you cant pass up.",1
"its old and the graphics are outdated... but screw that! this is really fun to play, even though there are tons of pros",1
"shoots at guy 1 health i die cs unistalled installs farming simulator lives life as a farmer the end",1
"can enter only original, new mode surf ski server manages a unique mode who publishes a candidate for admin ielhhh join now =] 84.94.214.173:20889 $$$$$$ cs 1.6 $$$$$$",7
"a still alive first-person shooter, since 2000. the game that changed everything, along with half-life. still, the best first-person for thousands. and you know why? because this games focus isnt on graphics. its for having fun with your friends, or, even aim for world turnaments. all proffesional teams, such as fnatic, navi, sk, still play counter-strike, doesnt matter if it is 1.6, source or global offensive. highly recommend this game.",8
"a friend of mine just gave me his xbox, with a copy of this game. i was happy!",1
"i got banned from this game in 2002 by vac just because i logged in from a computer with hacks installed in a lan shop. it has been 11 years since i was banned and i still cant play counterstrike with my account. i am already 25 this year, even prisoners in democratic nations are given 2nd chance but not steam. shameful!",1
"this game is byfar one of the best fps game i have ever played! i remember when i used to play this on the original xbox and had so much fun playing it. i was really sad when my controller broke and i couldnt play it anymore but soon after that i got the xbox 360 and started to play cod and gta. then, i started playing on pc and all i played was minecraft until i downloaded steam and i found counter strike. i had no idea it would come with cs:cz so i decided to play it and it was more fun than cs. i enjoy to play this game and im sure that i will continue to love this game!",1
"this game is a legend and everyone who has a computer knows it. hours of playing and still lots of fun... the older it is... the better...",1
"this game teaches people why graphics dont matter.",3
"far, the best shooter ever, css and csgo arent the same!",4

"its cs1.6 and your on steam, if you dont have this then please follow these steps: 1. uninstall steam. 2. kill yourself.",1
"this is one of the best acion games i have ever seen til date and is famous than any other game . you ll be a good gamer if get this one.",4
"just the best game ever, im glad i spended thousand and thousand of hours playing this game <3",2
"what if you couldnt even move more than one step from spawn without getting one shotted? what if you got kicked for no apparent reason from a server?? what if you wouldnt even bother to buy this bullcrap, since its exactley like other cs games??????!???! this game sucks harder than monkeyballs getting sucked into a vacuum cleaner or not. i just dont like it.",1
"i cant get the game to work it starts but i dont se the load screen i just see black",1
"no fps game will ever come close to the original counter-strike. its a shame the days when everyone played it are gone.",3
"revolutionary new game for 2012, better graphics than cod",1
"very old game, but is still one of the best fps games ever. this is accepted as the best counter strike ever and i can agree. the mechanics feel great and the weapons are all very fun to use. rating 10/10 chris",1

"this is my very first game that i played on steam, counter-strike. this game brings back good memories. very addicting. its probably the only game that people are playing today on that isnt running off from a source engine. if you never played counter-strike 1.6 before, try it out. its one of the best fps game of all time. if you dont like it, well, you didnt paid alot of money for it.......or did you?",1
"screen problems.. it is sucking up.. cant put back the screen in original way after it gotten wider.. no opption at all.",1

"old but gold! simple mechanics, lots of mods, and a great game to blow off some steam.",1
"the one, the original: call of duty. do you suffer from irregularity? borderlands will fix that for you. this game, called garrys mode, will blow your  through your mouth and make you suck it. if youre already not good, itll turn you into a in dinosaur. the possibilities are limitless. now youre thinking with portals, jerk.",1

"you should know this... it is the game to change all games of its type. it will be a part of my gaming forever!",1
"i dont currently have much hours on the game but from a beginers standpoint its a really solid game. just has a pretty steep learning curve and i still die more than i kill but when you do kill someone its pretty cool that guy has to wait like 3 minutes before he can play again. 8/10",1
"counter strike is one of the best first person shooter in the whole world, its so funny to play hns and other gamemodes! yes i recommend this awesome game! 10/10 little cats!",1

"good, old counter strike! one of the must play games.",1
"a classic and always will be! must get for classic game lovers!",1
"possibly one of the greatest first person shooting games ever made. try it out and see how you like it. too bad that numerous number of hackers are around these days, but not a probem if server admins are present. you can try maps like dust/dust2, assault, or even fy maps like snow and iceworld. awp maps are also great if you like scoping and killing opponents with one shot. maybe even go for some of the fun surfing maps that are still around. lastly, fyi it does take some time to find the optimal sensitivity setting that you play the best with.",1
"counter-strike is one of those games that still has people playing on servers 15 years later and probably still will due to its addictive and competitive gameplay. strongly recommend it. 10/10",1
"the original and possibily still the best (minus the riot shields). if you love nostalgia as much as i do, and you dont own this game but used to play it at lan cafes maybe? get it already!",1
"the best game in the world, the jipiroca is going pew pew.",6
"best online shooter ive played also because you can mod it for fun. this game takes more skill than a multitude of other games and for anyone to ever miss out on this game is doing a complete disservice to onesself note to get the original onscreen multiplayer skins set the game models to not be hd in the video options menu",1
"the classic genre-defining fps. counter-strike may be 16 years old but there are thousands of servers with an overflowing amount of players. the difficulty curve is no joke. but once you get used to it, you never get tired of tea-bagging dead players after a headshot. since it is only multiplayer, you get practically infinite replayability. 8/10 - a big heavy dose of fun",1
"only skill important in this game. i liked this game :>",1
"classic superb multyplayer game, but till steam the hot air is out. is it the servers? the players? the stupid fan-mods? i dont know....",1
"ive spend bajilion hours on this one. best game from the series imo. remember its not all about the graphics - gameplay is what matters. 8/10",1

"funnest game ever, still has competetive pug servers. lots of fun. =)",1
"revolutionized fps gaming & pretty much made it what it is today. literally was the greatest fps games back in the day.",1
"all i see when i play this game is bots. i never liked counter strike very much, because i wasnt into the way the game was played, and also the money system kind of confused me. it seemed to me like if one team won two or three matches in a row, they were able to have complete domination over the other team and that just isnt fun. and maybe its because i wasnt there for this games glory days, but source and global offensive just seem so much more superior. so im gonna say pass on this game in favor of the two newer versions that have all of the same content but with more.",1
"back to old fps game? yeah this is the best! counter strike is the best online fps game i think..",1
"game from my childhood. 10/10 fun. 10/10 mods cs 1.6 is not dead!",2
"legendary game with absoludly fantastic gameplay :) i spent about 2000h on nonsteam version of this game and then i bought it, becose i got a respect to the developers and becose i loved and i still love this game. 11/10 there wont be any same and great game as 1.6.",1
"its counter strike, the whole reason steam even exists!",1
"without a doubt the best multiplayer game in the universe! will probably stay that way for at least 10 more years!",1
"one of the best multiplayer games out there right now. fun, strategic gameplay. best played with a couple friends or a full team of people that you can communicate with.",1
"better than source, better than go. but for some reason, people always prefer graphics over actual balanced gameplay.",1
"fire in the hole. fire in the hole. fire in the hole. fire in the hole. stick together team. stick together team. stick together team. team, fall back! fire in the hole.",1
"its counter-strike you point gun and shoot terrorists (or counter-terrorists if you prefer the ak) just dont cross the streams",1
"hello. i play this game for more than 14 years and still happy and would be grateful for your gift to me in the new year game counter-strike 1.6 thanks :)",1
"if you join the army or some special force, you have to buy your own gear. the heck?",1
"the good old counterstrike never seems tiring and boring. i still play it till date alongwith counterstrike : global offensive. valve should release update for the remaining bugs and glitches and revamp the graphics keeping the gameplay same.",4
"one of the best shooter games ever ! you must buy it !",2
"well if you think  game, graphics,iy weapons,you are a very crazy person.this game yes its an  game but its fun so no give any crap.dont buy it on 9.99 dolars buy it on when sales like 2.49 and 4.99 dolars.great game for relax.recommending!",1

"everybody get up, its time to slam now we got a real jam goin down welcome to the space jam heres your chance, do your dance at the space jam, alright",1
"best call of duty community simulator with old outdated graphics so far.",1
"every counter-strike is a must buy. not only are they all really fun, but it is really interesting to see the progression of them. 1.6 is the start of the series, and i thoroughly recommend looking up and downloading the original beta maps from 1999 like docks as they were originally part of the game (although most of them removed due to unfair map design [except docks]). cs 1.6 is a fun game, but if you arent interested in playing older games then i wouldnt bother, source and global offensive are newer and more replay-friendly games.",1
"oh! the classic counter-strike... the first and best fps ive played. it just brings sooo many memories playing with friends, so many laughs, etc.. if youve never played cs, please, just quit life!",1
"one and only the best game ever played... those who agree please like this.... xd..... -get_right",1
"the granddad of all shooters! this game is the definition of excellent. this game may be old, but its still a great game to play. also, its really cheap!",1
"really nice game! a must buy! its has to feature in your library surely!",1
"if you didnt play this but play cs:go, you probably like to pretend you did.",1
"what better way to play an fps than the original? this game paved the way for all modern day fps with out this we wouldnt have things like call of duty. i have been playing this since i was a child and still love it 100/10",2
"this game is basically just cod with bad graphics. i rate it 10/10",1
"i havent played counter strike in years. this game is still a classic and there are plenty of players to play with. if youve played a counter strike game.. this one is always a good one to get into now and then. havent had any problems with it, people complained a lot in bad reviews about hackers and such... that is bound to happen but not nearly as much people seem to portray. great game check it out.",2
