"excellent game. i bought it for the 360 first, but once the steam sale came around i picked it up for the pc. add a few mods and its pretty much a whole new game! 10/10",1
"get wanted for killing a chicken simulator 2015 10/10 would kill chicken again.",1
"a good game with a lot of things to do. the main storyline is a bit lacking and the sidequests dont always stay interesting although there are more than enough to keep you playing the game for hours. you will het hours of enjoyment out of this title if you enjoy the world it puts you in but the repetitive combal and inconsistent stories may drive you away from the game as it did for me after a while. dont get me wrong, i loved the game while i was playing it but i did eventually get bored of it because of the many flaws it has.",1
"the modding is so insane that you end up spending most of your time modding instead of playing the game. 10/10 would mod again",1
"very fun, more simplified, rpg. i like stealth. this is unhelpful, i know, sorry.",1
"best star wars sim ive ever played. caint wait till count dooku expansion drops.",1
"the game of the year for pc (2011). good, story, good graphics, great music and really a big world to discover. a must have.",1
"this game is wonderful! it has a great idea of being able to trek the snowy mountains or dirt roads but, its very laggy on my computer. i have an intel dual core 2.1 ghz processor, 4gb of ram, more than enough memory, an ok graphics card but it still lags. oh well :) ive got it on my xbox :)",1
"this game never ends. never. you just keep playing and playing. this game is addicting and sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much fun. i would recommend this game to all my friends. :)",1
"killed a dragon. made a hat out of its corpse. ten outta ten.",1
"this game has stolen my life, and given me several new ones in return. immersion is key. excellent game, with an expansive modding community. highly recommend.",3
"played it. beat it. loved it. buy it. try it. (   )",1
"skyrim is not perfect, but it is a hell of a good time. with two amazing dlc expansions and countless mods skyrim delivers hundreds upon hundreds of hours of content. with the right combination of mods you can shape and form skyrim to your liking and make it just about any genre of game you want. a must buy",1
"2 years on and ive reinstalled it on my new rig. for me, still the standout first person proper rpg, and now at last it looks extra fab! big like space. big like those americans they visit on superskinny vs supersize. its the same folk as do fallout these days, and they clearly looked at that and thought not big enough, not enough content. then they released extra stuff. and let the community make more content too! oh, and its really good too! genuine choices in disputes that changes how useful npc folk behave. and as its single player, you can play it your way. arcade it up and exploit everything you can after reading a wiki - fine, your game. role play it, fine. or my favourite - craft everything, find evrything, complete everything. heres hoping they keep the online version as close as possible to this work of genius.",1
"amazing game! especially with all the mods you can get!",1
"oh skyrim, with your wondrous landscapes and your lovely wildlife and inhabitants. skyrim is an excellent game with so much to do. become a thief, a warrior, anything you wanna be. you can do all the quests you want or go around each town and slaughter everyone. the possibilities are (relatively) endless. my only qualm about the game is the menu system in-game. it seems a little clunky at times and annoying having to scroll through heaps of items sometimes just to get one thing. luckily there are mods out there for that, and i definitely recommend them should you feel the same way",1
"this game is exactly the kind of game i needed. i needed to feel like the hero. i needed to be the one man/woman army that can kill dragons with my voice but also start a family and provide for them. it let me live the life i wanted to live with very little limitations.",3
"walking simulator, bug machine, stupid quests, dancing shadows, delay at shooting arrows, bandits stronger than dragons, flat characters, useless skills, boring books, more stupid quests, repetitive dungeons, slow horses, bad ia, boring dialogues, useless powers... etc etc. alright, there is one positive aspect, there are mods that can change the game from bad to less bad, but still bad. and yes, half of my hours invested in this game have been trying to solve problems or testing mods. if you are looking for a walk on beatiful landscapes, this is your game.",1
"awesome game 10/10 gota have a good pc to run it tho",1
"you can be batman with a lightsaber, your argument is invalid.",1
"skyrim... possibly one of the most talked about games at where i work, where my brother is educated, and nearly every corner of the internet. *contains spoilers: do not read unless you already know/dont care* after you create your character, choosing from a decent amount of races to choose from, youre head is officially on the chopping block. literally. before your near-trip to oblivion, a dragon (something that the nords of skyrim think is no more than a legend) pretty much saves you... while trying to murder everything within hells half acre. after running to safety, you are pushed to try and survive, thanks from some help of an imperial solider (whos name is not remembered....) who then makes a mutual-survival pact with you in the helegen keep. utilize some nearby armour and a weapon (and depending on what race you choose, some magic. all races start with flames and healing. others have bonus spells) you set on a complete escape. after a while of fending off stormcloaks, spiders, and other things, you meet the light that is freedom. from here on, your destiny is to slay the dragons. once and for all. how you get there... is up to you. 10/10",1
"10/10 > killed a dragon with my bare fists while naked",1
"must own. played the crap outta my 360 version, and with a good pc and especially the legendary edition its soooooooooooo much better",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a massive, gorgeous singeplayer game that was born with replayability, only to have its legendary status be increased by the addition of thousands of easily accessible mods.",1
"endless fun blowing things off cliffs with unrelenting force. the rest of the game is even better. 90/10",1
"amazing game! - great open world to explore - lots of things to collect - very immersive experience - great modding community 9/10",1
"perhaps the best rpg i have played and the expansions are well worth playing through as well.",1
"this game is one of the best games you will ever play and well worth your money. skyrim pulls you into its world and never lets you go, with its amazing open world and its fun missions so theres never a dull moment.skyrim also has some great dlc wich is awesome and will take even more of your free time.this was the best game of 2011 and one the best games of all time and i would recommend it to any one . if you like skyrim take look at some of bethesdas other games like dishonored or one of the other elder scrolls games they are all amazing.",1
"easily the best game of 2011 and possibly the best rpg of all time!",1
"skyrim is so addicting that my brother now hates me for getting him addicted.",2
"without this game, you will be missing out. nothing has been like this, the exploration, leveling system and the many quests you can do will keep you busy for a while. get this now.",3
"skyrim is an expansive high fantasy adventure containing hundreds of hours of content and some of the most interesting self-directed role playing opportunities available to date. while the main story arc fails to deliver on its early promises of grandeur and scope, the heart of skyrim lies in meandering off the beaten path and making your own tales with the environments and tools available to you. with the addition of the steam workshop, skyrim can become any game you want it to be, from hardcore survival sim to ridiculously overpowered rotflstomper. i would highly recommend grabbing a copy for $50 or less, nabbing the dlc while its on sale and diving in if you have any interest whatsoever in 1st-person fantasy gaming.",1
"its a very good game if you are into adventure action and rpg i recomend it its really fun!",1
"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",1
"i dont know but i find this game very clunky on controls & movement..looks great but i wouldn`t say it the best rpg ever cos it def not. tbh i found it more boring than wanting to play it. better rpg`s out thier than this.",1
"amazing game. but be patient because its long. not recommended for adults with kids. meant for single guys and those that have a lot of free time.",1
"dovakhiin, you are the mightiest of all, the best of the best, (unless you kill a chicken) you slaughter dragons no problem, and you murder every good and bad monster, with a wide array of weapons, spells, and shouts, this easily outsells other crap games. be an assassin, knight or a dangerous magician, who knows. with almost full mod compability, you just cant stop playing! 9.5/10, some bugs still remain (and 1 of them is gamebreaking) but, download the unofficial patches, and most of them are awaaaay.",1
"skyrim is a great game, but it suffers from a lack of intersting quests and places to go to. the overworld is great, but absolutely everything else is shallow in comparison to the world in oblivion. oblivion whilst having some horrible dialogue and poor implementation of the radiant ai for npcs that was so touted, had fantastic cities, dungeons, and an incredible array of interesting quests. some of which sound incredible when compared to skyrim. example: in oblivion you are tasked with attending a house party where you must assassinate each guest one by one without the other guests knowing. quite a bit of fun, with an optional bit that also allows you to flex your silver tongue when people start accusing you. in skyrim you are told of an island where people hunt each other down for sport. so. you must go to a cave filled with dragurs exactly like the one you went through at the beginning of the game to get the prize money. the imagination is just gone. id highly reccomend it. but id reccomend oblivion over it, and morrowind over that.",1
"skyrim is really a milestone in open-world rpgs. its one of the most captivating games so far and i for one played for hours on end. you have hundreds of stories for your character to choose from, and thousands of opportunites await to be discovered in the this vast land. and with the creation kit and steam workshop, you can really let your imagination flow.",2
"i love this game, one of the biggest benefits to the pc version is that you can get mods to enhance the gameplay beyond the original. if you are smart and avoid the mods that are game breaking and just go for the ones that add depth to character dialog or raise the graphics to next-gen levels, or adds new areas to explore, then it has so much more replay value.",1
"what can i say about skyrim that hasnt been said already? nothing. i will simply recommend it. oh and go to the workshop and find some mods that enhance the game. there are many. avoid silly mods that more or less allow you to cheat. cheating in skyrim ruins it. trust me.",1
"decent story. decent gameplay. imo dark souls is better, but this is by no means bad. lovely graphics.",1
"easily scores on my top 10 games of all time, a brilliant action rpg that provides a true nonlinear experience. the game does not give a sh*t when sully your reputation. friendly fire exists and even crucial plot members can die or hate you. this gives you amazing opporunities to be a complete  or a god send to the people of skyrim. that gets to my next point on how good the npc system is. coming back to my last point in how you can sully your reputation, you can buy simply talking to them, thats right, many of the npcs have multiple pathways of chatter, this allows an even bigger nonlinear feel than it already has. let us not forget about the epic battles as well. they, are, epic, to avoid spoiling anything thats all im going to say.so overall we have one of the most nonlinear rpg of all time, a somewhat challenging auhority (early game) unlike other open world games i know *cough* gta *cough*. this holds a solid spot of #7 on my top 10 best games of all time.",1
"the elder scrolls series is fantastic, and skyrim is the most technically proficient in the series. the graphics and mechanics are amazing in this game. also, this is the second game i have bought on steam, and i am happy to say that it works great, which is more than can be said about the first game.",1
"story= phenomenal coloring= bland (helps for immersion) modding= amazing replayability= infinite voice acting / sync= spot on graphics= holy $hit its lagging im playing on low final verdict= 9.4/10",1
"no roleplaying fan can pass skyrim. its very atmospheric & immersive. until you fight your first dragon youll  your pants & feel like a mountain of flames after defeating him. the endless options for modding is a additional great feature. hd fruits, more fishes in the sea, some giant bosses in the wilds, new monsters better language integration for german :) rly good game with a hundret of quests and many many playin-hours :)",1
"i always wanted to replay oblivion, but after spending so many hours on my first run through, i could never bring myself to do it again. then comes skyrim. i love this game. so epic and imersive, it creates a world and atmosphere unlike any other game. every time i play i end up getting side-tracked with some cave or another, but that is what i love about skyrim. it would definately be in my top 5 modern games.",1
"officially the mature gamer podcast game of the generation.",1
"amazing game, if you like open world environments then you will love this. the dlc is amazingly well thought out and the adventure never ends.",1
"great game love the quality and gameplay is absolutely stunning great job again bethesda.",1
"addictive took me a while to get into it though, if you havent played it do yourself a favor and do more than the first few missions because they are really boring, one you get started you will want to play this game all day every day",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of my absolutely favorite games. well it is of course a matter of taste what you best like, but i like this game because it is in the middle age and there is magic and knights and stuff like that and that is why i like this freaky awesome game, anyway the game is almost impossible to complete because almost every villager can you do missions for in every city and the graphics is also impressive.",3
"skyrim is definitely one of the best single player game ever made. it has many quests and plots which makes it very addictive for playing. its map is huge, and has lots of interactive places and events, where some of them i didnt find in my first or even second time playing this game. i would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for offline single player expirience, especially if that person is fan of fantasy gaming.",1
"got the game and murdered a family crap now the guards are after me and where the hell is mexico i mean oh yeah 5 stars",1
"i got this game on the ps3 and i couldnt stop playing and i defeated alduin and everything yet i still by this game becauase everytime is a new adventure that will go on for days of your life. plus i shouted at a goat 19/5",1
"really good game if you can ignore the huge amount of arrows crippling your knees.",1
"i dont need to say anything you already know what you need to do.",1
"the only thing that can be better than skyrim is gta5.",1
"wonderful game, excellent replayability, and the various mods give you a lot of options for changing your gaming experience.",1
"800+ hours and i still love playing it, dont buy it for this reason, its an evil, life draining game.",3
"skyrim is a testament to lastability through community, something that can be said for only games like dota, counter strike and wow. for the most part, skyrim serves as a complete rework since oblivion, which is great, because it finally gave people a stable, and pleasant to look at platform to woork with. it has all the great fantasy elements, a solid soundtrack and versatile graphics. things that morrowank could never even hope to obtain, unless it was a mod for skyrim. and this is its lastability, since the advent of the steam workshop (and shortly before, for nexus users), skyrim has been able to outlast most other games by several years through simply adding a handful of mods. it has allowed everyone to create everything ridiculous and stunning, completely rework the game or even, as aforementioned, rework other games (or just fix them, in morrowinds case). if for nothing else, i certainly recommend you download skyrim to have some mod-friendly fun. oh yeah theres a storyline somewhere too, i think. dont worry about that though",2
"yes i recommend this game, what as stupid question, stop asking stupid questions.",1
"vey fun to play on pc and console. mods help cure boredom quickly if youve finished the game. pretty late for anyone to care about a review for this game but i dont care. great game 9/10",2
"great game , great history , live another life , be another hero , be a villain , you choose !!! the most important part of this game for me was the history , that u can modify every moment. divine parts of the game that make me love it , and one of them was the end of main history that makes u feel complete with yourself . some npcs are dumb , but others are really smart that makes the game equilibrated . every choose can have different reactions . this is art in pixels , this is skyrim .",1
"words can not even discribe this game. this has to be the my favorate game of all time becuse ive played 388.4 hours. and ive compled the game 3 times as mage warrior and theif. ive been playing sinse 2012 so that is alomst 3 years and i realised that you can never be done with an elder scrolls game.ive been olny playing straght no extra game that just goes to show unbeliveble the map and there is a welth of dongens to clear and things to game and i havent even played with it dlcs i bought this game for 50ish bucks and it was totaly it i have played oblivion and morroiwind they were amizing so im recomening skyrim but im realy recomending the elder scrolls. {expt for elder scrollls online that sucked] the olnt poroblem is that i belive that if theres about 50 markarth witch is not that much for the bigest city in the nation witch is sad becuse they have like the world worse populaion. i think they should have had more peole in conculison igive this game a 100/ 100",2
"one of the best games of all time! however there is a bunch of bugs, player is a bit heavy and also, dragonborn is supposed to be the ultimate badass, not someone who goes to harvest some flowers. still, i believe that this a very good game and i cant wait to play the next franchise. overall: one of the best. rating: 10/10",1
"i played this game way to much, it is addicting and very very open worlded, the only things you cant do are kill children, kill people needed for questlines, and do better than your skill level. the add-ons improve this game tremodously and i can honestly say i would recommend this game to anyone over 12.",2
"really great game, i like the variety of different types of character you can be....i can be quite challenging, but an overall great game.",1
"excellent rpg, absolutely massive and immersive! final fantasy series used to be my all time favourite rpg series, but this beats it hands down!",1
"its really long, but still a lot of fun! first-person rpg at its finest!",2
"the standard. this is how open world fantasy is done. stand up and take notice.",1
"full of tons of fun, adventure, and complete kick- mods in the steam workshop!!!",1
"i felt a painful sensation deep in my , like a bee had just made my  his new home.",1
"this game is fun! so much replay ablity! never gets old!",1
"oh skyrim, where to begin? it took me 80+ hours to beat the main major story missions of this game. this is nearly the perfect game. so many options on how the user will want their main character to live. my character ended up being a cannibal and a werewolf obsessed with being the most powerful warrior in all of skyrim, he would do whatever is necessary to be unconquerable, even if it involves taking a life of an innocent. 9.25/10, reason being: there are many bugs and glitches that the player will encounter and may have to use the console commands to finish quests.",1
"great game with great development from the core graphics to the dynamic-ness of a chicken this game shows true passion from the developers....fyi bethesda are the best at rpgs so yah. overall amazing game with great replay ability; however there are numerous bugs but they dont take away the immersion and over time it gets quite funny! 4.8 / 5 bananas",1
"epic game! provided me with one of my most memorable gaming sessions ever over a christmas break. very good graphics and interesting story. a solid progression in the elder scrolls line. however, i would not recommend the dlc... gets boring and repetitive.",1
"ther classes are interesting and so is the quests in the game it shines very bright even though some places might look a bit dull.",1
"this game never ends its a perfect game for everyone and you can do what ever you want, you can be a thief,mage,assassin or even a strong fighter maybe you want to trade alot or you just feel like riding on a dragon (dragondbord dlc needed for riding on dragons) i can recommend to fix all dlcs that makes the quest line even bigger and it may take a very long time to do all quests because there is some random quest in the cities and around the world i really recommend this game.",3
"the graphics are great, its fun to play and their are plenty of levels to keep you working.",2
"one of my favorite games by far! recommended to everyone who loves rpg game and/or big open world games :d",1
"its not as good as oblivion, but it is still fun to quest aimlessly around the world and find random stuff.",2
"this game is: 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain and 100% reason to purchase the game.",1
"ive been chasing the dragon for a while now. will update this review later. 6/17 hats. update: i have caught the dragon. i somehow swallowed it. now i can win any argument simply by yelling so loud, they will turn into dust.",1
"still starting out really but this game is deep and full of things to do ....if you can keep from getting lost and eaten by bears, you get to kill some freaking dragons.",1
"i wasted my money... none of the issues with the last elder scrolls game have really been improved. within 30 minutes of playing this game after the introduction, i didnt want to play any more. with games out there like kingdoms of amalur and assassins creed, how can you have a game thats so clunky and where the combat is so terrible? thats the number one thing in my book. i have no idea how the metascore or any score for this game is so high. i thoroughly enjoyed kingdoms of amalur...played it twice through. its a way better game. it only took 30 minutes to not want to play this game any more. well see if i feel up to trying again later, but id rather go enjoy something else for now.",1
"after spending 300 hours playing oblivion, i couldnt wait to get hold of the sequel skyrim. its proved to be as good if not better. the ui could be improved but you get used it quite quickly. also the graphics are truly stunning. roll on elder scrolls 6!",1
"skyrim is an amazing game, i have not completed it yet because the game is so huge (thats what she said.) the game includes a awesome story that i am excited to complete. also the hidden side quests around the game are great. such as red eagle. a second story about a sword and power which makes the game even better, longer and more worth the money you are paying. the game is also great with mods (if you want them) i would recomend some graphics enhancers but its still good in general. out of 10 i would give the game a 9. no game is great enough to be a 10 but this comes pretty close.",1
"addictive, engaging, a depth that will rarely be rivaled. skyrim delivers a journey unlike most found in modern rpgs, an ability to go where you want, when you want, and more importantly *how* you want. with modding at the forefront of the game, it retains a freshness that stays long after others have fallen by the wayside. spend time with skyrim, and youll find out what everyone else has so far: theres not enough time for both skyrim and other responsibilities. but those other responsibilities can wait a few more minutes.",1
"you yell at dragons to kill them. how much more of a badass character do you want to play?",1
"this is the best game ive ever played, and if you are on the verge of getting it dont hesistate get it now! (small warning it will kill your social life without hesitation)",1
"incredible. no other way to put it. modding is amazing and vanilla is quite good. basicly just incredible.",1
"love this game! had it on xbox 360 for the longest time and now i join the no disc pc master race!",1
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"definetely check this game out, great dialogue and storyline. really immersive, exactly what this kind of game should be aiming for! love it! d:",1
"lots of creative missions, secret missions and tons and tons of detail in the very, very large world. 10/10",1
"this game on vanilla is like raw meat. simple, hard to enjoy and ugly. but when you install mods everything changes. there can be more adventures, weaponry or annoying npcs, like racists nords, pesky elves and underrated khajiits and argonians. at least deviantart hasnt touch this game. still, i loved the game for the first time i played it.",1
"i dont normally like the fantasy genre, or fantasy games, which is why i never really felt any urge to have it. but after buying it at a killer discount, i have to admit, that im totally hooked. regarding the expansions i dont find the expansions dragonborn, or dawnguard very interesting - in fact i found them quite boring. but i did like heartfire very much.",1
"i stepped on an empty bucket and it spazzed out, hit my dude in the face and killed me 9/10 game of the year",2
"masterpeace ive got like 1200 hours (before i bought the game) and now on steam version 30 and counting i dont belive ive done even 50% of the game (im serious) playing it all the ways on all the classes all races all combantions will take like 20000hours",1
"dont sit there and listen to this recommendation, play it already!",1
"realy awesome game :d and at the steam workshop there is a mod installer",1
"i highly recommend this game. although the game comes with its fair share of glitches, there is usually always a way to fix these minor annoyances. the gameplay is solid. you will love making different types of guys and playing the game over and over again. just when you think you are done with the game, you can download a mod. get a couple of different mods together, and you have a whole new experience while playing this game. the modder community for this game has done some remarkable things. it is amazing the type of dedication people have. a special thanks to the modders and to bethesda!",1
"this game is amazing. if you have a computer, you must get it.",1
"look at the hours ive played. do they say this game sucks? no? well, you go and connect the dots.",3
"amazing! this game lets you play anyway you want to, whether you want to run around and kill everything, or try to find diplomatic non0violant ways to solve problems. you can easily choose to fight everything head on, or hire others to do the dirty work, or fight things from a distance or attack from the shadows. this game has darn near everything you would hope to find in an rpg.",1
"its a really-really good game on its own. but not until its modded does it become a great game...",1
"so much fun and so much to do! love this game and all the openness about it. you can do anything and go anywhere you want. i have had so much fun playing it.",1
"stole some cheese from a farmer and everyone tries to kill me 10/10",1
"one of the best rpgs ive ever played... besides south park: the stick of truth of coarse everyone should have this game unless you cant run it :) talking to the mac people",1
"best. game. ever. i had already completed this game a few times on the console, but the pc i just far superior. i would recommend this game to anybody that likes fantasy/rpg style games. well, what are you waiting for.... buy it today! you will not be disappointed.",1
"the best game ever and has some of the best mods!!!",1
"dont buy this game unless you have no need to go outside! its a drug stay away!",4
"its a must play, great game, great combat, and the mod community makes a great game even better.",1
"hours of endless fun and mods to always find something new to do.",1
"stab dragons. force people to carry your . yell at people. punch cat people in the face. eat everyones food. 5/5",1
"i freaking adore this game. so many possibilities with mods. definitely worth the price.",1
"who here can say skyrim sucks, its steam theres dragons theres giants mods and... cheese!!!!",1
"i could just say that and leave it but i wont. ok, i know that character creation can be a little tedious but, other than that, i can not complain about this game at all. the graphics are amazing, the dialogue and quests are intreguing, and the whole premice of being a dragonborn is just awsome. the scenary around the massive open world is breathtaking, and the inhabitants are even more so. i would honestly reccomend this game to anyone as i love it all so much! that is pretty much all i can say on this subject... let me guess, somebody stole your sweetroll...",1
"a must for rpg junkies like myself, also download creation kit in the tools.",3
"immersive gameplay and amazing graphics, especially outside at night. recommend.",1
"thers a mod where my nipples squeeze out cheese 100 outta 100 best game ever(not really but if there is holla at me)",1
"skyrim is a very nice game for gamers that want a rpg and open world type game. but you have to be creative too. 9 out of 10.",1
"face it people, there is never going to be another morrowind. in the mean time, we have dragons. thats good enough for me.",1
"you dont have this yet? why the hell not? that said, i havent found it very replayable.",1
"this game offers so much gameplay for sucha small price. get it on sale when its like 2.50 and youll be thinking to yourself this game is worth like $100. 10/10",1
"this is one of may favorite games to play, the mods are fantastic and am looking forward to future mods",1
"easily the best game in the series thus far. recommended for anyone who liked elder scrolls or arpgs in general.",2
"the game is great. but the steam account is poor on account of the lag it has. i have a couble of games with them and they all have the same problem. i wish they would go back to the old system and do away with the steam account.",1
"this game is great for those who love fantasy/rpg games as it creates a great level of immersion, gameplay, and provides an amazing storyline. skyrim has almost endless possibilities and with 3 dlcs this game easily breaks 200 hours and whenever you feel like youre bored you can fight a dragon, to exploring an ancient dungeon with challenging boss fights. if you feel like to add on to the fun give the workshop a try and you can have all you need with armor and weapon mods. however the game does have a few bugs where your followers dont come to any indoor areas but can be fixed with just using the wait mechanic and wait an hour. but the only headache one is that in the civil war questline the quest wont start but sadly the only way to fix it is to start a new game :( . 9/10 have fun with the game of a lifetime",1
"why buy this when you could buy far cry 3 and have guns",1
"you can be cat and you can also steal clothes 10/10 would bang",2
"get this game. why are you questioning it? it is amazing!",1
"excellent game, great choice of characters, great graphics & freedom of play. wish there were more hours in the day to play it more often!",1
"the best role-play game ever! great voice acting,awesome story line. like myths and dragons? then play it! ;)",1
"lovely game, however i dont have the time to dig myself into the game. too time consuming.",1
"great game you can just play this games for days and not ger bored.",1
"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",1
"i totally recommend this game to any fans of the elder scrolls series or anyone whos new to the series. my favorite part about skyrim is the exploration aspect--although its world is not as bright as those of morrowind or cyrodiil, it has its many charms that make it such a great game. i recommend that you buy the game with all dlcs and get the official high res texture pack. and one more thing: get mods. even though the vanilla game has lots of content that will keep you occupied for many, many hours, you may get bored at some point. i highly recommend mods that add dlc-sized content like falskaar and wyrmstooth and those that improve the look of skyrim, especially enb, smim, ruins clutter improved, etc.",1
"i totally and definately recomend this game as of right now im only maybe 10 or so hours in and it is already amazing ive killed dragons, almost got killed by guards, and ive went undercover and infiltrated a suspicious place that has to do with an evil organization of sorts and im sure there is still much more to come on my skyrim adventure.",1
"great game, might be a bit old but with mods its still looks amazing. ive played this on ps3, xbox and pc and its so much better on pc by far.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skrim still never ceases to amaze me i higly recomend this game to anyone who is looking for an adventure or who wants to hunt and murrder all those before them. i would give this game a 97 out of 100 due to the graphics not being the best for a game made in 2011 but however what this game lacks in graphics makes up for in gamplay. this game is the kind of game that will draw you in for hours and every part of the massive map is detailed and will make you want to explore it and find the secrets and treasures that come with the doungens and villages that you will explore. so far i have put hundreds of hour into this game on the xbox-360 and now that i have played it on the pc it still amazes me the stunning detail tamerial has to offer its players.",1
"skyrim is awesome because its awesome so get it or you wont be able to play skyrim so get it",4
"this game is awesome. it offers one of the greatest singleplayer gaming experience i have ever had. the story is good and the game offers a lot of sidequests so the time you will spend to get this game 100% is massive. the dlcs are good and will give you a decent amount of extra gameplay. 11/10",1
"an amazing and gorgeous game, especially when you throw in a few top rated mods. absolutely recommended if you enjoy open ended rpgs.",1
"having played this game for more then 700 hours (not counting time used with a launcher seperate from steam), i recommend it to anyone that likes open world games, the modding community for this game is what really kept me going, i consider it as the best game i have ever played in this genre. mods are still being made all the time, really worth taking a look. dlcs are worth every penny, more or less for hearthfire... otherwise, youre in for hundreds of hours of fun and modding... if you really want it to be fantastic.",3
"skyrim really is a great game. vanilla skyrim has so much to do. you dont even have to mod skyrim to have a great time. skyrims concept is really great. every so often a human is bless with the power to speak like a dovah is super cool. skyrim has so much mod potential as well. so many places and people who could be given more in depth back stories by mods. really just a great over all game.",1
"pro: this is the best of the elder scrolls series to date. story line and game play provides for total character emersion. steam community includes great expandability for those that are seeking to fine tune the game experience. con: there are only two cons that i have after 3500 saves and 600 hours of game play. the first is one that is consistent with previous series. game saves are linier. playing multiple characters requires scrolling through literally thousands of game saves to find the specific save point. character category would be helpful. the second con relates to item categories and similar to the save issue. though improved from later titles, there is room for improvement. if betheseda simply added one more category, stolen i would be happy. neither issue affects game play.",3
"well, another review. this time its skyrim if you didnt notice. first off all. i loved this game when i had it on console. it was a good game to waste some time. i have put a lot of hours into this game and i still havent found every single thing in the game. there are also quite a few quests i havent done. went i got it on pc a couple of days ago. i discovered the wonderous world of mods. there are so many mods out there for this game. if you can think of a mod, somebody has probably already made it. anyway, there is too much stuff in this game for me to review in depth. (i like to keep my reviews short(ish)) if this game is on sale, you should pick it up.",1
"if you like going where you want when you want and free of wielding any medieval weapons without class restrictions, this game is for you. ive played elder scrolls since daggerfall and the team did a great job with the combat and dialogue aspects. the levelling in skyrim is simple and very logical. you have to play twice this game at least, but i wont say why :)",2
"sex position simulator with dragon toys and magic. 8/10",1
"9/10 i love the elder scrolls series, this is what a aaa game should be!",1
"pretty fun, but you might not like it if you played morrorwing and oblivion. they dumbed down everything. but mods fix all of it.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a truly excellent game and with the right mods it can quickly become one of the most immersive. the modding community for skyrim is now so vast that the ways to enjoy your game are endless. however if you dont want mods then i would still recomend the vanilla game to people who enjoy fantasy and rpg games. skyrims open world map is great as if you dont want to do any quests you can just pick any direction and begin exploring and adventuring as you see fit. there are also many different play styles, with 10 races to choose from and even more skill trees to explore (18 to be precise) you can pretty much do anything! overall i highly recommend this game, and all of the dlc! 100% recomend it, 10/10 game.",2
"the trailer is so much better than the game i am reccomending this game, but i reccomend tes3-4 more. even though this game is great, it is not perfect. get oblivion, this is hype residue get oblivion, the questline is better get oblivion. its better, trust me",1
"still have yet to get to 100 hours. have over 100 hours on console but on pc around 40. life sucks skyrim is life i think.",1
"good game that has potential with modz to be over 10000 hrs",1
"without mods this game is engaging, great, expansive, beautiful, and everything else one would desire from an elder scrolls series, if not toned down to appeal to a wider demographic in light of the rising popularity of both gaming and the elder scrolls series. with mods, this game becomes much like the holodeck from star trek; a blank slate for which any fantasy can be revealed. much like rule 34, if something exists, there is a skyrim mod for it.",1
"i installed a mod that made dragons shout oooh yeaaaaahhhh 8/8 -ign m8",1
"interesting game. i cant say much for the depth of character building (as oblivion had a lot more options) but i can say that many perks feel more relevant. leveling is simplier now. a bit disappointed with the voice acting, but with a game this huge its not surprising to see a corner cut somewhere. overall a very worth-while game. expect to get your moneys worth here- a lot to do and it seems the quests never end!",1
"the sky really is the limit with this game. if you dont already own this game then you are a sap!",2
"what can i say nothing really ..... this game was gifted to me by a good chum the end",1
"a beautiful and immersive game, this is definetly what they were going for when they started developing! :d",1
"good rpg game. story was very boreing though and the only thing that made it a bit fun was the mods.",1
"ive always heard great things about skyrim so it went on sale and bought it. takes me back to the way eq used to feel, butsingle player. so this is pretty much single player eq. much fun. so fantasy. many dragon.",1
"it is an amazing role playing game (rpg), with an interesting storyline - linking with other elder scrolls games containing refernces and a beautiful enviroment with snowy hills and mountains and dense forests with exotic plants and creatures lurking around such as trolls and wolves all over the place. this is truly an adventurous and brilliant game.",1
"no doubt the best game i have ever played. there is no need to say anything else.",1
"ive only had more play time than this on one game wow craft but i actually like this one better than wow i just get bored a little quicker before i come back to it in a few months or so",1
"of all the games that i have ever played, this is by far the best. even two years after release, the graphics still hold their own, and the gameplay is fantastic. the way that the game lets you do what you want, when you want is just awesome. it is probably pretty hard to make a game of this size and scope and for it to acually be a sucess. the team at bethesda is by far my favorite gaming studio, and they deserve all the praise that they get for this game. the dlc is really well done to, and if you were thinking about thorwing some money down for it, you wont be dissapointed. but if you were sceptical for the game, dont be. the game is worth every single penny, and is just fantastic. a perfect score in my opinon. just fantasic.",1
"great game, so much to do, could spend 500 hours as i did in oblivion.",1
"there are games you can finish in a couple of hours, others in 20h, others in 30h...not skyrim. you dont just finish playing skyrim, skyrim finishes you! :-)",1
"skyrim is one of the finest games i have played in my lifetime. it beats almost every other rpg i have ever played in graphics and gameplay. the story is a bit lacking with some confusing plot points, but it is still fun to complete. the modding community is what really makes this game, though. the graphics were, at the time of release, worshipped by the internet for how amazing they were. now, they rival games like crysis while still being fairly stable with the addition of just a few mods. 9/10. if you dont own this game, you are missing out on a cornerstone of video game history.",1
"vast and infinite quests, you could spend almost forever in skyrim. bethesda has made a good game, despite the buggy launch. if you loved tes oblivion, fallout 3 & new vegas. you have a 99% chance that you will love this game too. that said its not perfect, none of bethesdas game are, the combat can get a bit repetitive. and once you gain a bunch of levels the game will become pretty easy. of course you can bump the difficulty, but to me it seems the game just gets really horrible, sure its challenging but not in the right way. a huge plus with the pc version is the mod community which has since the launc day made amazing things to suppliment the game.",1
"i buy this game on sale and sink 13 minutes into it. good investment",1
"wasted 600 hours and 200gb of hdd space for mods on this. would reccommend",1
"after playing for 48 hours straight, going through 20 cups of coffee, and not eating in 2 days... i finally remembered to start the main quest. 12/10",1
"love the open world feeling that bethesda kind of pioneered. love that you can join any faction in the game: thieves, dark brotherhood, etc.",1
"incredible game, incredible story, incredible everything!",1
"i have a really bad habit of downloading rpgs and after like an hour of gameplay, i uninstall it because it is very boring. skyrim, however, made me keep going.",1
"excellent overall gameplay with countless hours of exploration and discovery. large modding community with regular dlc and patches. well worth the money especially if one can pick this up on sale.",4
"skyrim is an open world rpg that features a briliant main story and several side quests to keep you playing for hours. there are several factions to join, and even a war to pick a side in. its hard to describe my love for this game! 11/10 would recomend for anyone!",1
"skyrim is a really good game. the story is good, the combat is good, and everything else is good. the only thing that would make it better is if you could have a friend join.",1
"i do recommend this but im not sure if theres a point in writing this because everyone knows about skyrim and its glory.",2
"a brilliant game that i have owned on x-box for years",1
"skyrim is a great rpg game, with active battles, hundreds of different pieces of gear, hours of gameplay in the main story, and dont even mention all the sidequests. thres 10+ skills to level, in the 3 basic classes: the mage, the warrior, and the theif. the mage includes perks such as reducing the mana for spells, the warrior using less stamina for things such as power attacks, and the theif being able to backstab people for 15x the base damage. theres even in-game trainers if youre too lazy to level up a skill by using it.",1
"just epic game, gameplay, music, crafting, building, storymultithreading, dialogues, mods! there is no duch thing that you cant do in this game. 1010",2
"i truly think that skyrim is one of the best rpgs to ever be released. it is one of the most beautiful, open-world rpgs out to date. if you love any type of rpg, you will love skyrim. there is so much to do, it is exactly never-ending. buy it",1
"1. finish game 2. get mods 3. finish game again with mods 4. get more mods 5. finish game again with more mods 6. rinse and repeat for infinite joy",2
"one of the best games ive ever played. beautiful open world to explore and incredible replayability.",2
"i love this game. simple as that. i love the midevil feel of it and the hole dragon idea is amazing. the fighting is a bit clunky but managable. the entire map is amazing and looks even better. the entire game looks beautiful. the spellcasting system is fun and the razees and super fun to mess with. i can wait for elder scolls iv and hope that it even better than this. overall i would reccomend this to anyone who likes midevil warfare, dragons, fighting, adventure, and a lot of fun.",1
"this is the worst game to ever be made, theres no guns and i had to read this is bulshiot i never want to play this gaylord fager game again fauk u bethseda even the experts agree 1/10 worst sword fites ever - game informer 2/50 wouldnt let my autistic dog play this - ur momma only homos play this peace of sheit fauk u 1/10 all over",1
"10/10 best game ive played. loved the everything about it. modding community is creative",1
"ok, now hold on all of you xbox skyrim first timers that are looking at this review......its not a bad game! i had this game on xbox as soon as it came out and i was thoroughly dissapointed with the quality of this new masterpiece. it was just destroying me slowly so i had to get rid of it. so i bought my pc and thought that i might give it one last chance to see if this game is worth its reviews and high price. oh my f*cking god! this game is amazing! the console commands, endless amount of workshop items, unbelievable graphics and just everything about this beautiful game make it an amazing experience for anyone that knows what true quality is. sure the first missions can be boring in all, but please give it a chance you will not regret it! it has me stuck to this chair full of buttjuices just staring at it admiring the beauty. it even turned me lesbian! (jokes im a guy^^) but jesus, this game is marvellous! 100000000/10",1
"my favorite game is skyrim just buy it you will not regret",1
"its suprised me that wild open world. but attack motion is very suck how it like hit air.",1
"a guy wouldnt sell me his horse...so i fus ro dahd him off a cliff, then took his horse.",1
"i went to jail for accidentally stealing a bucket. best realism ever",1
"i dont think ive put more hours into a game. that should tell you all you need to know. the combat is better than a lot of rpgs, the story is alright, the crafting hooked me, and the world as a whole sucked me in. i cannot recommend this game enough to anyone who loves video games.",1
"its a very fun game and its very interesting , and if you are too bored playing it you can add mods that improve the game. best game i have played so far",1
"all girls are naked anime/hentai character simulator is working good! nice game",1
"interface is annoying as hell, game crashes on alt+tab without mods, and theres significantly less customisation than in previous tes games. the game likes to crash randomly, the textures are worse than in oblivion, and the voice acting seems pretty shonky, since everyone speaks in some kind of russian accent.",1
"this game has exceeded my expectations and is the most fun game (besides dishonored). pros: this game is a freeroam (means you can roam freely), this is awesome because instead of having to go down a certain way you can choose many ways of getting to the same place. another pro is that you can choose the path that you want to go down (mage, warrior, thief). it also includes many oppritunities like to be an assassin to a farmer. cons: its easy to get lost, there is almost too many oppritunities, that it gets you swept away. the people constantly say the same thing like the guards will say  i used to be an adventurer like you, until i took an arrow to the knee. this is kind of a running joke with this game. over all is say this game is one of the best games i have ever played. id say two thumbs up and 5 stars. this game used to be 50$ when i bought it and it was worth the money. now i see its 20$ and i think its a very good deal on what i think the games worth. i hope this discription was useful on deciding on getting the game. good luck.",2
"awesome game with fantastic graphics and a huge world to explore. love it<3",1
"so many possibilities and such scope its hard not to recommend this game. made even more fun with some of the thousands of mods available, get ready to lose a few days of your life!",1
"buy this game if youve never played it. it offers so many hundreds of hours of fun and involoving gameplay. very few games can match the shere value that skyrim offers.",1
"not a fan of the melee combat in this game, so when i started playing i didnt have a good experience. then i shot my first arrow into the face of a bandit. 123 hours later, with the main story complete, i still enjoy shooting things in the face with an arrow.",1
"absolutely amazing.. stunning visuals. great modding community. hundreds of hours worth of content. great and deep story. great voice acting and npcs. need i continue?",1
"this game is excellent. in my eyes this game is a masterpiece. if you are the last five people who does not own this game i must say this: you must buy it, because it is worth every cent.",2
"well, ill need to start with the bad things... skyrim has one of the worst combat mechanics ive seen, a pretty nice amount of bugs, many boring repetitive quests and not-so-spectacular main story... but... what it has can outshine those things... it has stunning visuals, a vast and beautifully thought-out world, nice characters and soo much content (and thats actually excluding all the mods) for your moneys worth... well, im usually not the person who will recommend the game with all those bad things, especially over because of nice visuals, but this game just wants you to play it... it will usually suck you in, and wont let you go, and i guess thats the most important thing...",1
"this game is always exiting, beautiful, challenging and all around amazing. i beleive that skyrim has set a new standard for all rpgs, even though it is over two years old now. and with the massive community of modders, it will only continue to thrive. skyrim is without a doubt one of the best games ive ever played. 2/10 would not bang.",1
"this game is obviously amazing. if you dont buy it, you need to slap yourself.",1
"even without mods, this game is amazing. pc users have the edge in the thriving community that put out more and more content that elevates skyrim to the next level. 10/10",1
"this game seemed boring at first but its actually pretty fun after awhile if you like the time era. i give it a 4.5/5",1
"great game. i enjoyed much of it. most of its storyline is great, the soundtrack is at its best. definetly a great adventure and role playing game!",1
"over a hundred hours of treasure hunting, cave exploring, bandit killing, and oh yeah...dragon slaying! its like bethesda went back to the fallout series and made it 10x better. i highly recommend this game...no, this masterpiece!",1
"amazing, beautiful, and crisp....skyrim is definitely a game to own. i cant even tell you how many hours i have played and not get bored of the epic chapter of the elder scrolls. also the immagination and thought that people put in the modds to make it more enjoyable is simply legendary. if you want a game that you will be drolling over, this is the game to get!",2
"i am finding it hard to put into words just how impressive the elder scrolls v: skyrim is. i will try to be succinct. the game world and rendering engine is absolutely beautiful. the most common screenshot i take is simply of the awe-inspiring vistas found throughout the world. the world is also incredibly atmospheric - while wandering the frozen wastes around winterhold, ive never felt so alone in a computer game. combat and magick are similar to what weve seen in past tes games, but skyrim comes with a few new pros. there are a few cut-scene-style execution kills; instead of a straight 1-100 scale, you can now take perks which improve your abilities in various ways. this is a good addition, but some of the perks need to be re-scaled. skyrim has expanded what it means to be a role-playing game in the modern era. the world is livelier than ever, and you can do things like sit in an inn and listen to a bard sing; get married (not just a 10-second erotic cutscene!);",3
"one of the best games i have ever played in my life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"one of my favorite games of all time, if youre looking for a great open world adventure with a vast amount of character customization and a huge modding community to keep you playing for hours on end.",1
"i used to play fallout, then i took an arrow to the knee.",1
"this game is so awesome, it makes me want to cry with awesomeness, after putting in over 500 hours on the console version of skyrim and now time to put in even more hours on the pc version, i just... i cant even describe the epicness of this game, stop reading and buy it already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"a brilliant open world rpg where youre never without stuff to do. you cant go very far without finding a new quest or new enemies to test yourself against. admittedly there are a few bugs but theyre mostly silly or funny ones. the modding community is amazing also! if you like rpgs and adventure/exploration then this game is defintiely worth your time! plus, there are dragons! need i say more? xd",1
"the undisputable king of open world fantasy role playing games.",1
"this is an amazing game with easy modding capabilities. so easy to get lost in this game for weeks.",1
"why dont you have it yet?! have you been living under a rock?! if you have then pay attention because you will want to get this game. this game is amazing -- if you couldnt tell already -- for a couple reasons. the environment is amazing, it makes you feel like you are actually there in the forests and mountains. the amount of detail that went into making the environments is commendable because it really gives the game a sense of being which is something other bethesada games did lack a bit. combat has been enhanced and now being a mage is a viable choice to make. spells are diverse not just in damage and effects but visually as well. you can throw ice spear, frost storms, fireballs, lightning bolts, create cloaks of energy and thats just the destruction spells. stealth is much more tuned as well with a whole skill tree to accompany it. make pickpocketing easier or make yourself practically invisible. inventory has been upgraded to be easier to manage. verdict: get it!",1
"this is one of the best rpgs ive played in a couple of years. a massive world to explore, lots of quests to do, places to discover, loot, crafting... its all there. give it a go.",1
"a modders paradise and hell all in one package. and trust me, youre gonna want to be modding this game as soon as possible.",1
"i may have started more new games than i have hours played. buy if only to see opening sequence.",1
"i stabbed someone in the face then i ducked down and he never noticed me... 10/10",1
"without mods: meh, this is cool and all but not really all that interesting. i think ill play something else now. with mods: jesus christ i could play this game for years and not even care",4
"-- warning -- once played, you will never see the sun again! oh and... hey.... wanna buy some skooma?",1
"this game ruined me. i played way too much of it when i should have been doing other things, like studying for exams. you should buy it.",3
"voice acting and a lot of bugs. average bethesda game/10",1
"9/10 this is a great game and one of my favourite i have ever played. but im reviewing it on its basics. no mods. it gets a bit boring without mods but you can always add them.",1
"this game has been out for over 2 years and i am still playing it. its beautiful, huge, and fun to explore. this is truly an rpg, because there are many different ways to play the game. the downsides to the game is that many quests require you to delve into a cave, which gets repetitive. the voice acting is also kind of bad, and the npcs are forgettable. the greatest thing about this game is the modding community. there are many mods and enbs that enhance skyrim visually making it one of the most impressive games out there in terms of graphics. there are also mods that overhaul the gameplay of skyrim like t3end0s skyrim redone (skyre), and then there are joke mods. i saw one that turns alduin (the main enemy in the game) into a fire breathing thomas the tank engine. scary stuff.",2

"i was walking around when a greybeard decided to shout me and threw me off a cliff. 10/10 would get shout again.",1
"10/10 - immersive, massive, and already cannonical",2
"this is my most favorite game of all time. i owned it on console, having roughly 300 hours, before i got it here on steam. you can never go wrong with getting this game. it is truly a masterpiece. there is an unlimited amount of playing time on here between the game itself, (which would take years to finish fully) dlc and mods, which add an amazing amount of extra time and fun to this already incredible game. if youre on the fence about getting this game, trust me you wont be disappointed. you can shout to burn things on fire! there is a huge variety of armor to choose from and a crazy amount of weapons. if you like magic, theres always hilarious moments using your extremely long of spells. if i had to live with one game for the rest of my life it would be this, hands down! 1000000000000000000000000000000000/10 get this game!!",1
"nick needs to stop playing this game 4/-23 would not break.",1
"skyrim is easily one of the best games of this generation. its one of the games that you get as much out of as you put in. its also one of the games you play exactly how you want to play. you can choose to ignore the main story immediately after beginning or play through the quests like a linear action adventure game. speaking of quests, theres an awful lot of them. the main story is centred on the return of dragons to the world. pretty soon, you find out you are the legendary dragonborn, a man or woman with the ability to consume dragon souls. its your job to find out why the reptiles have returned and try and protect the world from this new menace. two thumbs from me! because the game deserves it.",1
"very fun and addictive, and including all of the workshop items people keep uploading its an experience that will keep on going. for me this was a fun adventure through the land of skyrim, able to do whatever whenever and for that action to affect many other thing on your journey. the game lagged a bit and crashed a few times but that was probably due to my crappy computer. defenetily a great game to pick up even in years to come.",1
"great game overall. the dlc on sale just make it ever better. yes it is not a hardcore rpg like avernum, ultima, or fallout 2. but is is really fun :)",2
"one of my favorite games, played through it a few times on pc a couple times on xbox. love this game. perfect addition to the elder scrolls series.",1
"it is ordinarily interesting. even if it gets bored, you can enjoy yourself further by mod introduction.",1
"85 hours in, and im only halfway through the main story. the ammount of content in this game is incredible. best quest system ive ever encountered. fun to play.",1
"i think that skyrim is a a game with a lot of potential, but sadly all of that potential is in the hands of the modders as the developers seemed to lack any desire to properly port this game to the pc. the game itself is bland on almost all levels. melee combat turns to smashing the mouse button as fast as you can, the story is drawn out for how little content it really has, and the overall game feels like a poor port. shadow bugs, lod bugs, quest scripts breaking, and numerous objects/textures which look really bad without the help of mods. mods can fix a good amount of the games issues, but many of them will be impossible to fix without complete engine overhauls. on top of all of this, much of the landscape, architecture, and caves are recycled, which just adds to the blandness of the game. i would recommend this game only to people with the intent of intense modding.",2
"bir daar kred! (the dragon shout for buy this game, im not kidding look it up.)",1

"macho man randy savage dragons. what else do you need?",1
"i cannot tell you how much time i have spent on this game since launch when i got it for my xbox. it is an incredible adventure with so much to do. an expansive world with a ton of quests. beast slaying, murder, thievery, magic and of course, the good ol path of the warrior, this game has it all.",1
"this game is the best game ever, and when ever i play a game i ask myself how is this game relateable to skyrim.",1
"helped me lose an annoying girlfriend. seems they dont appreciate it when you lock yourself in your apartment for 2 weeks with no outside contact. but hey, i beat alduin and started a second playthrough! totally worth it.",1
"vikings. mountains. snow. backwards flying dragons. looks pretty. and a lot of people apparently voiced by arnold schwarzenegger. i felt i had seen it all after 30 hours, but what makes the pc version superior is mods. i always wanted to ride a chicken. tenouttaten",1
"skyrim is one of the best video games ever made. mods = infinite replayability.",1
"of course i do. i just built a sick pc so playing it on ultra high makes it really amazing!",1
"excellent rpg. open: you can travel and do quests in many regions. play it again and go to completely different regions. at the same time you dont get lost. the journal keeps track of all quests and when you select one quest it will show you in the map where you need to go. deep storyline. perhaps the best rpg ever (including other excellent rpgs such as mass effect series, dragon age origins, previous elder scrolls).",1
"incredible amount of content, easily immersive. lets me be a lesbian without thinking twice, love it.",1
"oh, there once was a hero named ragnar the red who came riding to whiterun from ole rorikstead and the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade as he told of bold battles and gold he had made but then he went quiet, did ragnar the red when he met the shield-maiden matilda, who said; oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead now i think its high time that you lie down and bleed! and so then came clashing and slashing of steel as the brave lass matilda charged in, full of zeal and the braggart named ragnar was boastful no more- when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!",2
"fantasitic game everyone knows this im just posting so i can get community badge",1
"this generations the best rpg & mfps must be played by everyone who is living on this earth.",1
"loved it, infinite replay, and mods as far as the eye can see to customize at will",1
"dont be a console peasant. play skyrim on pc with  tons of mods to make the game look gorgeous. if you havent played this, something is seriously wrong with you. 11/10",2
"this game is absolutely amazing. i used to own it on xbox and had many hours of play on it. then i bought it on steam, and i can still play for hours. it makes it hard to find other games to play.",1
"excellent game, keeps me occupied for hours. highly recommend.",1
"very good game, lots of quest and things to do, the only downside is clunky changing of weapons, spells etc.",1
"this is a game so diverse and so widespread that i started to sweat while playing it. im not quite certain why this is rated m since their is no nudity, they dont really swear and theres barely any blood. the graphics are outstanding, story line is kick- and ah... what am i wasting my time here for? i should be playing this game right now!",1
"day 41 they still havent noticed the dead cultist i threw into the blacksmith forge in whiterun.",2
"great story, great visuals, great game! not to mention the modding community adds months more time to play around in the lands of skyrim.",1
"this game is too much fun. very time consuming, so beware.",1
"i dont know how i should rate this game honestly... i love it and the story it great but... it has some really bad bugs... whenever i finish playing and play something else i have to wait for 5 minutes because the steam net work says we are uptadating skyrim, pleas wait... and there are no new updates! also it got more anoyingi was in a giant dungeon and finally i finished it, half an hour later it crashed and now i have to do it all over again. i really like the game but bethsda pleas fix!!",2
"i have not been a big fan of the elder scrolls series but skyrim i found was a really good game the controls are quite easy to learn and arent to complex as well the graphics of this game is super but lags out a bit however that could be my laptop overall i would rate skyrim 4/5",1
"great game, but its a bit glitchy when it downloads",1
"immersive, major replayability, amazing lore and a bazillion of mods to enhance the game experience. go fus ro dah your credit card.",3
"i bought a bow in real life after spending 80+ hours stalking s in skyrim.",1
"awesome game - just wish the dead bodies dont roll around like they have no bones. easily addicted. some frustrating aspects involve being stuck at cutscenes and unable to see underwater, causing character to drown and die.",1
"dont get into modding it will only get more ed up as u dig deepur. i hve ovur 420 modz and it aint wurkin out.",1
"skyrim(the fitith game in the elder scrolls seiries) is a great game with lots of things to do. this game has good graphics, sound, story, plot, and more. i get to become the person who i want to be. i could be a amazing warrior who concered many dungons and dragons to a thief who stole great riches than someone could count. this rpg is very great and you need to buy it! 20/10 dont beleive me, then read my play time",4
"fantastic game if you didnt already know. the base game is good enough but with mods you can make anything happen.",1
"be like marisa and steal all the books in skyrim and stash them in your house along with everything else!!!!!",1
"bethesda never fails to make a good game. elder scrolls games come out every 5 years, and each one has enough content to last that long easily.",1
"synashi here, with a review of the elder scrolls v: skyrim. 200 years have passed since the oblivion crisis. the imperial province of skyrim is dealing with an exhausting civil war between its empire, and the stormcloak rebellion. the rumors of dragons are making things even worse. however, you bring a light of hope in the form of the dovahkiin; a hero who is foretold to rid the world of dragons! while the main story is a good diversion, there are also an overwhelming amount of sidequests to keep you playing! recommended for those who like wide open sandbox rpgs. rating: 9/10",1
"probably the best game of this current generation. its a massive world that is easy to spend hours and hours in.",1
"this game is an open world, free roam game where you can bascially, well, do whatever the heck you want to do. skyrim is set 200 years after the events of the 4th game, oblivion, and i must say, they did a great job designing it. in skyrim, you are the ancient dragonborn, a mortal with the body of a mortal, and the soul of a dragon. they slay and steal the soul of dragons. you do what you want, sneak into peoples house? why not? pickpocket ppl? yes! this game has everything that you want, but the question is, do you have what it takes to play this game for the same amount of time that i have or greater? look at me, 1,041 hours of skyrim played, thats more than all my other games, thats good. so what are you waiting for? buy this game and see what you think. find out for yourself!!!",4
"another addition to the elder scrolls, skyrim had my hopes up for a great sequel to the other games. having been fond of morrowind and oblivion, i had preordered skyrim the moment i could afford too. only to find out that skyrim is so graphic heavy that if your computer doesnt have top of the line hardware your going to run into issues. my radeon hd4800 cant handle skyrim and i crash to desktop almost religiously near any town, to the point that i am no longer playing skyrim because of the fustration. i recommend skyrim only if your computer can actually handle it. even the minimal requirements to run the game does not guarentee that it will actually work. ill return to playing skyrim once ive forked over a bit of money and time to upgrade my computer to at least decent standards.",1
"excellent game. second favorite elder scrolls next to morrowind. could use less quests with better variety, but overall very satisfying. dont speed through the main story quest, and try to create a character with an identity early. 9.5/10",1
"awesome game and even better with the mods every one should get this play it first with nothing and then mod the hell out of it and have some more fun , havnt stop play after on go it on a sale event :p",1
"this game is incredibly addictive to play. ive had this game for a short while now (about 3-4 days) and have a game time of 18hrs if you want to quit life then this is the game for you!",1
"one of the best rpgs i have ever played. if you want something that is really fun and that you can play multiple times with multiple play styles and still find a ton of new things every time... then definitely check out skyrim.",2
"by far one of the worlds best games. non-stop fun with an endless story",1
"i dont really have to say much in this review other then if you do not own this game and you love rpgs, youve been missing out. from gorgeous visuals, to the diverse gameplay, no game has come near such a milestone. this game provides all of the necessary tools needed for a game of its kind to succeed. a gripping storyline, power to the player, and a hell of a lot of stuff to do.",1
"amazing game but ever since i switched from xbox 360 to pc i need mods to enjoy the game.",1
"i love this game i could play it forever and not get bored, but i dont get why an email has to be sent to get add ons because the stupid emailnever comes.",3
"great game you should get it... make sure you have a good computer or the fame rate might get bad. favorite par is the free realming not forced to do missions :d get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! >:o xd",1
"this game is very fun! i have always liked it on consoles and have beaten it on there, but i bought it on pc for the summer sale. you can do much more on the pc, it doesnt take forever to load, it looks prettier, and you can run mods on it. this game is a great rpg and is worth the money. (i would get it before the steam sale is over for a simply 5 usd)",1
"game of the year. best game of this decade so far.",1
"amazing and immersive. i loved the other es games, this one holds true to the tradition while adding some new elemnts",1
"am a new comer to the seires have now played oblivion am in looooooooovvvvvveeeeeee.",1
"the simplified system allows for more smooth gameplay compared to oblivion and morrowind but it still has some flaws. sadly it doesnt have lot of lore behind like morrowind but its still better than oblivion.",3
"even after almost 3 years, this game is just great! there is alot to do and to explore, and the modding community has alot of other great things. there are some bugs in the game tough, but im sure there are some fixes for those bugs in the steam workshop or somewhere else on the internet so they can be fixed.",1
"a little bit of something for everyone, and theres a lot of somethings to go around. you could spend most of your time just doing side quests and exploring the rather large land that is skyrim. or you could blow right through the main storyline. whats that you say? youve spent countless hours in the wilderness and defeated any and all who crossed you? never fear, brave adventurer - the community has provided plenty of mods to keep you going. everything from new weapons and armor to new questlines, to difficulty tweaks making the game as easy or as challenging as you want. theres a little something here for everyone. now if only theyd add co-op...",1
"this game is beautiful. the environment is not only huge, but stunning as well. the combat is not the best, but the amount of customization and character development make up for this. if over 100 hours of vanilla gameplay isnt enough for you, this game has hundreds of mods for it so you can make the game whatever you want.",2
"i had this game previously on the ps3, but after playing so many hours of skyrim i decided to get it for the pc. the gameplay as well as the storyline is great!",1
"i only get this game so i can play as a gay cat that hits bears with a prison shiv and no clothes.",1
"ok its skyrim. its biiig and full of things and its cool to explore all the enormous world. i did it and i have a lot of hours of playing. but... at the end, this game has no soul. i played it the last year and i dont remember nothing. i dont like to find myself in the woods and saying: ....ummm what was i doing? where were i going? ...who is me, and who is this woman that always follow me and is not able to do a real conversation?? yeah, exploring and trying things is cool, but i prefer a game with smaller worlds and stronger narratives. 5/10",1
"this game took up over 425 hours of my life, great game, theres a bit of bugs but there mostly minor.",2
"have you ever wanted to steal horses and kill inocent people and dragons play skyrim",1
"the truely best way of recommending this game is by saying... if your not playing this... you arent living a good life. even after you beat the game and do the 3 dlcs... you still have tons to do like the thieves guild, the dark brother hood, randomly kill people has a vampire lord/werewolf, the many many mods, etc.... the end of this game is only the begining.",1
"amazing rpg. this was the first elder scrolls game i ever played, and wow i was in for it, over 100+ hours later i was still hooked. so much to do, and such a giant map. i would reccomend this as an awesome game for anyone looking to try anew rpg, but has not played it yet (if such people exist!!) def get! now!....",1
"fantastic game, as to be expected from bethesdas elder scroll series. dont take my word on it, play it for yourself. i doubt you will regret it.",1
"tes v: skyrim is my first game in the tes series and i have to admit, its pretty god damn awesome. i originally purchased this game for my ps3 and through the discovery of pc gaming and modding i rediscovered what i loved about skyrim. the open world, downloadable mods, and the community. although the steam workshop for skyrim may be limited, there are other sites, such as the skyrim.nexus which host an outstanding amount of mods and user generated content to pick from. some of the content even patches glitches and mess ups made by bathesda. im gonna be honest i love skyrim alot, but i love the mods that keep the game alive a lot more. i can check every day and find new content for skyrim. reccomended mods: all patch related mods and falkstaar.",1
"awesome game. some great community mods as well. :)",3
"murdering chickens will get you killed. i have played this sience it came out many years ago, and i still love it! 11/10",1
"no lollygagging but this game stole my sweetrole from me",1
"well structured, difficult, however long and rewarding game... reccomended for people who want a full fledged experience in an rpg, so much lore to the elder scrolls franchise. 10/10 would bang",1
"a masterpiece from the xx century: great graphics and music, huge map and variety of quests, interesting storyline and a big amount of weapons, armor, potions, enchantments, etc. almost the same game style as fallout 3 (being that it was made by the same company), but instead of guns, we have medieval weapons: swords, knifes, axes, bows, even a big amount of magic spells. the level up system works not just by killing people and creatures, but by performing different actions, such as sneak by, selling stuff, archery, different magic schools, theft, alchemy and more. even though the game looks like a fps, i think its a fair game when it comes to battles and it has the posibility to change camera views. what it makes it unique from the other sequels is that the main enemies are dragons which you have to fight and defeat throughout the game. a fully recommended game which takes quite a lot hours to be beat and another amazing game from bethesda softworks.",1
"awesome game, all the millions of mods will keep you busy beyond the basic game for years.",1
"i would recommend any elder scrolls game to any gamer. it has nothing to do with visuals, tho skyrim keeps up the beautiful visuals and artistic diversity of the series. this, like its predecessors, has a huge amount of replay value built-in, with unlimited skill combinations, a mind-boggling amount of places to discover and explore, and countless quests, even without bethesdas top-notch dlc. factor in all the free content from the mod community, and an elder scrolls game can entertain for years.",3
"most favorite game ever played besides my lag issues 10/10!",1
"this game is amazing! there are soo many side quests, it is really hard to get back to the main story :) it leaves you with many possibilities. be good or bad. become a mage, or if you got bored switch to fighter. slay dragons and eat their souls! maybe the only flaw is that you have hardly any conversation options with your followers. they basically have no personality. 9.5/10",1
"the greatest elder scrolls game so far, a must have for all rpg fans",1
"fantastic game with good dlcs - just beware, you are not going to finish the main quest line fast for enhanced gameplay, get these mods: - unofficial skyrim patch + unofficial patch for dlc (fixes lots and lots of glitches and bugs, pretty much mandatory) - skyrimui (better interface for inventory, really handy)",1
"i used to have a full time job working in it, until i took an arrow in the knee.",1
"best game ever. i cant stop playing it. ive bought a lot of games for the winter sale on steam, but i simply cannot stop playing this to try them.",1
"what can really be said about this game that hasnt been echoed by everyone who has played this game and liked it. the graphics are vibrant and detailed. the world is massive and filled with personality (well, when youre on quests that involve those characters anyways). the gameplay is tight and vastly improved from the clunky mess that was oblivions combat system. the mods add hours among hours of gameplay to the already expansive experience. all in all, the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an amazing game that will devour your life and lead to hours and hours of fun, so id recommend this title highly, with eveything given to you and how much this game will last, its well worth the price. not even mentioning the dlc, which extends the amount of fun content with vampire lords, a more extensive houselife, and a return to an island off the coast of morrowind. buy it, assuming you havent already!",1
"very fun rpg! theres so much to discover with all the quests! this game is very fun by itself and even better with mods!",1
"the elder scrolls v skyrim is a really good game, but it does have a lot of flaws but the steam work shop and other mods can change anything you dont like, but overall the game has a nice world to explore, im 50+ hours in the game and i am still finding new locations, the combat however feels like a spam fest, my main problem with the game is the game treats you like a muscular nord tank, concidering a lot of npcs call you a nord in a lot of cases i felt this does ruin the point of being a elf or something, now the main story i didnt like, its intresting but i just found non of the characters memerable, the voice acting is rather bad, but why do i keep playing because of the idea of being in a fantasy world and you can do basically what ever you want. so if you dont mind flaws like this skyrim is a really good game, the dlcs arent really that impressive honestly but the game is good and will influence future rpgs im sure of it.",1
"combat could use some work but the amount of enjoyable content more than makes up for it.",1
"skyrim is a genre unto itself. if you like rpgs with epic storytelling, have deep-seated kleptomania, or fancy yourself a bloodthirsty sociopath, then look no further! this is the game is for you! the greatest part about skyrim is that once you beat it you can simply add/remove mods, and bam! its like a brand new game. warning: modding side effects may include lost days browsing nexus mods, adding/removing/rearranging mods endlessly, and only playing the game itself for 5 minutes at a time. 10/10 - just shut up and give bethesda your money.",1
"10/10 will leave lydia to fight a troll and run away again.",1
"as of writing this review, ive put about 60 hours into skyrim. all ive done is beaten the thieves guild, and i really dont feel like doing the main campaign because it now seems out-of-character for the role im playing. when i re-roll, ill definitely play the main quest, however, but until then i think ive got a good grasp on skyim. its pretty much another elder scrolls game. do what you want, yakety yak, but it fixes a lot of oblivions problems. though if i go into said fixes, id be here all day, and i feel like im telling this to everyone who knows this anyway. in short: if you already hated oblivion, skyrim wont change a thing. if you want a more refined oblivion, go for it. skyrim is a top game for those who love the do-anything immersion that the elder scrolls games bring, even if the writing is ho-hum, the graphics barely above average, and the setting very generic. 4/5",1
"buy this game. now. it is the best open world rpg you can purchase. end of story.",1
"immersion, modifications, nsfw, music, skyboxes, sweeping vistas, spooky caves. recommended.",1
"grabbed legendary edition for $20....a steal at this price. if you let it, it will take you on a wild ride. prepare to start playing at 10pm and look to up to see 5am. its that good.",1
"real fun, extencive open word with a lot of detail. i enjoyed my playthrough more without mods than with mods but it was better with graphics mods. 9/10",1
"quite frankly, anyone that gives this game a bad review is a blatant liar or blind. this game is the pinacle of the elder scrolls series and is made in such a way that general and hard core es fans can love. if you are a max-min player you can make deadly one hit kill weapons and impenetrable armor (and then set it to hardest difficulty) or literally spend hours decorating the over 8! houses you can own the the game. the mods alone add litearlly hundreds of hours of non-repetitive play. this is the benchmark that all other rpgs should be set to. bethesda took their greatest strengths from fallout and implemented them into es. nuff said.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim ein klasse spiel mit sehr langer spielzeit, vielfalt und detailverliebtheit. das spielen macht eine mordsmigen spa und es wird auch nicht langweilig, weil an jeder ecke eine neue quest auf dich wartet. grafisch ist das echt inordnung und ist mit anderen triple a titeln gleich auf. das gesamt paket gefllt mir und bekommt deshalb 95 von 100 punkten: the elder scrolls v: skyrim its a very good game with a long gametime. there are quests at every corner and you cant stop gaming if you played skyrim one time. the graphics are very good and i didnt find a lot of bugs. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is as good as another triple a titles like far cry 3 or assasins creed 3. if i could rate this game i would give 95% of 100%.",1
"this game is amazing!!! skyrim is in my opinion one of the best games i have ever played and i think that it is the best game in the series. this open-world game is truly that, open. you can do anything you want in this game, so for example you could want to be a warrior in the beginning, but it is still completely possible to decide you want to try to level up as a thief or mage without there being restrictions on what you can level up with like in other games in the series. i have skyrim on consoles as well, and this version is just as great, and possibly even better because of mods and improved graphics if your computer can handle it. basically, this game is pure, fantastic freedom, and deserves all the praise it gets.",1
"great game for fans of the elder scrolls. a big rpg which can be played through multiple times + great mods to make the game even better. worth a try even for the most critical of rpg players. nb: this is a not a very hardcore rpg game for those who have explored the genre for a long time it might not be complex enough.",1
"ever wanted to punch a dragon, then realise how stupid that was? neither did i, but i still played this game.",2
"great game it has an amazing story and awesome graphics",1
"10 out of 10! everybody on earth needs to play this! i love you skyrim!!!!!!!!!!",1
"it is fallout with dragons!!!! but no peter dinklage.",1
"i love it you can punch things and shout at you enemies",1
"awesome, hours and hours of my gaming life absorbed. mods extend that to the nth degree. played it as every archetype you can imagine and its a new game.",1
"this game is so awesome that no words can describe it!!!",1
"for the most part, skyrim succeeds wherever oblivion failed. everything has been improved upon. the world isnt just larger, its almost living, randomized and leveled to your character. combat is less repetative, leveling is easier and more meaningful, and skyrims magic system stands as one of the bastions of superb rpg design. unfortunently, techincal gliches and balance issues are still present in skyrim (a staple of bethesdas handiwork), but its nothing game breaking, and its definently shouldnt deter you from adding a title as organic and personal as skyrim to your gaming collection.",2
"skyrim is easily in my top 5 games of all time. graphics wise it looks pretty good but it has a bad render distance but if you use mods... 0_0, amazing. there are no set classes so if you want to be a mage you can still wear armours and use swords. a ridiculous amount of mods so the game is pretty much has no end :d.",1
"with the exception of the bugs its an amazing game.",2
"brilliant story, fantastic atmosphere and all of those mods!!. 10/10",1
"a truly amazing game from start to finish. i was never a fan of elder scrolls, i thought morrowind and oblivion were super boring, but skyrim has changed my tune. an almost endless game, i suggest every single gamer in the world pick this one up.",1
"wonderful game, very versitile, and lots of quests to do. i just wish that the difficulty curve was a little higher the further up you go in level. it gets too easy to slay dragons.",1
"mhhh how to describe the elder scrolls v: skyrim.... e p i c this game is the best openworld/rpg game i ever saw! you can go everywhere! you can do what you want! you can make your own story, you are dovakiin!",1
"omg! this is game is a massive! ive got so many quests to complete. everytime i run into someone theyre always asking for my help. since im so nice, i cant refuse. fortunately ive been keeping track of everything in my journal so i will eventually get to helping everyone if i dont get side-tracked with just exploring the world.",1
"sweet mother teresa on the hood of a mercedes-benz, this game sounds like a majestic f*ckin eagle! and it is, especially with how many amazing modders there are making amazing mods",1
"fantastic game, especially with all the workshop mods!",1
"if you want to say: hey, i just finished skyrim then dont play this game. you dont finish skyrim because it is a world, not a game. almost all of the secondary quests are amazing, some of them are also as good as the main quest. you can have a lot of different playstiles like half mage half warrior, marksman assassin... also, the number of mods that there is in nexus adds a lot more variety to the world. i just love this game, sometimes i enter skyrim just to go to falkreath mounted on arvak and sleep at the dead mans drink at night and then i just go kill some dragons and clear a big dungeon. i love this game, 100% recommended ah...the life of a hero.",2
"skyrim is a nice game to look at. a big game to explore. a lot of mods for it, but. this game to me, lacks content and you need to mods to full fill the game. the ui is bad. the body animations is stiff and ugly. the conversations are boring and when a homeless man has the same voice as a king. the game is nice if someone is in it for the exploration and the nice views. but if you remove that the game is shallow and not worth the price. the hype, the mods and the views it the big + the shallow roleplay elements, the boring combat (dark messiah had better), the game is praised for graphics, yet animations on monsters and races look stiff and ugly (dark messiah had better!) and you need mods to fix some things in it that bethesda themself should have fixed. i would go with something inbetween yes and no for this but there is only two options and i say no. it won the title of rpg of the year on release and it is seen as one of the best rpgs ever, this is wrong. the elder scrolls do the open world, big map, exploration good but the rp parts are flawed and the civil war in the game have no big consequences for the game at all. bethesda can do better and should do better! not relying on modders to repair broken things or things never added which should been in the game.",1
"the rpg against which all other rpg are compare. 10/10.",1
"this game runs like a dream on my pc and i have the minimum requiremants, and i have it on high settings too! highly fun gameplay coupled with smooth performance makes me a very happy customer and i bet it will make you happy too!",1
"great game, loved it on the xbox and for 3.74 what a deal, fin and enjoyable games plus those ,pds",1
"seriously, who doesnt own this game at this point?",1
"ive played this game for 160 hours, with multiple starts, but never finished the main story. i always get distracted by a side quest or on a mission to level up alchemy or enchanting or something. i think that this winter i will make a special effort to complete the main story, ill just start a new character and get right to it, no distractions .... oooh hearthfire dlc...",1
"i love this gameee:warning:highly addictive.......dont say i didt warn you.",2
"i absolutely adore this game. it has so many possibilities its unbelievable. there is nothing not to love about it, there is something for everyone.",1
"a medium long campaing does not distract from the obvious beauty of this game. skyrim lives up to the elder scrolls legacy. wonderful game play, amazing combat, hundreds of locations, and hundreds of side quests. this game will keep you on your toes for many months.",2
"this game is far the best i have ever played. i strongly recommend it.",1
"the best elder scrolls yet, even with the elder scrolls online...",1
"i love the whole elder scrolls series, but skyrim is the second best one, the only one thats better is the elder scrolls iv: oblivionm because that was the elder scrolls game that brought me into the series :) but skyrim is absolutely a game that i recommend buying!! hours of hours of exploring land, mountains, dungeons etc, and freaking killing dragons! 5/5!!",1
"this is one of the best games ever created in my opinion. the skyrim is jus so immersive and a major upgrade from its predecessor oblivion, and morrowind. although their are alot of bugs they arent big enough to effect gameplay too much. and with the pc version you can get mods from the steam community and the nexus, in my opinion skyrim and the elder scrolls series in general is a much better franchise than call of duty. thats right call of duty is childs play compared to the sandbox style games bethesda has thrived off of!!!!!!!",4
"hard to give a recommendation for this game when it pretty much does it itself. i do recommend mods though, sweet sweet mods.",2
"worth getting for the mods alone. other than that its an amazing experience. 93/100",1
"love this game. would recomend to all of my friends for one of the best rpgs on the market.",1
"definitely an amazing game that can never get old. i decided to buy it for the pc after having played it a lot on the console, which was a great choice. for those deciding between regular skyrim and the legendary edition, legendary is certainly worth the extra dollars to get awesome dlcs like dawnguard.",1
"i would reccomend this to anyone who have played open world games like gta or minecraft.",1
"a great roleplaying game with many things to do. the possibilities are endless. all you need is some mods and you can play for a lifetime, im out... fus ro dah",1
"great game even if it is 3 yo, you will never regret spending your money in this game",1
"modded skyrim is amazing! the console version is so limited! from graphics to immersion everything can and has been been tweaked so much. pc skyrim destroys the consoles hands down! before my pc i put maybe 300 hrs into xbox version. im at 800+ on pc and still going. no way i would have even cracked 400 on xbox!",4
"utterly engrossing, its easy to become lost in the world of skyrim. its also easy to feel incredibly overwhelmed at the amount there is to do, something that turned me off the fourth elder scrolls game, oblivion. skyrim, however, seemes more balanced for the inexperienced player and there is plenty to do. i find it easy to focus on one goal; put myself in the shoes of my character and go with what they would do rather than try to do everything.",1
"good game, you should get it now and i mean now :)",1
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"if what you want out of a game is a huge world, hundreds of character options, and infite possibilites, then skyrim is really in a class of one. after over 600 hours of play i am still discovering new aspects of the game.",5
"probably the best and most worth game especially for the price you pay for it. endless hours of amazment",1
"the only reason i can really recommend this game is because the modding community is the only community still holding this game together, apart from the dlc this game isnt too interesting at its core. as to whether its rushed, or just generally lazily designed i wouldnt honestly know. its functional; has its fair share of bugs and glitches, but is still playable right to the end. personally i dont like elder scroll games, but thanks to the modding community this game actually becomes somewhat enjoyable. so download nexus mod manager and turn a solid 5/10 game, into around a 7-8/10! thank you nexus mod manager for making games playable again! :)",1
"if youre a fan of the elder scroll series, id definitely recommend picking up skyrim. if youve never played the series, but are looking for a game that has a massive open world with interractive npcs set in a magical medieval fantasy world, skyim is a great choice. not only is the vanilla version great, but the community mods take the game to a whole new level.",1
"easily the game i have played the most on steam. loved this game so much i bought it for the xbox as well. all told, i have probably played through every quest at least twice in this game, and the main quest at least 8 times between two platforms. if you like rpg, or havent tried the elder scrolls games before, definitely try this game.",1
"worthy addition to the series. oblivion was a letdown and skyrim returns to morrowinds unique feel and personality, though it can not fully match it. skyrim is still a must play for elder scrolls fan and any player who enjoys adventure and exploration. the game becomes phenomenal with mods, you can feel and live through every moment, every battle and encounter. best way to play skyrim is to roleplay your character, commit to its personality and view the world through its eyes. you can really fire up your imagination, break free of scripted dialogues and storyline and live through your own story and adventures. this will open up whole new way for you to play and enjoy games, no longer a mindless consumer addicted to snippets of pre-writen script pieces, you can forge your own story with every step you make. better yet, start a journal or video series describing and documenting your adventures, get off your read only stasis and start being creative. open world, sandbox, free adventuring are endless fun and possibilities. stop being silly puppet unable to think something fun up without explicit designer instructions, would you kindly? for mods you can check this great thread.",2
"great game. hours of fun. wish i would have bought the legenday edition instead.",1
"the best of the single player rpgs... i have to say im not the biggest fan of the genre and havent played that many either but still a diamond among the mass! enjoyed all those 60 hours (and counting) and has played only one character without the dlcs. with hd texture packs you get the most of it if you have the iron. sadly the dungeon clearing quests get pretty repetitive...",1
"your live is a failure -- give it another go in skyrim. oblivion perfection!",1
"this game is guaranteed to at least ruin your life for 50 hrs + and then some hehe enjoy miki",1
"it feels like never ending, have to play. great game!",1
"fun game with or without mods from steam workshop or from nexusmods (best 1) this game is a must get!",1
"theres a mod that puts thomas the tank engine in the game 420/69 would play again",1
"wildly addicting with hundreds upon hundreds of hours of game play. you wont be disappointed.",2
"whats your life without a few hundred more hours? why get a job, make friends, and read books in real life when you can do that in a mythical land of dragons, vampires and magic? exactly.",1
"ok i think everyone knows what i have to say about this game... i love almost all the bethesda games, so there is no surprise that i love this game. skyrim is just another one of bethesdas master pieces in my opinion, this is a true open world experience with so many choices, i do kinda like this game a little better then some on the fallout games because of open world, in skyrim you can keep walking and find a ton of stuff (caves, quests, towns, etc), where in fallout there is not too much to find. so i would give skyrim a 10/10 just because of how amazingly awsome it is. also steam workshop yaaaaaaay!",1

"this game is one of the best i played in a long time, it has fantasy, realistic gameplay, and great graphics! buy it and play it.",1
"this is one of the best games i ever played (i played a lot of games trust me) . this is an epic open world rpg, the graphics are awesome, the story is awesome (i really like it cuz i love dragons ;d ) you nearly have unlimited quests and a giant world to explore and challenges to master. you can easily spend 150 hours on this game and its still not boring (not like other games after 10 hours of playing story is over). and because of the steam workshop you can load unlimited mods, new quests, extend the world, new weapons and many other things. 11 out of 10 because of pure awesomeness ;)",1
"its like skyrim with skyrim yepp... that was it why are you still here? this is skyrim! buy it already! go play",1
"one of the best rpg games around and een once u have done all the main stuff the dlcs r very fun to contuine on with",1
"modded the game so much its not even skyrim anymore 69/10",1
"this game has so much content that its ridiculous. if you have not played this awesome game then get it and get on it yo!",1
"i must tell you now: if you havent played this game, you fail as a gamer. if you havent tried the many mods, you fail (just a little). what makes the elder scroll series so amazing is the amazing story telling and modding community. the story starts off the same as other tes titles, you are a prisoner and then after some miraculous event, freed and nobody cares and it turns out you are some amazing person destined for awesome things. the modding community takes everything up to 11, from redrawn textures to entire dlc sized packs and rescripted events (like a civil war that actually has fights). so if you are still thinking, stop and suit up dragonborn and start fus-ro-dahing your enimies off the next cliff (or having the dragons sound like randy savage with macho mods oh yeah!)",1
"what a amazing game!! longest game ever but very enjoy to play every single quest",1
"this is honestly the best game i own. even though its almost 3 years old at this point, its as good as anything on the market right now. highly recommended!",1
"expansive world with so so many (sometimes repetetive) quests, but generally excellent gameplay, a brilliantly immersive world.",1
"i like this game because it has mind blowing graphics and so many things to do, if only i was good at it. everytime i am in combat with an enermy e.g ice troll, giant, ice wrath and dragon, dispite have gone to the secret item room and getting all the best weopons and armor, i still die, not even a daidric lord came help me. p.s. i alway have to get my friends to help/do it for me.",1
"dragons, dangerous animals, bandits, and a civil war. the majority of my deaths come from jumping off cliffs.",1
"amazing game, the workshop community makes the game even better.",1
"dis game does indeed have a sky. goodjob guys 8/7 ohh yeahhhh- macho man randy savage",1
"why are you even reading this? buy the game already!",2
"you know, while listening to the complete soundtrack of skyrim, i just realized how epic, amazing, beautiful and awesome this game is. one of the greatest games ever created, for sure. we have to thank bethesda every single for this amazing piece of art and entretainment. if you wanna have a great time and walk through one of the most beautiful places of game history, just buy skyrim and note this: add some modes to it, youll not regret.",1
"addictive as hell and ill be playing 24/7 without relizing half the time. i played from 8 a.m to 6 a.m the next day and didnt relize it till i looekd over to the clock.",1
"i would have bought the expansions if it wasnt more expensive to buy them than it is to buy the legendary edition.",1
"best game around with a great setting and you can do what ever you like with an insane amount of mods. nothing much else to say...(well a tonne but cba to write it =o)",1
"great game with a lot of depth and hours of gameplay.",1
"you know, i didnt like this game at first, because it wasnt just a prettier morrowind. as i played it and the land of skyrim opened up to me, it grew on me, however. i do miss every npc having a dialog box and im not sure i care as much about the people as i did in morrowind, but i am enjoying the game a great deal.",1
"what a awesome game the map size the stroyline(s) the gamplay all excell beyond expectaions and also the communty input in this game is amazing! however there is one nag that is the devs seem to leave there products with gliches but this is miner due to the communty updates",1
"the elder scrolls: skyrim is a game, wich you cannot describe with words. skyrim is a nice place, with lots quests to aquire and complete with style. also, skyrim, as a game is incredibly customizable experience, since you can build your own hero as you want it to be. you can choose to be bad or good, and choose your own behaviour and things you do. also the combat system and customization is incredibly advanced and stylish. you wish to be an archer in long distance combat, and a heavy melee on close combat, be my guest, skyrim will be the place to do it. the graphics of skyrim are very nice and realistic but there are many modifications in workshop wich will allow the higher end computers to use the lost power and make skyrim even better on the graphics and realism. and last but not least, i would recommend skyrim to any gamers that wish to get a good storyline, an action filled adventurous medieval simulator :d",1
"1/10 worst ing racing game ever. are you even trying, bethesda?",1
"skyrim is my favorite game of all time by far. every pixel, every dialogue, and every single quest had 110% effort put into it. the enviromental graphics look visually stunning. people upload screenshots of amazing views from mountaintops and forests as if they were scenic views from real life. anyways, i definitely recommend this game. great work, bethtesda softworks. 6 out of 5 stars. -dovahdude",1
"this game is amazing its defenatly equal to the other great elder scrolls games. i would defenatly recomend it to somone who has either played the previous games or just wants to get into the elder scrolls franchise. have fun and enjoy the game, i hope youve found this usefull.",1
"this game does not work on my laptop and it sucks because i spent 20 on it and cant even play it please get rid of it off my account and refund me.",1
"one of the greatest games ill ever play. has a mod for practically everything. from killing children, to bouncing boobs, and to better graphics.",1
"going through my game list i just saw that i have over 400 hours on this game. i dont understand, how this is possible. i havent even finished the main quest yet. barley began the quest line of the first expansion, and not even finished the starter quest of the second expansion. i have yet to fully explore skyrim. of the 8 holds (skyrim districts) i only explored 5 of them. i dont know how many more hours it will take me until i finished the main quest and the two expansions. how many more to see everything, but thank i godi took breaks playing this game. because if you play straight from start to finish, having maybe over 1000 hours of play behind you, you will be fluid in the ancient dragon tongue, recite the theme song from your memory and likely need a guidance consular to help you take your first steps back in the real world. so immersive is this game experience. in the years to come it wont be possible to take people serious that havent played this game.",2
"this game....is hideously complicated. i say this in all love of that particular aspect of the work, but i must preface any glowing recommendation (and this is one) with that small acknowledgement - be prepared to devote long leisure hours and short daydreams to this world, and now you shall be forever changed; either into a fan or into some broken wreak, snivelling at a keyboard in fear of the mere word thuum.....",2
"one of the best games ever made, simply amazing, epic, awesome, magnificent !!!",5
"this is the most entertaining and attention catching games that you will ever play. despite the fact it is already more than 3 years old it is still one of the best games i will ever play.",1
"love it. its a work of art. one of the best storylines in games and the open world is fun to get lost in. mods keep this game going on and on and expanding it.",1
"ive played this game both vanilla and modded, and it is by far one of the best games that i have ever owned. :)",4
"if you enjoy reading and listening to people talk, then this game is the game for you",1
"its skyrim....... if you havent got it or havent played it yet, you are missing out on something we will all be talking about in the old folks home in the future.",1
"so much god damm fun i played the ps3 version and it wasnt even to close as good as this one. the load time are way faster and the mods on it man dont even get me started",1
"hands down the best game i have ever played. a legend of the video game world.",2
"ive been playing this series ever sincemorrowind on the xbox and skyrim is the most complete game in the series to date. would you liketo be a vampire lord, or perhaps a draon riding samurai? with an endless world t explore and thousands of different ways to play i cant help but recomend skyrim along with all the dlc. fair warning though, be sure to step outside once in a while or it will consume you.",1
"one of the best games of all time, and best bethseda game ( coming just after fallout 3 and nv). the graphics are amazing, the story and side quest have pure genius thinking into them. there is a crap ton of stuff to do in this game like makeing a house ( hearthfire dlc, a must), crafting weapons and armour, mining, joining clans such as the dark brotherhood or the theives guild, killing random beasts, collecting items, getting a wife & kids, ( hf dlc), and stealing peoples . i would give this game a 9.5/10 and it would be in my top 10 games of all time list. -connor",1
"i frickin love it ! i have played this game forever and it never ends wow ! i actually think that you will never see or do all the things you can do in this game. well worth whatever you have to pay to get it. what i like the most is no internet is required talking bout old school install and play....thank the gods ! there are not enough hrs in the day to play this game. mods are out standing and plentiful. when world of warcraft server was down i could always fall back on skyrim, no log in required, no password no internet just launch and continue where you left off....no cloud to deal with, no strain on system resources, no third party app to deal with. prior elder scroll games are the same....just do it if you love hack and slash, magic and dragons in your face first person or third person style....your choice.",2
"its alight i guess..... then you mod it and its amazingomgwthawesomesaucecoolsuper!!!!!!",2
"this game is extremely addicting and extremely fun. when i started playing, i was automatically hooked. good job bethesda.",1
"amazing game and awesome workshop content and nice dlcs also nice side quests",1
"one of the most spectacular games ever made. the gameplay and modding community for this game is simply amazing. with the right mods you can actually make this game look next gen for free! highly recommend to all rpg/fps style gamers.",1
"the reason i have never got around to writing a review for skyrim is that ive been too busy playing it. you know its a good game when you suddenly realise how many hundreds of hours youve spent playing it. if you like a thousand nooks and crannies for you to explore, skyrims for you. if you some fun combat, skyrims for you. if you like immersive lore and detailed histories, skyrims for you. if you like a huge modding community, skyrims for you. what else can i say, apart from if you dont have it, get it.",1
"awesome game. hourse of entertainment and a full world to explore as you choose the path you want your character to take.",2
"you can get a graveyard mod and bury everyone you dont like.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played. skyrim is a snowy and unforgiving place that has been struck by war. the imperials and the stormcloaks fight for the land and the freedom of skyrim. then there is you; a prisoner (like in all of the elder scrolls games) captured by the imperials and sentenced to death, and out of all of a sudden a dragon appears and attacks the local town you are in. the rest of the game is all up to you and your decisions.",1
"buy this game...or else..................fus ro dah",1
"you would be  not to waste your life on this epic game.",1
"skyrim is a very good game, i highly recommend that you play this! i have spent a long time on this and not a second was wasted :d",1
"9/10 only because i miss some things from morrowind and oblivion. epic game anyway!",2
"skyrim v is an amazing game in which the character is a dragonborn, a man with the soul of a dragon. using this he can learn shouts, or thuums to aid him in combat. the gameplay and graphics in skyrim is amazing, with a lot of different combinations for your characters. the items are extensive, and the enchantments you can put on them are amazing. also, you can forge weapons and armor made from anything from leather to dragon bone. you can make poisons and potions to help you in combat and hinder the enemy helpless, and using a grindstone you can make your weapons even more powerful. using the skill tree you can learn special traits to help you, whether it be in forging or pickpocketing. all in all, skyrim v is an amazing game and if you are thinking about getting it,, you diffinitely should.",1
"if this game was a potato it would be a good potato 15/10",1
"i use to be an adventuer like you but then i took an arrow to the knee. killed every guard who said this 10/10 would do again.",1
"spawned 10 dragos in whiterun with console game crashed 10/10",2
"do you really need another review to convince you to get the game? skyrim is one of the greatest games of all time - if not for the great graphics, engaging environment, variety of equipment, and vast mod community, the massive open world setting and hundreds of hours of quests and storylines make this game nearly unbeatable. to be fair there are some small shortcomings, often in gameplay balance and such, but virtually any shortcoming you can think of has a mod to resolve it. the content from both the game and the community make skyrim a nearly endless game. overall 9.7 / 10 stars feel free to check out the mods that i have created as well, i have over 15 different mods uploaded to the workshop for your enjoyment :)",2
"this is my favorite game i have ever played on steam. great graphics, big world, dragons! i cant stop playing.",1
"really fun game one of my most favorite games of all time. i really enjoy the big open world that skyrim has to offer, i also enjoy all the mod you can find out there that make skyrim that much better. skyrim just one of those games where you can spend hours, weeks, on quest and still have many thing to do. i definitely rate skyrim 10/10!",2
"such an awesome game, you can be enthralled by it for days at a time by exploring the vast amount of places and quests, youll be busy for a while if you get it.",1
"one of the best games ever so many mods on the workshop and nexus it adds hours of fun after you finish in-0game providsed content",1
"one of the best games ive ever played! even being as old as it is, i havent found another game that offers the amount of gameplay and pure awesomeness that skyrim has given!!! i recommend this game to any1 looking for a long lasting and challenging game.",1
"skyrim! slicing, cutting, gutting, burning, freezing, shocking and many more ways to kill anything that stands in your way!",3
"this game is amazing it ias so large so open hours of fun can be had with just the game itself however the expantion packs just add more.",1
"its a game that has stuff. played as werewolf lizard man vampire that yells at things until they die. would recommend. pi / 5",1
"still a great game to this day. mods keep it alive and plenty of things to do with it.",1
"great game. good story if you want and a whole world to explore if you dont. more quests and things to do than i will ever have time for. but best of all i get to go dragon hunting ;-)",1
"i played skyrim for a few days solid. then not much after that. skyrim, i feel, suffers from the sheer amount of stuff to do which kind of ends up being fetch quests. too many quests and too many places to go for too petty of an objective. skyrims greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. its so huge and theres so much to do, theres nothing to do.",1
"once you spend 80 hours getting all your mods to work, it isnt that bad of a game.",1
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"i will never get tired of this game. playing it is like stepping into another world and living there in my offtime. highly recommended :)",1
"first i was hesitating to buy this game but finally i got this game on summer sale for 5$. this was the first rpg game i ever played, earlier i use to hate this genre but this game made me change my mind. i have put 100 hours into this game and still i feel i havent even completed 25% of this game.and even if u somehow manage to end this game(which is impossible :p), there are tons of mods on steam workshop and nexus to add more missions, quests etc. the only bad thing is that i played this game on my laptop and never had a chance to play it on ultra settings and other fancy mods like enb series, skyrim 2k textures, etc, but i finally manage to build a good pc and im ready to invest 100 more hours into this beautiful creation from bethesda :d actually this was more like my story rather than a review but still i shared my experience and highly recommend this game.",1
"always have loved rpgs but never have the time for them but after picking this game up during the steam summer sale i was surprised at how much fun it is and enthralling it is. basically do you want to become a clepto / hoarder thief or a mage that ends up using amazing spells or just a warrior that rushes in to flee from bears but not from dragons? the answer is yes and just the amount of backstory and lore inside of this game can keep you entertained for many playthroughs and i still have yet too finish the game but the amount of quests and just exploring skyrim in its entirety keeps you excited what can i find in this cave oh a bunch of bandits whats this switch at the end of the cave woah i opened a dwemer passage into some ruins. i recommend this game if anything i mentioned is what you like in a game this game is perfect for you. and as of yet i have not purchased any dlc but i am planning onto and will update this review further down the road.",1
"great game.. epic feel to playing the way you want .do what you want. go anywhere. love it",1
"personally the best action/adventure rpg game ive ever played. you can play the game over and over and over again, and you still wont get bored of it because there is simply too many choices too make, too much quests to finish in a large variety of ways. 10/10",1
"i was walking around when a greybeard decided to shout me and threw me off a cliff. 10/10 would get shout again.",1
"love it, can play play play, then leave it and come back again and again. love the mods you can get.",1
"a very fun fps?, rpg. this game provides lots of things to do, explore, fight, and discover. you will find yourself captivated by this game for hours no matter what kind of games you are into. the only problem for me would be the slowness of the armor and weapon upgrades and all the real-time traveling",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. endless opurtunity to do whatever the hell you want. you can play however you want, be whatever you want. ive probably played 300 hours (but mainly on xbox( of this game and it never gets old. when you play this game on steam make sure you make full use of the endless mods available on the workshop and nexus.",1
"the elder scrolls is my favourite part of the skyrim series <3",1
"this is probably one of the best games ive ever played. ever.",1
"there are so many different ways to play this game, theres a ton of replay. ive sunk a ridiculous amount of time into my xbox 360 version. i recently purchased the pc version because i wanted the faster load times and better graphics. best purchase ever.",1
"skyrim in general is amazing. skyrim on pc is the best  youll ever buy. if youve played it on console, you will feel like it is an rpg, but on pc its a puzzle game, you barely have time to actually play because you mod and you mod your game, making it more and more awesome, then when you feel oh hey, now its perfect itll ctd. you start looking through your mods to see which one is the troublemaker, but you cant find it. so you reinstall skyrim, install a better mod manager, install all your mods (now only with the ones you feel are necessary, but that wont last long) and you jump on, play for 30 minutes and then crash. now you have an idea of which mods are the culprits, so you uninstall them. hop back on and play for a day or so, then install more mods and rinse and repeat. 10/10 amazing simulator for dragging and dropping files.",1
"i am honestly just posting this review to get an acheviement but i decided to do it on this game so that saids a lot.",1
"great game!! even better than oblivion and fallout-new vegas which i have also played. the scenery in skyrim is absolutely awesome. i really feel like im there.",2
"its just one of the best games i love the rpg games grate game and story line :)",1
"one of the best games ive ever played... almost feel sorry for the console players of this game.",1
"mine doesnt work!!!!!!!! fix it please or tell me what to do :(",1
"one of the best games ever created, would highly recommend it to anyone contemplating buying it",1
"incredible, but i felt that some of the main questlines could have been better, but who plays tes games for main questlines!",1
"this game is sooooooo  like omfg derz not evn gunz in it lik caul off doody anyone who says this game is good are a ing retart if you like real gamz play cod it is so good and looks way more graphicly sexy this pece of !!1!!!! plus it runs like  on my 1998 windows 97 laptop witch is teh most powerfulll compuutor ther is!!!!1! and the storie lin is so ing idiotik ther are no sukh thng as draongs but obviossly there are giaunt milatarie robotz that can kill muslims from 100000000000000000000000 miles away so stop call ing dis xcus 4 a gam gudddddd!

"i used to be a real person like you... then i took skyrim to my life... 8.5/10! :d",1
"this game is simply amazing. ive already sunk in around 100 hours and dont feel tired of it at all. just a massive epic quest. the reviews are all right on this one. you really feel like youre on an epic adventure and its completely nonlinear. play how you want, at your own pace.",1
"this game is epic fun and gives over 200 hours of gameplay just by its self if you buy the dlcs dawnguard and dragonborn you can get even more hours out of the game but dont forget mods and new characters!",3
"amazing, its skyrim, what more can i say about the legendary rpg?",1
"an impressive immersive jaw dropping experience. this game is any free-form rpgers dream.",2
"killed an entire city and went to jail because the chickens witnessed the crime. 13/10 realistic as",1

"skyrim is beautiful, polished and outright amazing! :d all the  issues in oblivion have been resolved far as i can see :) love this game!",1
"such a great game. its big, awesome and ... and i dont know the right words. for everyone who likes fantasy, rpgs and/or want to try something in that direction, this is musthave",3
"its really fun. and for anyone whos played it on console, imagine it like that for the pc ....except you can mod, use the console, and generally have a better game experience.",1
"do you like magic, or swords, or dragons, or just all of them? then this is the game for you!",2
"how can you not reccomend this game. the scope is huge, the quests are plentiful, the gameplay and graphics are still amazing. you will lose many hours of your life with this game happily.",1
"amazing, immersize game with plenty of content for you to explore. slay dragons and follow the path of being the destined dragonborn or forget the prophecy and murder dozens of innocents. choices are plenty and with the memmorable cast of characters, vanilla skyrim is a delight easliy lasting over 80 ours of true, immersize, gameplay. with mods, skyrim itself immerse you further into the lore or completley disregard it. mods are very crucial to me and my experience, so if you get this game, then make sure to download mods from the workshop or nexus. good for: rpg fans, elderscroll fans, fallout fans, gamers who want and immersive story. beware, like all bethesda games, glitches and crashes are common. 9.5/10",1
"modded the game so much that i made a character with incredibly huge breasts and sexy looking that would do prostitution around skryim. thanks japanese modders!",1
"come on bethesda why must you make my life so perfect!?!?! i cant ever stop after playing it.",2
"this is the best game i have ever played and hands down my favorite!",1
"super awesome game. great graphics. always something to do for example: quests or just going on your own adventure.",1
"90% of the props should go to the modding community instead of bethesda. that being said, be sure youve got yourself some disc space.",1
"this game though. the best fps fighter ive ever played",1
"i love all of series from elder scrolls, till skyrim was released my faworite was oblivion. now i realy like skyrim, bigger map to explore, better dungeons, hardest difficulty, but i miss a bit more daedras, like on oblivion. but for me now best elder scrolls game, and one of my bests rpg games. and with all moders community much better game.",1
"an awsome adventure game with many places to explore.",1
"best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! with sharpshooters classic enb, skyrim 2k textures, w.a.t.e.r, lush trees and grass, and 126 more mods. then figuring out which mod causes your game to crash as soon as you hit play. 10/10 would buy 126 more times",1
"if badass was in the dictionary this game would be in there as the definition. enjoy!",1
"what, youre thinking about buying this game and are looking for recommendations? what, are you some sort of ing casual!?",1
"skyrim is skyrim and that game is boss i had the game on my ps3 and played it for days proberly months and i have been watching top 5 skyrim mods of the week with cam and seb. so i brought it on steam to pley it for the mods and to see if my laptop could handle it. the mods where amazing. the skyrim community is really creative. the sad part is i dont think the elder scrolls online even toches skyrim on the leader boards of great games. hope they do better with a non mmo one. 9.9/10 because no games is perfect but this feels like it",1
"do i even need to?, this game is incredible when this game first was first released my pc wasnt built yet so i got for xbox i sunk entire days...no weeks in this game never got bored but when i saw how cool and big the modding scene was for the game i just fainted. i wanted to build a pc so bad! this summer i finally did and it was totally worth it. for the price it offered at now it a complete steal. i got for $7.49 + dragonborn dlc more than enough content to keep your attention for days to come. i strongly! recommend skyrim to anyone! dont let this offer pass you if you dont have it yet.",1

"hey, stop looking up the dictionary for the definition of legendary. its right here.",1
"skyrim is amazing. i recomend this game to everyone i know",1
"the fifth game of the elderscrolls series i found this game pretty fun. lots of sidequest loaads and loads of places to explore all those books to read all that lore. best of all mods lots and lots of mods to spice up the game my only complaint of this game that with out moding controlls, ui and optimization mods the game runs so choppy even on a decent computer the mouse acceleration and worst of all fov ( thankfully you could use the console for that, unfortunately you cannot have your acheivements unlock ), if you have a full inventory or hoarded all those potions and scrolls? having that will make your inventory management a total chore despite all that the games pretty solid and i would recomend this if you like slaying those dragons",1
"one of my favourite games of all time. have you played elder scrolls before? no problem. skyrim is full of fun references to earlier games. its a little different from morrowind and oblivion but still extremely good. i dont feel like ive wasted any money buying this, nor do i feel like ive wasted a single hour. the game is beautiful - i can stop in my tracks and just admire the world. there is so much to do, so many quests: main quests, faction quests, side qeusts, misc quests - youll never be bored. you dont like being bound by quests? no problem. theres no obligation to follow any quests, its possible to just explore and live the world. the levelling is easy and the game offers many different ways to play - rogue, warrior or mage to name a few.",3
"i bought this game when it first came out and i still love it. its well designed and amazingly fun to play without any strategy guides, making finding the secrets challenging but far from impossible if you look closely. one of my all time favourites.",1
"a very good game for people who enjoy rpgs that require skill and nerve to deal with constant world events.",1
">get this game >mod it to oblivion >start the game >ctd >spend all day trying to get it working >now that its stable, play it for a few hours >get bored, stop playing >2 months later >repeat sums up my experience with this game.",1
"this is probably the coolest looking rpg in a while and great gameplay!",1
"took more than a month of my life, legendary game, with mods its even better, must play",1
"surely you mustve heard all the good stuff this game has to offer, yes? well dont go into this game expecting what youve heard. expect much, much more. every time your play skyrim youll notice something new. maybe a quest, item or even a simple little treat that either resembles something like an easter-egg, a whole set of missions, or even going on an adventure after a heavy night of drinking finding out what the hell you did in your drunkness the day after. the game is almost limitless! oh and i didnt even mention the dlc. hands down: the best dlc ive come across in any game so far (the only exception being bioshock infinite: buried at sea). 9.5/10, almost perfect. the absolute only flaw this game seems to have (on me at least) is that the game gets a bit repetitive. this can be fixed pretty easily however if you simply download some of the mods from the steam forum. i rated the base game but with the workshop included this is a perfect 10/10 solid title. buy it. do it nao! *plz episode 3 confirmed?*",1
"put 120 hours into the ps3 version and got the platinum. after only 2 hours of playing the pc version, i already encountered a quest i had never seen before. even without including the vast mod and community support, this game is an expansive, deep, and gratifying experience. highly recommended.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is the best game ive ever played. the amount of detail and care put into making this game its insane! ive put close to 800 hours into it and im still finding new places, people, and quest. once you finish one quest line, you just move on to the next. from killing dragons and taking their souls, to casting a firestorm spell to wipe out huge amounts of enemys this game has it. the world is yours in this game, and theyre no accidents. be who you wanna be weather it be elf, beast, or man. overall this game is amazing. there are still a few bugs present but just save often and you should be fine. if you want the rpg game of the decade, and hours of dragon slaying and shouting words of power to freeze or burn your foes, then this is it. fus ro dah!",5
"this may or may not be an amazing game. i cant tell. the port from console to pc is so bad that its basically unplayable. the menus are unreadable, the controls are bizarre, the field of view is restrictive, and the amount of head-bobbing induces motion sickness. automatic kill moves take game control away from the player without the players input, often resulting in death. like most console games, one keystroke has many functions, and the game does not even give the option to rebind them, which should be the first requirement for a pc port. dozens of mods and two years later, and i still havent found a way to fix the core issues that are built into the game at its most basic level, the point of user interface. for someone who is used to pc controls, pc monitors and pc games, skyrim is unplayable and unredeemable even with mods.",1
"this is good game 10/10 but not enough naked people so 0/0",1
"its getting a little long in the tooth these days, but its still a beautiful game. mods and graphics enhancements from the steam workshop only make it moreso. even 200 hours in, im still finding new places and people and quests. the replay value of this game is astounding. i cant recommend it enough. unless you want a life away from the computer, in which case you really shouldnt play this game at all.",1
"skyrim is my favorite role playing game. it has depth and great detail. many games i start with a new character can last many months. i do not have anything bad to say about the game that is just how good it is. i recommend this game 100% thank you",3
"15/10 amazing game, everyone need to play this game ;3",1
"for those of you who believe this game is nothing but oblivion 2.0, you can turn around now and go pound sand. still here? good. skyrim is not an expansion or rehash, it is not a waste of time and money, and it can not be missed for any reason.",4
"this gmae is just stunning! the graphics are beautiful the game plays out nice and it has such a great modding community!",1
"get it, marry the man of our dreams, adopt a child, kill the child",1
"this is my personal favorite game of all time. i have a collective total of about a thousand hours put in, and i regret none of them. this is definatly a must have for every gamer.",3
"i really enjoy this game and find it much more enjoyable with mods. they add so much to the experience that im extremely glad i got it on steam rather than a console.",2
"i absolutely enjoyed every minute spent in this game - mostly free roaming and unwittingly finding side quests. strongly recommended. my personal top 10 of all times.",2
"not sure why im writing a review for this game when i could be playing it.",1
"like skyrim with skyrim - ign, probably.. seriously though, this game is brilliant. yes there are bugs galore, but its a bethesda game, what do you expect? it still doesnt detract from the wonderous experience of procrastination you get from playing this game. worth the money at full price, but catch the dlcs on sale, as they really arent.",1
"love it better than elder 4 but all the elder scroos are kool , im also loving the beta testing on the online one too",1
"honestly one of the best games in this generation. it has been the one game to hold my attention for almost 3 years now. i originally bought it for xbox and again now for pc. i would rate it very highly due to its stunning graphics, dynamic quests and captivating story. it lacks simple get this item quests and replaces them interesting dungeons that each have their own story which if you take the time can be fascinating. followers and npcs seem more intellegent than other games and the dlcs add depth and a whole new story. if you play this game, expect hours of exploration and very quality narrative.",1
"totally recommend , it will make you stuck with the game and environment buy it!",1
"pros: its an epic rpg adventure on its own, once you add the dlcs you have a well rounded fantasy world complete with vampires and werewolves. start adding community and nexus mods and look the hell out, i have played through over half a dozen characters and i am still finding new vanilla content. cons: cant play with a controller and still have the keyboard active.",2
"wonderful modding community and pretty good story.",1
"pretty much if you dont own this game, you are a loser.",1
"easily a few hundred hours worth of questing and screwing around. doesnt hurt that it has one of the best workshop communities on steam.",2
"what an amazing game. its my first rpg game. i glad to start rpg with this. skyrim has full of opportunity. every playing hours i discover new things in this epic world. perfect story, a lot of characters, huge world.",1
"bit annoyed i still cant play this game becourse at the beginning of the game the player wont get out of the horse cart",1
"this i sgame is one of my fave. game to play when i play adventure game but it one of the coolest open world games right up the with sleeping dogs if you like open world and adventure games this is a game for you but there is a dlc that is awsome called heart stone i want if some one knows or has it tell me if it is worth the money!?!?",1
"not a great deal to say but this game is definately one of the best of 2011. sure the interface is a letdown but all this can be fixed with any of the ui mods available.",1
"i would play the game, if it wasnt so evil. its a shame because its probably the best garme like it i have ever seen. the combat game mechanics were fantastic, especially the archey, maybe a little easy but extremely fun. i found the dungeons a little less rewarding than oblivion, they all seemed alot more ..... predictable, following the same basic pattern of design from the developers. for example if your 4 levels deep into a particular dungeon, you might not see an exit shortcut cave somewhere, but you will know its there, because the last 20 you been to all had them, convenient maybe, realistic, no. as a player with morales, i tried to avoid the evil in this game, but its different so say ..... star wars, because in that you get a choice. in this game they kinda force you to do evil things through the lineier and locked line of main questing. also, i had no interest in magic as a dedicated archer, but was also forced into taking those dragon crys that are essential for the main quests. just went a little overboard i think with the evil, apart from that, a very good game, but unfortunatly i wouldnt reccomend this to friends.",1
"skyrim is great. great graphics, great gameplay, and great story. i highly suggest.",1
"overall great game. gamplay was smooth, quests intruiging, and definitly worth buying.",3
"this game will make u waste ur life....but its worth it",1
"an epic rpg with huge freedom to explore and shape your character the way you want to.",1
"fantastic rpg, most people will already know that though being an elder scrolls title. immersive open world play will get you hooked, indefinitely. never ending game, with this elder scroll installment you can no longer run out of things to do as the engine generates random quests . great overall and my single favorite game, at least until the next time bethesda releases an elder scroll game.",2
"soo, i was walking around, happy that im the new leader of the thiefs guild, and whaddaya know, my new employee tries to rob me. geez, looks like they are desperate for money arent they. so i just gave him a bonus, in daedric arrows. 10/10",1
"this is a great rpg game, the first person aspect is different from other games of its kind, and its very in depth. i highly recommend. although buyer beware you cant alt+tab out without issues, or change the volume while in game.",1
"so contrary to what my gametime hour log looks like, ive played like 475hours (250 one game, 200 another and 25 on my current one). not only did i spend my time becoming a cave-dwelling game-monger sitting endlessly in a dark void of my room playing this game, but i infected others by showing them this game and they too became cave-dwellers. so now all my friends and i live in a cave. best way to become cave-dwellers. 10/10",1
"its only good with millions of mods :d otherwise its lackluster. ~",2
"cons: i was a little disappointed that theres no sense of urgency with any of the quests. people will make off hand remarks about knowing you, but what you do for one town has no meaningful impact anywhere else. lots of walking compounding the issue with lots of walking, horses are pretty buggy if you dont keep to the roads. very easy to randomly fall to your death over what looks like a tiny drop on a horse. combat is a little bland long, unskippbale cut scene at the begining pros: interesting story great graphics large world good crafting lots of neat player housing great modding comunity overall i thought it was a good game, but maybe not quite as good as all the hype. definitely worth picking up though.",1
"heres what you should do if youre reading the recomendations. scroll up. click buy. inform your family and friends you may be out of contact for a while. and play the damn game already.",1
"one of the best games ever in my opinion. recomended.",1
"after playing skyrim for countless hours on both pc and xbox i can say that for me the pc has a lot quicker loading screens and crashes a lot less than its microsoft console counterpart. i highly reccomend this game for the rpg fan",1
"this game helped me lose weight. playing for 12 hours straight does that i guess.",1
"this is easily one of my favorite games ever; being able to do what ever you want climbing mountains, delving into dangerous dungeons, swimming into slaughterfish infested waters. the graphics are fairly good, the dlc adds hours of new content like weapons, armour, shouts, new monsters and lore to the game. this game has hours of gameplay thousands of quests, loads of creatures to kill and will definatly be worth playing. i find it hard not to get sidetracked with all the random encounters and mission that are going on. i would rate it 4.5/5.",1
"what can i say, its the same old elder scrolls but improved upon in almost every way. glitches still occur in very unlikely and hilarious ways as there always has in the series, but nothing game breaking. well worthy of a permanent spot in your library or collection.",1
"an unrelentingly, unforgiving, uninterruptedly epic experience.",2
"i am a big fan of the elder scrolls series since morrowind and enjoy the story mode a lot and i like doing mods and messing around with them.",1
"how can i describe something so magnificent??!?!?! this is my number 1 game of the year and if you dont like it then im sry to say go get it or you have lost your mind azusas sabertooth 1hiejkdwafaskjlhwdhjakd.",1
"if you have radeon......good luck trying to get it to work.....",4
"absolutely recommend! skyrim has some of the most unique and breathtaking vistas i have ever seen in an adventure game. the first person combat is hugely varied and the game world immersive and just stunning. one drawback is the ever-increasing number of bugs and glitches in the game but usually they do not detract largely from the gameplay.",2
"did you know there is a real world outside tamriel? someone should totally make a mod about that. 100/10 havent felt the warm embrace of another human being for 6 months.",4
"well, i played through it once and spent over 150 hours... i didnt die the hero, i lived long enough to see myself become the villan... for the achievements of course ;)",1
"i put a bag on someones head and stole everything.",1
"i really dont understand why you dont have this already. big open fantasy world where you get to run around and play the game how you want for hours and hours, a thriving mod community, and big ol dragons you get to shout at! whats not to love?",1
"to be honest i was a little dissapointed with skyrim when it came out, i was expecting something absolutely mind-blowing. instead, what i saw was oblivion with new animations and graphics, and i realized that that was all i ever really wanted. the game alone i would rate 8/10 but with mods 10/10 because the modding community for this game is absolutely fantastic, if you get this game be sure to at least check out skyrim nexus and the steam workshop, because there are things in there that allow the game to reach new heights.",2
"this game makes me feel so independant and really brings my true self out for da whole world to see. gurl i dont even use any followers cuz i be a strong independant black woman who dont need no man. whenever i finish a quest i celebrate with some fried chicken and purple drank. i dont even know how to use half the weapons, i just use my fists like back in da hood. this game brings back so many memories of my childhood and my 5 divorces and it feels so sweet.",1
"an amazing open-world with hundreds of different thing to discover, with the option of several different play styles there is always a new way to play it. the modding community on steam and on nexus are beyond belief with new mods every week for the game there is always something new, warning this game will consume you and your life you have been warned!!!!!! i highly recommend this above any game i have played and will ever play.",1
"i keep coming back to this game and i dont know why. modding makes it magical.",1
"this is a little late, but the newest installement of the elder scrolls had me jittering before it was released. i was a huge fan of oblivion and morrowind, and i could not wait for the next one. with all the graphical enhancements over the previous one, i was practically jumping out of my socks when i was pre-ordering it. the gameplay is great, with nice, fast combat, whether youre hacking someone up with a sword or axe, or burning them to a crisp with magic. the story was good, and thanks to the auto-generating quest system, you literally never run out of things to do. thanks to mod support, its become an even more fun game to play, even if you were bored with it. some of the downsides though, are if you are a pc player like myself, it needs a rather demanding setup to play effectively. also, it is absolutely chock-a-block full of glitches. flying mammoths, super-stretchy bandits, and other problems far too numerous to mention. other than its graphical demands and loads of glitches, its a fun, time-consuming rpg. dem draugr death overlords, am i right? (watch out for those ;)",1
"since its pre-alpha release in november 2011, this game has know so many updates (mysteriously called mods) that it sometimes get unplayable. still worth a few hours of good casual enjoyment.",1
"need i say more than this is a game made by bethesda that is an excellent producer with their ultimate strong point being rpgs? just buy it.",1
"f**king amazing game! you like rpg fantasy games? then get this s**t now!",1
"i honestly have to say skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played. a while ago i reached 70 hours on skyrim and thought that i should stop there as i will start running out of things to do soon. recently i redescovered skyrim and made a new character. with the exeption of the starting mission i have played over 100 hours now and all of the quests i have completed have been totally new. i am astounded by the level of detail in this game. 95/100",1
"skyrim is, well its skyrim. i started on the 360 and played the hell out of that with all the dlc to boot, but the pc version is where the game shines. with workshop integration, the replayability of this game skyrockets. i dont know if ill ever be able to return to the 360 version after having played skyrim on the pc. the immersion provided by workshop opportunities gives the game the flavor that i believe it was originally striving for upon release. if you are hesitant about which system to buy it for, there is no question: go pc.",1
"great game, i have played the the elder scrolls since morrowind and the open world style is great! supports a ton of user mods that really enhance the game....different skills cause totally diferent styles of play and practicing to improve is a wonderful skill development model!",1
"first pc game, i got, best pc game i have got, although i wish i had got it from amazon uk as they had the elder scrolls box set all 5 games, all dlc and all for 25. 3,4 and 5 all are steam games on disk. i go the legendry edition of here and only looked back because of the box set. its like a 2nd life. where u can kill peopple by shouting, get killed by a pot and become a master criminal by killing a chicken.... and thats with out the mods! a must get for any one>",1
"if you have never played this game, something is wrong with you...",1
"im at 234 hours of play time vanila skyrim is wonderous but add mods for a true gaming paridise do what you want why you want follow qeusts or dont its just a realy perfect open world game download nexus mod manager to add non steam mods with ease this game will never grow old as you can simply update your graphics mods 10/10 there is no other like it #modittillitcrashes",2
"want a game where you can pretty much do whatever the hell you want? get this game!",1
"this game is an amazing expansion to an already amazing series. adds to the depth of tamriel. game does pose a few issues but other than that it is an excellent buy.",2
"i got to eat cheese in the middle of a battle. best game ever 10/10.",1
"this is my favorite game, honestly i love everything about this game. its story, characters, quests, graphics, and small little details make this game great even after 4 years of its release and hopefully many years to come.",1
"one of the best rpgs of all time. definately worth the time giving it a chance. ive had so many people that dont play games try it out and absolutely love it. give it a shot! 10/10!",1
"amazing story etc and tons of mods and easy to make mods. most user friendly mid age game ever!",2
"amazing. simply amazing. not only when you get done, but from the start. amazing.",1
"the elderscrolls series is one that will never let you down. skyrim did not disappoint and for a series that had already raised the bar so high thats saying something. breathtaking visuals and endless gameplay where you can play however you want. tons of mods and great community as well. in one word epic.",2
"*finally stops playing to take a break* holy  its 5 months later!!!!",2
"heavily modded skyrim is best skyrim. i have over 75+ mods to make it more realistic. it runs smoothly on my pc and skyrim doesnt crash ever. i highly reccommend modding it...like you wont regret it...so yeah",1
"skyrim the sequel to obilvion and possibly the final of the elder scrolls is something that i did not waste that much ing hours into. but it buy it buy it buy it. some much to do and epic soundtrack that has awesome characters great storyline. and something to remember. is everything. i do recommend the unofficial skyrim patch and their unofficial dlc patches. 10 out of 10 now stop finding reviews that disagree and play this game. and go to blackreach.",1
"game with the most perverted mods ever next to oblivion 10/10 they keep coming out with more.",1
"i use to have a real life like you, then i took a skyrim to the games library.",1
"made me the pimpmaster i am today. just reaking in to the meth business to fund my apprentice pimps.",1
"a great game that any fan of rpgs will love. if you like medieval fantasy then skyrim is definitely the game for you. once you create a character there is no set class that it has to be, you get to decide what your character is. definitely a must play and if you enjoy it at all you can easily spend a couple hundred hours on this game",1
"over 400 hours on the xbox, and 300 on the pc, i think its safe to say that this has been my most played game in my life. except maybe morrowind....",2
"i prefer fantasy to post-apo... but i prefered playing fallout new-vegas !... nice time playing anyway (with loads of mods to make it beautiful).",1
"owned less than two weeks. 160+ hrs. jeebus, what an addictive game this is...and im enjoying every moment of it. huge fun.",2
"hours of fun, me and my girlfriend have been playing it nonstop.",1
"much has already been said about this game. definitely an essential addition for any es fan. no more creepy zoom in when speaking to someone like in oblivion, skill system is fantastic, and combat is very nice. personally, i like the finishing blow cutscenes, lets you actually get a good look at your character in action. fantastic game when you want to play a big rpg alone.",1
"been out for a while now but i still come back to it! if youre a fan of rpgs and havent played this one yet, pick it up. this game is worth hundreds of hours by itself, and when you add in the massive amount of mods that have been and are being created for this game, skyrim is something you will come back to. definitely worth it the price.",1
"absolutely phenomenal game. wholeheartedly addicting. beware.",1
"this wont let me go on to the game etsporer how do i turn it back on",1
"best game i own (i have 179 on steam...). i would highly recomend it.",1
"any reason for recommending this game should be obvious. massively open world with endless things to do, an enticing story line with a lot of side quests completing the story line should take you about 200 hours if you did it nonstop and new exactly what to do, the leveling system makes it so you get to play your character like you want, ie you can play a powerful mage who wields a dwarven warhammer, the list of reasons to buy this go on for eternity. the only reason you shouldnt buy it is if your computer cant handle it, otherwise youre just lying to yourself and cheating yourself out of an amazing experience.",1
"the long awaited 5th title for the elder scrolls is very much recommended",1
"addictive and easy to find yourself doing just one more dungeon and then realizing you have to work in an hour.",1
"this game is not only beautiful, but has in depth lore, and there is so much to do! <3",2
"been playing this game since it came out and still have not got bored with it. i beat the game on my xbox 360 but then got it for my pc when i realized how big the modding community was. with all of the expansions people have made for it the game seems almost endless.",1
"i started with morrowind, continued with oblivion, now i love this game so much im actually considering playing the up coming online version eso. this game is the best game ive ever had.",2
"if you are a casual gamer, yeah sure. if you are looking for a role playing game, stay the hell away. is a decent adventure game but lacks everything needed to be an rpg.",1
"i think about skyrim at night sometimes, when im alone in my room. 10/10, would bang again.",1
"great game just wish i picked this game up sooner.",1
"enjoyed and burned, recommended if you dont have a real job, you forget your real life and focus on your character, in your dreams too!. damn good experience while lasted!",1
"840.5 hours, i dont think that i lost my sanity at all during this time. if you havent gotten this game get it already, and get the really useful dragons mod. you will never look back. trust me im a doctor with a phd in destruction magic...",3
"not worth the time and the price, repetitive, and it gets boring near the late game, i had to swap my character so i wouldnt be bored but this game is a waste of time and money",1
"one of the things i look for in games is replay value - skyrim is no slouch in that department. the amount of content in this game is incredible - ive been playing this since it first released in 2011 and im still discovering quests and locations ive never found before. a single playthrough can easily log in excess of 100 hours, over 200 in some cases depending on your playstyle. it may not be the perfect game, but the ability to customise it with mods allows the community to shape the game: fix bugs, add new content, overall increasing the lifespan and enjoyment of the game. would i recommend this? any day of the week, without a doubt.",2
"fantastic game, as to be expected from bethesdas elder scroll series. dont take my word on it, play it for yourself. i doubt you will regret it.",1
"honestly, one of the greatest games i have ever played. when the critics first said this was worth over a hundred hours of gameplay, they were not kidding. over 120hrs and im still loving it. theres just so much to do on skyrim its crazy. i approve 15/10.",1
"ambience, 4k texture pack mods, swearing mudcrabs and porn mods everywhere. play on good pcs not  craptops.",1
"some call it skyrim i call it load order simulator: 2015",1
"countless mods. fantasy. open-world adventures. you could honestly sit here, playing this game, and forget about your outside life. what is that anyways?",1
"hands down, my favorite game ever. i kind wish a new elder scrolls was coming out instead of eso :(",1
"crashes all the time  coding laggy movement with the mouse",1
"this has been one of my favorite games of all time, the depth of exploration and the game play have been unmatched by anything else i have played.",1
"bethesda has set a very difficult task to create a grand rpg overshadows all others. and they have done it. so successful games (in this genre) i can not remember. playing it, you can easily forget to indefinite time or forget about time at all. plunging into the cold, harsh world of skyrim scrolls universe, we are offered an impressive and interesting gameplay, adventures, crafts, characters and many original quests. the game is made from the soul deserves praise. skyrim keeps the palm to the release of the witcher 3",1
"my favorite game of all time. 11/10 would genocide wolves again.",1
"buy this game, it is and epic experience within the gaming world.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim, is an adventure game much like the others before it, with its own storyline and content and all that. it is my favorite in the series, one of the main reasons is the steam workshop, you can add whatever you would like from the workshop into your game at any time, you can make the game easier, harder, better, worse, etc. the legend of zelda addons are my favorite of them all. i recomend this game to anyone who doesnt already own it. i give this game a 10/10, a 9001/10 if anyone can can make a doge race mod for it :3",1
"best elder scrolls game ever :3 its hard to make better game than this ;3",1
"personal rating: 9 of 10 one of the best game of the year. great story, awesome graphics fantastic gameplay, tonnes of sub quests and execellent mod community. given there are bugs here and there and that is my only beef with the game but most of the bugs can be resolve in the unofficial mod. if you are a fan of rpg games this is a must have!",2
"this game has to be the best role playing game due to how its modding comunity i was surpirsed how amazing the graphics are even to 2015 thanks to the mods of course and the mods just made it so much better i just going to say thing get the game and you will love it, if u like games with mods get this game",1
"the fifth chapter of the breath-taking fantasy rpg series, the elder scrolls, skyrim is a stunning and exciting journey in the northernmost province of tamriel. set 200 years after the events of the elder scrolls iv: oblivion, the continent is ravaged by war, political descent and the return of the dragons, once thought to have all died long ago. in the midst of these calamities, a hero rises, the dragonborn: a mortal gifted with the soul and power of a dragon, destined to slay the evil dragon alduin, and save nirn from destruction. a game greatly composed of lore, a vast open environment to conquer, quests and storylines to endlessly stumble upon, and a true sense of freedom in the players hand; skyrim could not be more recommended for every open-world fantasy lover. i am proud to call this title, my favorite game ever owned, and even in 2014, it remains one of the best, influential games ever created and played today. 99999999999999/10",2
"okay, you all probably already know this. but skyrim is big, like really big. and awesome. and uh... there are like quests ive heard, but i mostly just chase deer and shoot them.",1
"this is one of may favorite games to play, the mods are fantastic and am looking forward to future mods",1
"the epic atmosphere that wraps this chapter of the tes saga is stunning, allowing the player to dive into a magic world on the edge of a crysis felt never before. the gameplay is quite simplified compared to the previous chapters, nonetheless it still gives a special insight into the fantastic lore of the elder scrolls. 10/10",2
"i would like to recommend this game to all my friends, epic graphics, great story, lots of side quests that will stray you from the main story! :d",1
"i have really enjoyed playing skyrim good grapics and story",1
"this is a fantastic game. so much faster on pc and the controls are a ton easier.",1
"great plot, character and setting. there are so many different things available for the player to do and unending amounts of side missions and mods as well. i would recommend this game to all.",2
"installing 300 mods, lagging like , losing half of summer playng this game. 124123414/10",1
"this game gives you what all games should, complete freedom of what you do, how you do it and the path your game takes",2
"good game. has almost everything. just add more quest and longer fightening in the rebeliion. just some/ few misses i can overlook. thanks bethesda! i could not emagine you could make a game this good after oblivion.",3
"play this game. youve seen the hype. now give in. theres a reason skyrim content still routinely makes the reddit frontpage: tens of thousands of people still play this and think its good. you want example, boy? you can place buckets on peoples heads.",1
"10/10 killed off an entire village, payed gold to get rid of jail time, and took an arrow to the knee.",1
"one of my favorite games to date. you can literally play this game for months and not complete everything. you make make the game completely unique to how you want to play. got a little easy as you became more advanced and crafted higher items, making the fights a little less challenging. however the stories were always interesting and just the fact that i could make the game my own kept me coming. so many little secret areas and things to find. tons of side quests. amazing graphics. completely recommend.",1
"this game though. the best fps fighter ive ever played",1
"this game is so good that i have to write in all caps!!!!!!!!!!!! and use excessive exlimation points!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"so basically what you do in this game is you run around with a really big modded sword (cause thats like the only reason to get it on pc) and slay everything in sight. i.e. dragons, trolls, bandits, forsworn, horses, ice wraiths, spiders, dogs, friends, family, sometimes yourself, ghosts, some more dragons (cause thats the point to this game), guards, vampires, wearwolves, etc. basically everything except children cause thats wrong and you should feel bad for trying. 10/10 would recommend always.",1
"all the other reviews practically said it all. this game is totally breathtaking. it is an epic adventure indeed. from slaying giant spiders out of boredom to questing on hunting dragons to beat the story, this game has it all. you can spend all the nights in the world just playing skyrim and after that you still wont be able to say i beat this game. the world of skyrim is truly amazing. hundreds of quests that can be picked up from anything! from talking to npcs, reading a book, eavsdropping on a conversation, or even killing a poor innocent man and searching his body for any notes or clues. certainly this is one of my favorite games. the landscape is so vast and filled with lore. if you like exploration and questing, then this is the game for you! 3 years after the release of this game and i still didnt get bored. this is definitely a must get game.",1
"i enjoyed this game more than most games that i have played, strongly recommend.",3
"morrowind>shivering isles>oblivion>skyrim. what can i say i prefer the classics.",1
"one of the best sandbox games ever played free roam rpg what ever best game (:",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim (2011) was released nearly three years ago, and almost everything that can be said about it has been said. the massive open world, the army of side quests and the epic dlc have all been talked about to death. so what do i say? its a good game and i heavily recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the fantasy/rpg genre.",1
"nowadays, theres no reason not to get this game. a playthrough will last you for about 100 hours, which is really good considering its a 15 game (and getting it for -75% is rather easy if youre patient). skyrim is a good game. i wouldnt say its great due to its mediocre combat, mediocre physics and lack of feeling of progression at times. but its enjoyable nonetheless. i feel like the games overrated, but its certainly not bad.",1
"this game starts out all well and good. it looks decent, the soundtrack is nice, and the intro quest is exciting (the first time). after about 4 hours i started to really notice how shallow it was though. every quest seemed to involve going into a cave to kill bandits/zombies and retrieve item x to give to person y. you can be good at everything in the world with one character, from the worlds deadliest assassin to the leader of a group of werewolf warriors to the archmage of a college of magic. the combat never strays far from clicking rapidly until your health runs low, downing a few potions, repeat. harder difficulties only make combat take longer, it doesnt actually make it harder.that being said there is quite an extensive mod community and everything thats wrong with the game has been fixed and everything you could ever imagine can be added to your game. tl;dr: is it fun? yes (with mods)",1
"shouted a goat off a mountain, then talked about a book with a dragon. 11/10",1
"nice game. the game itself is fun and the options open world its excellence. great graphics and an interesting story. minus the it requires a lot of thinking. and a lot of patience. that the task requires a mindset such as deciphering codes and passwords and other ... but all lovers of the mmo must purchase the game.",1
"keeps you occupied for hours and hours on end. beautifully designed, too.",1
"i might not have alot of gametime but this games is soo cool 9/10 if you like dayz you will like skyrim :d #killingchickensfordays",1
"all of oblivions flaws were perfected in the elder scrolls v: skyrim. the magic system is much more appealing than it was in oblivion and the various approaches to a battle are more balanced than ever. the music is incredible to say the least and the graphics are mind-blowing. bethesda also improved their reputation by removing the technical issues that are normally sprinkled in their games. this is an easy recommendation to any gamer out there looking for an awesome game. gameplay: 19/20 ... awesome (the bugs with the dragons and the quantity over quality concept is annoying) story: 8/10 ... great graphics: 5/5 ... perfect sound/music: 5/5 ... flawless (so epic...) controls 5/5 ... perfect overall: 93% (42/45) ... awesome",2
"one of the legendary games i have played in my life",1
"doesnt live up to the older titles. ok action game pretty bad in the rpg department.",1
"this game is highly recommended by me and many others because of its open world rpg fantasy game. it consists of a huge map, full of dungeons, places and quests to find and do, and has many creatures to fight. as dragonborn, i find the game gives you very op powers. but thats alright, i like it when games do that.",2
"probably the best game ive ever played in my life. i have owned it on 360 and pc, and i think this game drank from the pudle of life because, with mods it never dies. every new start is a new adventure, and yeah i had to comment. this game is well game god.",1
"go skyrim !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"play dis cuz its fun and i like it and i think its fun a likable and full of fun and likeness",1
"a must have with incredible content, great community (dozens of mods) and very nice feeling. only some minor bugs preventing to give it 10/10. anyway, one the the best games in last decade...",1
"one of the best gamer. wasted many an hour on this",1
"where to start, this game has everything you could ever want from an open world rpg.",1
"graphics are phenominal, the replay value is intangible, and the story and quest progression is exostential. i have no clue what those words mean but it sounds good.",1
"why are you even reading this recommendation? stop wasting time and just buy this game already!",1
"sure, it looks amazing but its really just 150+ hours of point and click repetition with few highlights and no story worth a damn. if youve got a job or a family or a life, dont waste your precious free time on this treadmill.",1
"great game for anyone who loves rpg and action games, for anyone who likes killing monsters and dragons and for anyone who knows to appreciate a good story. the graphics are great, tho there are alot of glitches with it (which somtimes makes the game more funny). the only 2 problems i have with the game are- 1) the menu in-game is built for consoles- but it doesnt really matter. 2)once you start playing the story you cant stop-not because the game doesnt allow you to, because its too damm addicting! (be warned)",1
"the best game i have played in 30 years of playing games.",2
"skyrim is a massivly fun and expansive game full of rich lore and emeorable characters. the coabt and spell system is awesome to control. the game has a huge universe to explore with deep and exicting quests. quotable charcters and really cool looking weapons ans armours. the game looks beautiful and has tiny little details that make the game even more fun. one of the best rpgs i have played. can be a little glitchy and buggy from time to time but i love any game created by bethesda!",1
"possibly one of my very favorite games of all time. i have owned two copies of this game now- and even on bottom graphics settings and 20fps i managed 800+ hours in the space of just a few months without even realizing. it has fantastic graphics, huge scale, great gameplay, fun quests, a dynamic and utterly brilliant world and so many side quests your face will implode. 9.5/10",1
"100+ hours later, mods and mods installed, and i still love this game.",1
"quite simply the greatest game ive ever played in my life. a pure masterpiece. 9/10 vanilla 10/10 modded.",4
"take a look at my play time. that should give you an indicator of how i feel about this game. then, factor in that i havent even completed the main quest yet... the base game is pretty awesome, but the community mods here on steam workshop and on nexus are what really make this game amazing!",2
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best open world rpg games ive ever played. endless hours of fun and exploring to do. continous amounts of quests to complete and a range of skills to pick for your character. this game will always be a 10 out of 10 for me.",2
"this game has so much too do! you can easily log in more than 200 hours into this game!",1
"quite enjoyable.... many things to do, places to explore, and creatures to do battle with!",2
"if you didnt already think this game was like crack (read: addicting) then just wait until you start browsing the community workshop for user-created content and mods. it really improves the replayability whether you stay lore-friendly and just expand on the universe or go off into silly tangents or overpowered hilarity.",2
"im a white male, but i played the game once as a black female. two thumbs up.",1
"yo there are mods for this game where you can  hot babes a++++++ must buy",1
"puting mods on this game make it even awesomer to play.",1
"grate game. especialy with all the mods yoo kan get to it.",2
"i still play this game a lot, then i took an arrow to the knee.....",1
"goty 2011 and one of the best rpg(game) ive ever played. must have/buy game.",1
"a great addition to the elder scrolls series. the game itself is great but the modding community makes it amazing! it has so much content that i have yet to finish the game. i keep getting distracted with all of the side quests and mods. it is a game that you can play straight through and miss a ton of content. on the flip side you can work on side quests and mods and just never get around to finishing the game. it has it quarks like all the elder scrolls games but usually they are funny and just add to the charm of the game.",3
"the best game i ever played in my life, perfect atmosphere, perfect combat, history more than perfect, amazing characters. if on sale buy it. if it isnt on sale buy it. ull never get tired of playing this amazing game.",2
"i can ride thomas the tank engine mod it until it crashes/10",1
"amazing i play it in all my free time just amazing",1
"first of all, i wanted to say that when i first bought it, i didnt play it for about 2 weeks (i had it installed and all), but then one day i thought, well what the hell ill give it a try, at first i thought well this might get booring because i pretty much know the storyline because ive seen multiple walkthroughs (mainly seamus o doherty - ssoh) and playing for about 3 hours it started getting really addictive, for the first week that i played i already had about 60 hours of gameplay, im not even half way through, 100hours of gameplay and im still trying not to get too carried away as i usually spend 5 hours playing in a row if i decide to play it at all. all in all, its really addictive, it looks real good, works well even on low-end desktops (maybe not at all on low-end laptops) and gameplay is actually pretty good, it does get quite repetetive, but its enjoyable.",1
"i mean, its skyrim. of course i recommend it! who wouldnt??",1
"all i can say is: 195 hours played and still not bored. 195 hours. do the math. this has kept me engrossed for the most of 8 complete days. just a perfect game. the only les are just perfunctory (usual strange clipping issues, occasionally a companion will block a door which can be easily solved by backing away, sneaking does not fully work with a companion who can resurrect). but those are les olny noticed after 195 hours. just gaming perfection this thing.",1
"played through this twice now, amazing game, great visuals, virtually unlimited replayability. 10/10",1
"an amazing role-playing experience with a beautiful setting and tons of memorable moments. there are already hundreds of hours of gameplay in the game and if you get bored of that just remember why mods were invented...",1
"accidentally hit a chicken and the whole town rose to kill me. 11/10",1
"true gamers know the value brought to the table by bethesda.",3
"im used to playing mmorpgs and sandbox indie games but never anything like skyrim, i was afraid id get bored so fast becouse of the single player thing as im used to online games but im hooked!",1
"good game, but needs a good amount of modding to be great to the level of morrowind. 4 of 5. (the ease of modding is a plus) only flaw is that its a bugthesda game, with bugs present even now.",1
"this is by far one of the best games ive ever played!",1
"with 300 hours played in this game, i can safely say that there is a near-unending amount of content. bethesda made another great game, with stunning and original story lines, and if you do manage to make it through their main content, and the numerous dlcs, there are thousands of side quests that require you to explore a huge and fantastically made world, with every rock and mountain designed thoughtfully, and hundreds of mods and player built dlc, bethesda has crafted a stunning new chapter to their amazing elder scrolls series",2
"can be like colonel mustang (for those who know him). read the argonian maid 11/10.",1
"words cant describe what i have experience in this game honestly like where do i start! 1. mods 2. more mods 3.s of skyrim (must have for immerson) but seriously this game is amazing i remember playing it for the first time on xbox back in late 2011 and now playing it on pc with hundreds of mods! and even though the story is a bit dull compared to oblivion and morrwinds stories and is the basic overused your the chosen one it is still amazing and ive played through it 5 times on different platforms. anyway i recommend this to anyone that enjoys games where you can do what ever the  you want or for people who wanted a challange because you can really change the whole game with mods anyway i keep going off subject besides all the awesome things in this game i will admit that the dragon fights are very very easy and the same repetitive hit them when they get on the ground and asorb there soul crap but thats nothing a couple mods cant fix anyway buy this game just do it!",1
"the elder scrolls 5 skyrim is in my opinion one of the greatest fantasy game i have ever played, the elder scrolls series just keeps getting better. the best thing about this game is the amount of freedom and choices you get in the game. you could play as a barbaric warrior or a badass mage. you can be every class you would expect from a fantasy game. it has a brilliant main questline and side quests what draw you in.",1
"its game of the year, and with good reason. it has infinite playability and replayability. a must get game.",3
"i definitely recommend the game to anyone interested. this is undoubtedly one of the best...no, the best game i have ever played. never before had i been so excited everytime i played it. ironically, when the game was initially released i disliked it due to the fact the i had to kill dragons, (i had a soft spot for them) now, 3 years down the road, im gonna maul some bandits with odahviing! :) bethesda, you did too good on this one, now start working on tes 6! :d",1
"a godlike and peniultimate rpg, skyrim. with a story of dragons returning, making dragon age seem like a total piece crap! 10/10 this game is more than a steal at 20 dollas",1
"run around barely clothed. kill everything with your fists. shoot everything with  arrows.",1
"extremely fun. i have played fallout 3 and fallout: new vegas, which were also bethesda games (excuse me if i say it right). i wasnt real into rpg like games, but i gave it a try. great visuals, especially with some graphics enchancers for it. 10/10",1
"this game is hella fun. it would take years for you to get bored of this game. want to fight thomas the tank engine? theres a mode for that! want to have a pet dragon? theres a mod for that! theres a mod for basically anything you could want to make skyrim your very own game.",1
"best game ever no matter how times you play it makes you come back for another play through.",1
"so engaging... so awesome. i rarely replay games, skyrim is the exception. it is so much fun, the textures and art are top-notch, and the music is phenomenal.",1
"i dont know about everyone else, but i just love killing all my enemies and then sitting in their chairs to see what they did in their leisure time.",1
"one of the best single player games out there : ) if you are new you level skills in game by using the items that match get hit with light armor on... your light armor skills go up ect ect wander and have some fun ;) if you are unsure of keys just pull up the main menu and look at key bidings in settings",1
"any fan of the action/adventure genre will have loads of fun with this game.",1
"this game is probably one of the best moddable game i have ever played. there are so many, many things you can do and you can be anything you want to be on skyrim. it has almost never-ending quests and a big place to exploring around. this game is for the true adventure lovers. i would totally recommend you to buy this game! 2 thumb up! skyrim 4 life!",1
"skyrim, and oblivion before it, set a high standard for rpg. non-linear = stuck on a quest? ill ignore that one for now. modding = add quests, superweapons, difficulty, races, areas, more. radiant quests = game creates new quests, game never ends. my hero has everything, killed everyone? keep the old hero, and start different kind of character. cant find the mod you like? i did not have to be a pro to do small mods on my own. there are puzzles. but no pixel-hunting. the dlc is good. but truly optional.",2
"crazy addictive. bethesda really makes an effort to give their games depth, and suceed beyond expectation with this.",1
"i found out how to use the developer console. instant knife kills/10 i found out how mods work sanic/10",1
"if you dont have this game. you porobibly have a girlfriend or somthing. yuck",1
"this game makes every other game ive played seem tasteless.",1
"ok so heres the deal. i own all dlcs for this game and clearly am in love with it. what is especially awesome is the mods the nexus community provides. dont use steams workshop, ive struggled with it for way too long before abandoning. the nexus mod manager can make this process way more seamless than valves take on it. when you learn the tools - you can create an awesome experience of your own. lets commend bethesda for making elder series games, but mods and their authors take this truly magnificent sanbox and improve the experience, stability and replayability of skyrim many times over. enjoy this epic experience you magnificent s.",2
"i think this game is still one of the best rpg in the store. this is must-have for rpg fans. lots of deep stories, large map, swords and dragons... anything else needed? nope!",1
"i have come to the conclusion that this game is freakn dope",1
"fantastic, just like the rest of the elder scrolls games!",1
"best game ever!!! 278 hours in this is simply what gaming is about so much to do and try. the elder scrolls has always been a good long series but skyrim steps it up to a new level. if you play pc games you cannot miss this one! plain and simple.",2
"hello! i decided to make a guide, how fast to pump level. at the very beginning of the game you go into krepost (with ralofom or imperial dude). kill enemies, take the key, but do not open the door! your assistant (ralof or imperial dude) arise near the door. you yuzaete stealth and beat with a dagger, sword or ax. raise your level very quickly. check, put your finger on top. thank you all. if you want to swing to a legendary)))",2
"i nearly got executed, went to prison, became a werewolf, saved the world three times, built a mansion, and read a book. 10/10 would play again.",1
"legendy edition (with all the dlc) is (overall) the best fantasy rpg of all time, and i _love_ fantasy rpgs. the dlc really adds a lot of high-quality content. best played when you have all of the content at the beginning and the whole world just melts together with the dlc and you dont really know what is coming from where.",1
"most amazing game with so much playabilty, 3 years old and still amazing graphics and constant mods produced by the community!",1
"mod support? enb graphic mods? massive expansive world? 1000 hours of playtime and still not finished? 9/10 shlongs of skyrim?! 11/10 goty",1
"cmon, this is even better than oblivion, if you liked that. not just a hype, its a real legend of a game. but then again i love every rpg game ever...",1
"that one game that 25% of people play for pure fun, and the rest just play it for the sex mods and nude models. 10/10",1
"this is a review you can trust, do not listen to any other review besides this. as you can probably see, i have played this game for 275+ hours, and i still have not done everthing there is to do in the game, not including mods. the game is full of rich content that still blows me away. yes, the graphics may be a little outdated but the game is from 2011. if you are wondering if you should buy this game, do it. the game is almost endless, and if you do get bored of the game once in a great while, then just download a mod and it will make the game exciting again. if i were to rate this game i would have to rate it a 9.4 out of 10. this is not a 10 out of 10 because of the bugs and glitches, sometimes you have no idea what to do next, the graphics are a bit outdated, and when you beat the game you can get a bit bored (until you download mods).",2
"id spend a lifetime on this game and still discover new things 10/10",1
"a beautiful game! its definitely a must for your rpg-collection. its universe is so dynamic and living!",1
"really good game, pity that the multiplayer version is going to cost so much",1
"guys, this is the game that never ends. this game is for the casual gamer, and for the most hard core.",1
"one of my all time favorite games. a great mix of first person combat and fantasy.",1
"skyrim is hands down the best game ive ever played! great graphics and good storyline. for those who like a bit of free-play, this is also perfect since the world is endless, and you dont necessarily have to do the quests. i also found the workshop to be very interesting. the only con with the game is that there are some annoying bugs, but they will probably be fixed in the future. warning, this game is strongly addictive!",1
"not much more can be said than has been said already. there are few games that i feel suck you into its world compeltely, and leave you yearning to return. skyrim is the one that tops them all. with constant community mods that enhance the game without breaking it, this is very well deserving for the goty it recieved.",3
"by order of the jarl of steamrun i demand you play this game.",1
"after over 120 hours of play over 3 different consoles i still havent discovered half of the content within this title; not to mention not touching a single expansion pack yet. this game is simply the finest example of an open world rpg. it never feels padded or empty due to the sprawling vibrant world whilst the combat, admittedly simplistic, gives enough variety and progression to keep you playing long into the night.",1
"very nice game. although be warned, too many mods and the game has a seizure",1
"fus ro dahin everything, eating tons of cheese and cabbage mid-fight to prevent death. 11/10 would bang",1
"gameplay 10/10 graphics 10/10 music 10/10 dragons 9/10* *dragons lost a point because theyre not really dragons, theyre wyverns.",1
"i use to write game recommendations like you, untill i took an arrow to the knee.",1
"this is game is probably the best rpg to hit us in the last decade and i have played it on all three platforms. first being of course my 360. but nothing compares to how beautiful this game looks on a pc, mainly a desktop being much more powerful than a laptop. anyways, if youre part of the 1% that hasnt played this game yet you really need to. youre missing out.",1
"good game, open world, little glitches, not shity combat, makes me happy.",1
"one of the best games ive ever played to this day, so much to do. no need to do the main story quest. you can just have your own home and make a living from hunting while finding a few treasures and random events on the way.",1
"skyrim is an awesome and exciting game and everyone should play it ^.^",1
"this has been my favorite game since 2011 ive had it for 3 years and im still playing",3
"this game is great if you love le arrow to le knee me-me",1
"those that havent played an elder scrolls game really needs to get with the picture. huge world, hundreds of quests. npcs with a schedule and a life, epic dragon warfare. this game is also part of steamworks so its fully moddable in a few easy clicks. fos ro dah",2
"this game is amazingly open and fun. it has managed to absorb my time in a way that i had definitely not expected. i ended pushing toward the end primarily to reduce my own need to play the game so i could play others. i really look forward to more content being released for it.",1
"doesnt matter how leveled you get, how many skills you legendary how many perks you learn, how many quests you take, how many daggers you smith, how many swords you enchant, how many potions you brew, how many spells you learn, how many scrolls you use, how many guilds you join, how many dragons you slay, how many barrows you loot, how many skeletons you explode, how many locks you pick, how many daedra you meet, how many daedric artifacts you collect, how many bunnies you wabbajack, how many cheese wheels you steal, how many jarls make you thane, how many houses you buy, how many followers you recruit, how many atronachs you summon, how many shouts you learn, how many times you jump off of high hrothgar, how many civil wars you win, how many times you kill alduin. orcs still call you a milkdrinker.",3
"its great, really one of the best games, awesome plot and quests, and even on low graphics it is still much better quality then most other games ive played. i highly recommend this, modding it was a lot of fun too. 5 stars.",1
"its a great experience to play. ... realistically. beautiful landscapes, immersive music. in my opinion the best game to try if you like the saga or if you are a follower of game with this genre. skyrim in two words simplement magnifique. *** update : as i can see if you keep playing the game hours and hours you would never get bored, plus you can find a lot of great mods at the workshop to . i keep telling to myself that i should get more free time in my life to immerse myself completely into skyrim (*o*)",1
"skyrim is the 5th installment in the elder scrolls games. the visuals are beautiful, and the story thus far is good. though the combat in skyrim is more versatile than oblivions combat, in the beginning i feel oblivions combat is still smoother but you get used to the change. the new crafting options are a nice add to the game. be wary though that every bethesda game is bound to have a lot of bugs on release. so if you buy the game, dont be discouraged about bugs, they will be fixed. i enjoy this game.",1
"great storyline, fantastic quests, some hilarious dialogue, fine mechanics, charming npcs, brilliant companions and to top it off, theres mods.",2
"i love this game i cant for the elder scrolls online come out in april 2014!!!!",1
"how can one not recommend skyrim? expansive, beautiful, and a sense of epic grandeur befitting the elder scrolls name. buy it, play it, love it.",1
"i rode a horse to the top of a mountain, jumped off, tried to say thanks, and it flew away... 11/10 for having pegasus",1
"such a great game! you can lose yourself for hours, especially if you mod it. its quite immersive, so much so i found myself standing by a river with ice and actually decided to take the long way around cause it would be freezing if i went in.",1
"skyrim itself is a pretty  game. but with nude mods and the ability to create your own harem with the creation kit, this is one of the best hentai games on the market.",2
"this could be the funnest game i ever played. only one thing i need to say is mod it untill it crashes xd",2
"a phenomonal game, few role-playing games can include such an enormous amount of content and have the player at no stage find it dull or repetitive. the immense size of skyrim is a testimant to the outstanding skill and talent bethesda has to offer. the visuals are excellent, the audio sets the right mood for any coming adventure and the unscripted soundtrack leaves shivers up ones spine. the gameplay is familiar but refreshing and the quests are immersive and interesting. bethesda has produced a role-playing game that leaves other developers shaking there heads in disbelief. this is another superb game in a catalog of an already numberous number of superb rpgs.",1
"skyrim is with no doubt one of the best games recently released. an open-world rpg with an infinite amount of quests and modding support ? count me in.",4
"this game is so fun especially with mods to make it even better, its a must play!",1
"meh. for me its really slow. well by slow i meen, 8,000 dragons trying to  you all at once. its a horrible game.",1
"so fun! i probably spent around an entire month on this game! so much to do and never gets borin!",1
"best mmo i have played yet cant wait for the next!",1
"awsome game can put hour on hour and still love it",1
"if most games are walks through an amusement park, skyrim was a debaucherous romp through a museum. all time favorite game.",1
"everything about this game screams quality and adventure. while bethesda hasnt exactly got a track record for delivering bug-free games at launch, this has been a pleasant, polished and amazing experience so far. a much improved third-person view, amazing music, a living breathing world, a menu-system thats amazing and a game filled with interesting stuff to do. truly a masterpiece.",3
"even without mods features a beautiful world. decent performance, although indeed its not the best pc port. basically its fallout with swords, dragons and magic!",1
"this game is as addictive as meth but wastes more hours than the high does. 11/10",2
"i was told this game was brilliant. i loved morrowind and despite my better judgement bought this game in the hopes theyd not made the same mistakes they made on oblivion. unfortunately its buggy, the user interface is absolutely dire, the map design is unhelpful, the inventory management is a constant thorn in your side and its clearly a console port. theres simply no excuse for a game designed on a pc to have a console friendly ui thats unhelpful for pc users. also you shouldnt have to pause mid-combat to simply change spells. i realise consoles are very limited because of their sub-standard hardware and lack of control systems but pc are not and a game ported across should reflect that. i tried using mods to see if it was fixable but gave up as that was overly complicated and i couldnt find the mods that would turn this into a proper pc game. if i recommend you try this game then you can safely assume that you are not a friend of mine.",1
"well i can tell you so much things about that game but i wont :d. this is the best game i saw, i think if you like the game and know it you will enjoy to listen this....",1
"i really recommend this game. it is very cool because you can add so many mods to change the game to the way you like. you can check skyrimnexus or check the steam workshop. i dont think ive played it vanilla yet cuz i like to modify games :)",1
"i just cant get enough of this game, im always want some more. and you know what? this game actually can offer you some more: -a lot of quests and ways to solve them; -beatiful locations to explore; -random game events between npcs and monsters which is interesting to watch (group of guards vs badss dragon, wolves pack attacking an npc, etc); -huge amount of mods, most of them just make grass greener, armor shinier, boobs bigger and turn horses into mlp characters, but there is some mods that can comletely change the whole game. you still not satisfied? theres 3 dlc with dragon riding, another dragonborn, new shouts, vampires, wolverines, crossbows, dirty orphans which can be adopt, your own house which you can buy or build, and also marriage (not a greatest decision in your life, but still) waiting for you. and achievement hunting, of course! trully 10/10",1
"well what to say about this game that hasnt been said a million times? i still love it after 3 years and making all achievments on 3 platforms. any one thinking of trying this at the new low prices should just do it. massive world, 100 hours of game play with side quests, immersive cahracters and areas. the ease of using a xbox360 controller for input on the computer was just the perfect bonus. 9.5 outta 10 personal stars :)",1
"probably one of the greatest rpg games you will play. get it because of this and also because workshop and nexus",1
"a tale of epic proportions matched only by its predecossors. skyrim is a game of grapic quality and clarity that really makes you feel that you are in the world of the elder scrolls. its vastly improved combat and engaging chat options combined with its detailed characters and astonishing beasts allow you to delve into a world of endless possiblities. it is a game that transcends into reality through its detail and delivers perfection on what it promises.",1
"now ive played the previous oblivion only! and i enjoyed that game alot with the mods and story board, the engine and graphics were decent....as were my computer specs so i couldnt complain! point was it was playable on any machine and it was fun! wait for this game to come out i have played it on ps3 and now steam. it is one of the best offline rpgs i ahve ever played... althought i still dont get the buzz i get when i played oblivion... skyrim offers top graphics and if your not satisfied with that.... you have mods to boost up the graphics! the story board is creative and amazing. the engine is much better than the oblivion engine however it still have the stealing weird thing where if u steal something some guard who never saw you would come to you and ask you to go to prison. apart from all that i would give it a 9/10 as it is unique...almost niche in its way of entertaining the player and still has that essence of elder scrolls!",1
"i cant even count how many hours i spent on just vanilla one on my xbox and then i made the greatest decision to buy it on steam like i should have in the first place and with mods it is all completely new again. and the dlc adds a lot of content. 10/10 would ruin social life again",2
"with skyrim, bethesda manages to include nearly every favorite feature from previous games in the series while adding a mind numbing amount of new content. i hit level 81 at 100 hours and im still excited to explore the rest of the 200 hours worth.",1
"not much to review at this point. its a classic. amazing open world rpg but whats more is the mods. the mods have made this into a mainstay, ever evolving masterpiece. if you dont own this on pc, you should.",1
"yes i would recommed skyrim to others and i really like play skyrim",1
"so, what do we say about  the elder scrolls v: skyrim . no words to describe it, buy it, play it, beat it, mod it, play again, lose your social life, repeat everyday. - rules of skyrim 2014",1
"its pretty and the fighting is streamlined compared to other tes games so as a stand-alone open world action-rpg, its fun. but it is definitely the worst elder scrolls game. skyrim takes a wood chipper to the delicately crafted lore of the series and then lays about five or six internet memes at its grave. you fight the same damn enemy for about 4/5s of the game, the leveling system and ui is so over-kill simplistic that it actually makes it harder to work, the shouts are hilariously stupid and feel like a bad mod, the music is unfitting and comes out of nowhere so randomly that it kills any mood. the main quest is absolutely terrible and bounces between characters that are either overly dramatic or completely uninterested in the games biggest focus, dragons. it basically has the presentation consistency of an elementary school play. if previous elder scrolls games try to humble you with the scale of the setting, skyrim tries to jack you off. and a little too fast to be enjoyable. if youre a fan of the series, im sorry. if youre from reddit, have fun.",1
"my favourite game in whole world!! absolutely amazing! however if you do choose to use mods within the game, do be careful since it may affect gameplay and setting may have to be ruduce to maintain a sufficient fps. otherwise absolutely brilliant!",2
"if youre a fan of the previous elderscrolls games, or anything rpg medieval related, this is the game for you. i could put countless hours upon hours looting various dungeons and crypts. definitely recommend it!",1
"there is no excuse for you to not have played this game.",1
"one of those games that silently creeps behind you, and before you even know it, youve been caught and will never be able to escape from it. tes v: skyrim is the game ive played the most, and even after all this time i return to its cold, lonely fjords.",1
"honestly one of the best elder scroll games i have ever played. i own it on all of my consoles (dont ask me how that happened) but i completed every quest on the game including the dlc on my xbox and now in the midst of doing that on pc for badges/achievements. and if you think its fun but want more just mod the hell out of it!!",1
"fun for a while, then it gets really boring. kinda wish i had morrowind or oblivion instead. now im just playing it to see if i can get to level 100. regardless, it looks beautiful and plays like a dream. i give it 9 ranting priests in whiterun out of 10.",1
"a lot of bugs, apart from that, fantastic lore and great game ! a must have.",1
"put 243 hours in and dawnguard broke everything during beyond death. waste of time, waste of money, this game got me so excited to play and it just gets cut short due to bugs that no solution or recommendation could fix and the game does not progress.",2
"epic fantasy with a good plot. stunningly beautiful scenery and detailed villages and people. countless side quests. this is skyrim. id say its one of the best games ive played in years. those dragons are really tough, though. its not one of those games where you kill all the ememies without dying once. overall, its well worth getting.",1
"well, folks ive put many hours into this game the weekend of release and i must say overall this is an absolutely fantastic single player rpg. bethesda has honed the open world rpg to a fine art, giving you a world and a basic set of directions and letting you have at it. if you played any of the previous games you will love it of course, and find it a step forward in immersion. new players will not be lost at all as this game tells its own story. im not thrilled about the console centric ui (which will probably be patched), control customization issues, and lack of general pc optimization... but these are not deal killers at all and will be fixed either by bethesda or the modding community in time... which is another great thing: the game will continue to live on through dlc and modders for many years to come... the best entertainment value ever.",2
"played +300 hours on console and just got it on pc! this game is unbelivably good, there are hundreds hours of enjoyment in this game and with mods houndreds more! this game is by far my favrouite game. recommend it 100%",1
"great game, definitely a must have for anyones library.",1
"not much to say about skyrim. its like any other elder scrolls game in the series, except for the fact that skyrim is rather simplified. i do suggest picking it up though mainly because of the mods that are simply outstanding, allowing you to craft a good game into something unimaginably spectacular.",1
"while i am a huge fan of the elder scrolls series, the pc version of skyrim for me is still having the green water bug and i can only fix it with a mod enabled which is quite irritating. barring that one problem, it is a wonderful addition to the series.",1
"abandon all hope ye who enter. while this may appear to be a simple game about killing dragons, it is actually the programming embodiment of cthulhu... it will ensnare you with the tentacles of exploration and crafting, and pull you in deeper and deeper to the detriment of your life. soon you will be spending thousands of dollars on new computer equipment in an attempt to have more realistic water. this is due to the dark horrifying truth... once you start, this becomes your life, and everything else is merely a gut-wrenching distration designed to keep you away from the real world. if you have any hope of living a real life, getting married, having kids, etc; for the love of all that is good, turn back now, and leave this door shut...",4
"the gametime does not account for the hundreds of hours played on my xbox. 10/10 took an arrow to my social life.",1
"walking around in a vast open heroic fantasy world as a strong warrior, a battlemage or a sneaky rogue, fighting dragons and other monsters. nuff said. and to complete that, so many mods made by fans...",1
"in late 2011 i read an artical in the magazine game informer about a new rpg coming out called the elder scrolls v: skyrim. i was unfamiliar with the series exept for a few faint memories of friends recomending it (oblivion). i was quite a fanboy (and still am) of bethesda, and so i went out, gathered $30.00, and stopped by gamestop and bought the goty edition, just to try out the series. i was so fulfilled with the series, i literally put aside 50 hours freetime for skyrim. i was so happy with skyrim i got an x-box live, just to get dawngaurd early. definately recomended! you just got recomended!",1
"its pretty old but very good, bethesda knows what their doing.",2
"this game is endless fun!... untill it ends anyway... great game if you dont have it your missing out.",1
"the province of skyrim might be frigid, but the role-playing game that takes place within it burns with a fire few games possess. you take up arms against dragons, and your encounters with them are invariably exciting - yet depending on where your adventure takes you, such battles may not even represent the pinnacle of your experience. side quests that starts as a momentary distraction may turn into a full-fledged tale that could form the entirety of a less ambitious game. i had very hight hopes before release, and i was right to, a definate must - an absoloute bargain on steam right now, get this in your library. 10/10",1
"even with all the anticipation and extremely high expectations, bethesda delivers yet another impressive addition to the elder scrolls line.",1
"this game has unlimited potential! whether it be dlc or workshop addons, this game has allways come out on top!",2
"game revolves around oh  dragons!. the dragons arent dragons, theyre wyverns.",1
"god, yes. although combat gets a bit stale after sinking in over 500 hours (dont judge me), the world is so massive and detailed itll keep you entertained for months. recommended!!!",2
"there is so much amazing about this game. it is so well thought out in pretty much every aspect. after you spend the first half hour or so customizing your character, you are pushed right in to the world of skyrim. with the newly released free hd texture pack dlc, the world looks better than it ever has before. if youve already completed all the missions, there are hundreds of mods you can install that can change the game just a little bit, or add large amounts of new content. this game is on sale pretty frequently, so it is definitely something you should pick up, as it has countless hours of playability.",1
"amazing, so many hours of great fun. great storylines, multitudes of quests, one of those games you will never complete.",1
"there are good games.. and there are great games skyrim is the best game.",1
"just who could dislike this artwork?make the simple and easy tutorial,then go and do whatever u want!go and rob all the houses!or try to get to solitude on foot,until u get killed!or make some quests evolve and then destroy everything! 60/10 ive bought it twice just to have on pc. seeing winterheld burn......defending whiterune......it got great graphics and dont require a rly good system,but a normal one though to can have high,the story and gameplay is just epic.how the heck a khjait became an archmage,legate,companion and thane xd short:as its on sale,buy it.",1
"i love this game. i have played it since it came out, and i still play it. you become an addict to it, and discover new things everyday in it. if you ever get done with the game (not very likely) you can just install mods and get tons of more gameplay. i cant see anything bad in this game",1
"who doesnt love the elder scrolls games? amazing open world rpg to throw hours of your life at.",2
"very nice graphics, very immersive environment and story. mods allow to extend the playtime atleast tenfold. buy dis",1
"this game is the holy grail of all open world rpgs. it plays fantastic on pc and has a fantastic replay value. this is one of my personal favourite video games of all time and isnt far off top spot. soundtrack is fantastic and adds to the already evident nordic feel. not quite as stat based or strategic as oblivion or morrowind before it, and has its own charm separate from the other elder scrolls games. a masterpiece. 9.5/10",1
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",1
"very nice game. still the best rpg out there. and one big plus point its moddable ! 9.5/10",1
"this game is epic, with so many things to do, it almost never gets boring, and with the option of mods, you can make yhe game even more epic, and even longr, totally waorth $20.00",1
"its the elder scrolls...what else do you need to know? its vast, epic, and fun. there are bugs, but if youve ever played a bethesda game, you probably already knew that. one time i stumbled across a group of giants who then took it upon themselves to start the skyrim space program by attempting to put me in orbit. i managed to take them both out with only 10% of my health remaining. and as i stood there, victorious, i looked up just as a dragon decided to drop in.",1
"love it a lot! sniping people with your bow, feeling badass and a lot to do! explore the world of skyrim, are you an imperial, or a stormcloak?",1
"skyrim is alot of things, but one thing you will never find your self liking it to is boring, this game replay value alone to tremendous, throw in the enemies, bosses and fights and you will never turn away.",1
"once all the hype died down and i started replaying skyrim i noticed a lot of flaws with the game that werent apparent to me when i initially played it. while the gameplay of skyrim is a necessary improvement over oblivion and fallout it just lacks a lot of depth that even oblivion had. the lack of classes really makes every character you play as feel similar, and the lack of restrictions or stats means you can play a thief in heavy armor and justify it by the game just not caring. indeed the questlines are interesting the first time around but the lack of the ability to fail them or indeed decide an alternate route makes them really tedious the second or third time. it makes them feel very shallow, and it doesnt help theres only maybe 7 of them before you are automatically promoted to the head of the specific guild you joined. the games pretty great the first time you play it but i really dont look upon skyrim as well as i used to. the shallow content really rings true once youve tried replaying the game and the interesting dungeon aesthetic only points out how you go in a straight line in all of them.",2
"skyrim, an open world game seqel to the elder scrolls oblivion, is an amazing open world story about dragons, shouts and fantasy. this is truly an epic game, and if you do not have it i reccomend you pick it up immediatly!",1
"no matter what the mood your in you can allways play the amazing game of skyrim",1
"skyrim is probably the best open world rpg i have ever played. you should buy it. modding it can add hundreds of hours of playtime, with probably 50 hours of gameplay by itself, with just one playthrough. although it is kinda buggy...",3
"when this game first came ou in 2011, i got it on console & hated it! my taste in video games has changed a bit, so i thought since its on sale for $4.99 ill give it ago. i just bought it & ive played for about 4 hours. i just got sucked in, lol. its still not quite my type of game, but i enjoy learning & being open minded, so i shall just continue to play & kill things. i also enjoy stealing :x its fun taking a  ton of food & weapons. i feel like a bad a**. i think its worth $4.99 & $19.99 if you dont catch a sale.",1
"this is the best game ive ever played, by far. its so deep and theres so much you can do. 130 hours in, i ran out of big questlines to do and now ive been clearing all the dungeons i skipped over earlier in the game and redoing some old ones. with mods, the game can look like it was released last week, not over 3 years ago. also i hate the thalmor.",1
"best game ive played this year. one of the best games ive ever played.",1
"i usually hate games with spells and swords with elves running around the place. which made me avoid this game when it was released, all the more difficult to admit it may be one of the most enjoyable games i have ever played. expansive and involving with enough of a talented modding community around it to make even more beautiful to behold 10/10.",1
"buy it cause of the elder scrolls logo on the front, stay for the huge amount of mods, both useful and completely useless but amusing all the same",2
"an absolutely amazing title. over three hundred hours later, and i still have the urge to start up a new character and play through it all over again. a must-have for all fantasy rpg-ers; rich with lore, packed with loot, and more enemies than you can shake a fire-enchanted battle axe at.....what are you waiting for?! the entire time youve been reading this, you couldve been playing! get this game now!",2
"this is a great game, i would highly recommend it to anyone that loves either rpgs or open world adventures",1
"there are no words that can describe this game. just buy the damn thing and mod the hell out of it.",3
"the first thing i did when i bought skyrim was install the kenny loggins mod, i recommend you do so to.",1
"perfect for anyone with add. dont like the townsfolk? save and kill em all. dont like your character? start over. <3",2
"hell yeah! get it but not of steam, way too expensive.",1
"skyrim, what is there to say.. stupidly addicting open ended rpg. i was sold on elder scrolls back with daggerfall, who first made open ended rpgs like this as far as i know. anyways, it is never to lat to start such a amazng searies of games. i am so looking forward to eso when it comes out this year. i give this game 6 out of 5 stars and 3 thumbs up. :-d",1
"after hundreds of hours spent exploring the world and plundering the deepest and darkest dungeons, i realized that i have only just begun to touch on the main storyline of the game. so much to do, so much to see. but you dont have to take my word for it!",2
"10/10 skyrim still is and will be the game worth playing, whether for half an hour to kill a dragon or for many hours for massive exploration. to this day, i continue to find new things.",1
"it took all of my personal life including, my girlfriend, my family, my jobb, my money. 10/10 bananas",1
"best game ever 10/10 would throw a arrow in the eye and do 0 damage again.",1
"an epic rpg and the latest addition to the elder scrolls, skyrim is one good game! all i can possibly say to explain its awesomeness is: (in the words of taketherisk) youre a fool if you dont have this seriously though, get this game.",1
"what a game. played for hundreds of hours, got bored, modded it, and played for hundreds more.",1
"skyrim is the best rpg i have ever played. oblivion was awesome, but skyrim is is so much more better ! i really like the level system with the star constellations. the map is not too big and looks great, and for the little money you get so much game content like no other game. have so much fun playing this game.",1
"openworld dragon slaying at its finest. also, mods! replayability is infinite.",3
"this game is a beast! a friend recommended it to me, and i wasnt sure if i like this kind of genre. i only bought the standard edition. i started playing this game and couldnt stop anymore! i was addicted to this game and bought the legendary edition for the dlcs. i would definitely waste 15 bucks again.",1
"good game lots of fun cant wait for elder scrolls online",1
"this game has ing dragons so its ing cool as  play this  now!!!!!!!",1
"this is the perfect game for adventurer at home because there are tons of quest in this game enjoy!",1
"words cannot be put together to describe this game, but ill do my best. fantabulous. it is an incredibly immersive game with epic gameplay, good plot, good graphics, brilliant lore and awesome loot. should you get this? why do you not have it already? get it now!! 9.5/10",1
"an excellent game! it already has so much to do in there, but mod it and youve got more than you can ask for. its amazing!!",2
"play it for 25 hours, mod the hell out of it, play it for hundreds of hours, never pick it up again.",2
"an excellent and engaging addition to the elder scrolls series",1
"working on finishing skyrim on pc i have played it on xbox 360 and ps3 without dlc. i can say so far on pc its way more amazing in details and especially if you get into modding oh the amount of potential they unlock for skyrim.",1
"this is generally one of the best games i have played, thank you for hours of fun! :dd",1
"very nice game, almost endless amount of mods from the steam workshop. i only reached the ending once, and i was told later on there are multiple endings. replay value is amazing, cant wait to get into this game again. :]",1
"the best game i have ever played , and i starting to lose my life.. just buy it",1
"literally like the best thing ever. easily worth many times the price it is now available for",2
"note: i did not put over 200 hours into this game, i let my freind use my acount and him and his dad racked up these hours. quick thoughts: -it seems like the only people who like this game is people that either dont like rpgs or have never played a tes game. -this is not a rpg, its a action hack and slash game with rpg elements. -this game is like jumping into a ocean and finding out its a just a pool. -its riddled with things that make no sense and every quest is generic and boring. negitive: -its riddled with things that make no sense and every quest is generic and boring. -the leveling system is just and bad as oblivion. -dragons are way to easy to kill. -you need mods for it to be playable. -horrific ui -boring combat - arrow to the knee - companions - boring world - ruined magic - boring caves positves: - dual weapons is awsome! - music - dlc overall: 2/5",1
"basically imagine gta if gta were a middle age open world game where you kill dragons and have magic and the scenery is 20x better and everything is just 20x more awesome.",2
"whats to say about this game that hasnt been said already? 11/10 score from me. with over 500 hours clocked in theres no end in sight for what i could do in even one of my saves in this open-world fantasy rpg. the easy addition of mods makes this game literally endless. the land of skyrim is your canvas and you are the painter in this masterpiece of a game.",2
"pretty damned close to perfection. id place new vegas just a squeak ahead because fallout, but skyrim actually does some mechanics better. the only complaint id have is how easy it is to fall into the sneak and archery route. gorgeous, inviting, involving, and endless. a joy every gamer should experience.",2
"i used to have a life away from gaming but then i toke a skyrim to the knee. great game, one of the best i have ever played",3
"went up to a furry mammoth to make friends. see a giant running towards me. i run towards him. i say hi. he smashes me downward with his club. somehow, i am flying accross the beautiful snow mountains of skyrim. 11/10 would say hi again",1

"excellent game i cant believe i waited 2 years to finally play this. 1 gripe ....npc voices were lacking variety",1
"this is my no duh recommendation of the gaming season. other game making companies must feel like frauds when they fire up this game. the music, graphics and sheer open world size will blow you away.",1
"amazing game best open worlder there is cant wait for eso",1
"game decided to autosave while my game bugged out 10hours of my life lost 0/10 never again.",1
"ride a dragon, what else it is to say about the game?",1
"so in my first playthrough i went to whiterun first (obviously) met the preacher, killed the preacher infront of 3 guards and they did nothing. went up to the jarl, jumped onto the tables, scattered the dishes and attacked the steward in the back room, gaurds did nothing. i go to the court wizard, but steal sweetroll and you get killed",1
"it counts how many bunnies youve slaughtered 10/10",2
"i have played this game 24/7 for at least ten days straight.",1
"wonderful role playing game taking place in the world or the elder scrolls series, this time in a very nordic environment. nordic kings, mountains, wildlife, the land of skyrim offers a trully unique experience. you are the chosen one, the dragonborn, and only you will be able to fend off a threat seemingly back from the ancient times: dragons. however, your steps might take you to a path you originally didnt intend to wander accross. take on the role that fits you the most. design your own character among many different races. defeat your ennemies with the use of swords, daggers, hammers, and many other weapons. or learn to cast spells and set your foes on fire. brew your own potions using specific ingredients. craft and improve armors through metalwork and enchantments. pick up a weapon, and travel to the east, or the west, perhaps the north, only you can decide where your journey must begin. a definite must-have for anyone who love to explore unknown territories and adventure in heroic fantasy universes.",2
"great game! however i strongly recommend the pc version.",1
"shallow, contrived, easy, dumbed down, stripped down, terribly written, poor combat, dated animations, terrible ui, repetitive, lots of boring quests, bad voice acting, etc. its moddable and looks good which are the only things this game has going for it.",1
"absolute must have, the elder scrolls series have always been outstanding, with skyrims new graphics, and engines as well as mods to be released soon ( morrowsky taking you back to morrowind) this is a must have game",1
"best game ever in rpg, on single player, even now in 2015...",1
"i cant give this game enough praise. sure the main story lacks abit, but the sidequests, the world and especialy the modding community is amazing. the mods make this game one of the best games i have ever played.",2
"the best game storyline if to compare with fallout new vegas and deus ex hr. although the quests are so many, i meant so so many and sometimes annoying, the game never fails to impress.",2
"graphics: 6/6 sound: 6/6 controls: 5/6 replay ability: 5/6 dlc: 6/6 storyline: 6/6 notes: one of the best open world games. hours of exploring and quests. find and craft weapons. many skills and traits. [1] horrible [2] poor [3] fair [4] good [5] great [6] outstanding",2
"only a few hours into the game and i can already tell that its one of the best things i ever played. go check it out if you can, you wont regret it.",1
"this is genuinley such an incredible game, pick the legendary edition up on a steam sale and you wont want to put it down.",1
"grab the legendary edition over the x-mas sale. now that the game is complete it is a much more stable platform for modding. even though a couple years old now, skyrim is still graphically impressive, especially with hd texture and mesh upgrades. and of course skyrim has one of the best modding communities around.",1
"set roughly 200 years after the events of its previous game tes vi: oblivion you start off as a prisoner (again) who is on your way to helgen to be exucuted but you are saved by a dragon which attacks helgen. from then on your story begins developing your character in your way set an example of yourself to various people and joining in a civil war. in a graphical matter this game is aaa with extra mods using skse and graphical overhauls. this is clearly a major improvement from oblivion but gameplay roughly lacks. we have seen how successful this game is due to the meme i used to be a...... like you until i took an arrow to the knee a few days after its release. 11/10",2
"this game is one of the best games ever created. if you like digging into games, then this is a must buy. i dont have anything more to tell, only that you must have played this game at least 10 times in a lifetime.",1
"an awesome fifth installment to a legendary series. i heartily recommend this game if you enjoy exploration, in depth missions, and an exciting huge open world. the game can also be expanded hugely upon with the additions from the modding community.",2
"skyrim has all the elements that a rpg gamer wants along with some things that can catch the eyes of some older gamers...i give 10/10",1
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"i actually cant stand this game. i cant even find it immersive because pausing in the middle of fights to use potions and switch weapons doesnt really suck me in like a shamwow. even exploring the land is just like hey look, theres some more trees and mountains, nothing really exciting at all. the side quests are tedious as all hell cause they consist of you looking for something that someone forgot in a bandit cave. people always tell me that mods make it better, and yes, they do. mods are the only thing that make this game appealing to me, but mods dont excuse the base game from being trash.",1
"i can not reccomend a game that has got more bugs than any game i have ever played and bethesda does not distribute patches to fix game breaking issues, they let the community do all the dirty work & keep all the profits for a broken piece of crap product.",1
"lots of replay value, especially with the mods that you can add to this game.",1
"i good game that has a lot of promise to it pulling in the player from his seat to a great land where all is possible for the young... dovahkin.",1
"best rpg ive played to date. there is nothing else like it out there. the leveling system is my favorite of all the games ive played because of its intuitive leveling-by-practicing functionality. extremely fun to play with hundreds of hours of content and replay potential.",2

"i did not like this game because of the huge depressions within the game and the deadly mood i am surprised why people are so fans in this game with a ridiculous story that exist within the minds of the children !! i really regret because i bought this",1
"this a must buy for any rpg lover, if you loved oblivion or morrowind then you much buy this game. they have done an amazing job in creating this game. there is also the added feature for us pc users, mods! there seems to be no end to mods for this game!",3

"the game has a huge story which continues from the other elder scolls games. i suggest you play those games first if you truly want to understand the content of skyrim. i was suprised how good this game was when i first tried it, i always find something to do in this game, and there are more adventures hiding in every corner. very good, 10/10",1
"best game created / melhor jogo criado thanks bethesda / obrigado bethesda",1
"i bought this for full price no less than a month ago... great.",1
"a very expansive game, skyrims vast map is, if not the best, one of the best virtual world ever created. the map is full of things to do, prey to be hunted, ingredients to be collected, enemies to kill. not to mention the random creature spawn that makes the world of skyrim feels alive, not just scripted by the development team. when you turn that corner, there maybe some random npc giving you quest, some guy walking along the road that can train you in your way to become a speechcraft master, or an old orc warrior who seeks an honorable way to die. so much things to do, so much variety, which makes pouring hours upon hours on this amazing world feels exciting every single time. the main quest is epic, but compared to the many side quests in the world feels kinda dull. the freedom to build your own character is so liberating, particularly because of many strong arguments from many types of play. add to that many amazing mods which has already been created, makes this a truly living game which always evolve with new content. truly a great experience.",1
"tesv: the elder scrolls is a great, amazing game with incredible depth. i fully recommend it. 10/10",1
"this game is just fantastic to be honest the best game ive played ever whoever hasnt tried skyrim has not been introduced to the best of gaming this game has it all did i mention dragons? yep if you want a game to sit on your  for the next 2 weeks this is your game",2
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"this game is amazing. it has months worth of gameplay, and when you think youve finished everything go onto the workshop to get many more months of things to do. i used to have this game on xbox 360 but when i got on this i realised just how great it is. more and more mods come out for this game every single day. though i only have 66.7 hours on record they have been filled with fun. if this isnt enough for you then get legendary edition where you can ride dragons and become a huge vampire! even better than that is that you can fus ro da goats off cliffs. you can even hear one of the most over used memes to date i used to be a adventurer like you untill i took an arrow to the knee and stab nazeem every single time he saids something stuck up. 99/10 would fus ro da again",1
"awesome game, i strongly recommend it. great storyline, good graphics and also downloadable mods from steam workshop which are a lot of fun. 10/10",1
"awesome open world game. lots of fun just walking around and doing quests. combat and quest system is still a bit shallow, but mods allow you to customize it some extent. overall i had a great time playing the game even if ive only scratched the surface on all the content available in the game.",1
"the only way that this game could be better is by adding either pokemon or the legend of zelda! the pc version is better by far as there are bearly any bugs other than the odd frostbite spiders xd. 8/10",1
"absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best games ive ever played. hundreds of hours of gameplay, endless amounts of content and massive, detailed areas, theres always something new to find and see, something new to experience, some new way to play. this game appears very high on my favorite games list, among other fantastic games like earthbound, just cause 2 and starbound. the leveling system is pretty intuitive, the whole no classes, just your playstyle is something from the mind of a genius, and the dlcs just add even more amazingness to an already phenomenal game. my only complaint is that around level 30-50 (depending on difficulty level), youll notice an immense spike in difficulty, so much so it can sometimes be difficult to play. its usually not too much of a problem, but there has been a case or two where its stopped me. i have logged probably 1000 hours between the xbox and pc versions. this game is a must have for any rpg fan. hell, its must have, period.",2

"very fun love all the sidequest and added on dlc quests my rating 10/10",1
"skyrim is an excellent rpg capable of suck many hours from your life. it tells numerous engaging stories and delivers an immersive experience in the frozen nothern lands of skyrim. if youve played other elder scrolls titles you have a decent idea of what to expect, if not youre likely going to be pleasantly suprised. the steam workshop mod support for this game open up a contanstly growing database of new, east to install content. well worth the money.",2
"why are you reading this review? buy this game, get mods, have fun!",1
"i waited about a year for this to come out on console, and i have to say that im not dissapointed. i first bought the game on console wich there is no community workshop to download from. but even with no community created items the game is amazing, buityful, even better than i imagined. 9.8 out of 10",1

"one of the best role playing games out there! great medieval and magical type combat! vast world that looks very beautiful! id recommend you have a computer that can handle better games. so many quests you can do and the dlc i think are worth it.",1
"better than morrowind, kinda. you should probably buy this when its on sale because it may or may not be worth it otherwise. it gets a lot of really good publicity and reputation, and depending on your viewpoint of single-player fantasy rpgs, that is probably at least mostly deserved.",1
"ahh, skyrim. this game was more than a game, it was honestly an experience. when i first played it back in 2011 when it was released, it blew my mind away with how amazing every second of gameplay was. i first played the elder scrolls in 2010 in oblivion, and that was one of the best decisions in gaming i had ever made. seriously, if you havent played skyrim, let alone the elder scrolls series, you owe it to yourself to play it. it is more than just a game..",1
"i honestly have no idea what i can say about this. it is literally one of the best fantasy rpgs ive ever played (this is very high praise coming from someone who doesnt like fnatasy games and didnt enjoy oblivion). bethesda have contunied their tradition of providing an rpg with a massive world to explore and allow the player a lot of freedom in this world. if you get this game, then you should get some mods for it. the workshop here on steam provides a lot of mods already, but for the best of the best i recommend you head over to the nexus and check out the mods. your character progresses with the way you play. instead of assigning points to skills, each skill levels up as you use it. this allows a lot of different play styles and encourages a lot of playthroughs. i honestly cannot recommend this enough 10/10.",1
"fantastic game! i own it on ps3 and pc, and i have to say that this game has been my favorite since it came out. i remember the first day i bought it (11/11/11), i couldnt stop playing for months! i finally took a break because school started again, and now im back, graduated, and playing this game. i just bought dawnguard and it looks sweet! its a good buy for only $20 dlc. i absolutely love this game. cant wait for the next. i give it a 9.8 :)",1

"i played skyrim on the 360 when it first came out and really enjoyed the game but the quality and replayablity is so much higher on pc. between mods, higher graphics and graphical mods its like playing a whole new game.",1
"even after nearly 3 years skyrim is still one of the best open world games out there in my opinion.",1
"now with over 150 hours on record i can wholeheartedly recommend this game. skyrim has almost everything i could have ever wanted from an action-rpg game, save for dialogue options, which can be overlooked in such a massive game. quests are mostly varied, although due to the size of the game some repetition is bound to occur. i have only now, after more than hundred hours of gameplay, begun to run out of quests, and i suspect there are still some to be discovered. skyrim, just as all the previous tes games, comes with a good selection of races, classes and playstyles, adding to the already great replay value from quest choices. regarding overall gameplay, i feel skyrim is a slightly casual experience as whole (at least within the rpg genre), being relatively easy with a short learning curve, but it blends action and awesome story writing together into a very attractive mix that nobody even slightly interested in fantasy adventure should miss. on top of all this, there is also a very active modding community, adding potentially hundreds more hours of gameplay.",2
"its like oblivion except that its not a generic, boring, poorly conceived piece of . but that doesnt make it any less of a console port that the pc community will have to mop up again.",3
"not superior to oblivion or morrowind iii imo, but another excellent instalment to tes games.",1
"one of the best rpg games i have ever played so far",1
"much easier to get into than oblivion and morrowwind, and much better looking. i love the multiple perk trees within disciplines, which helps to differentiate characters and playstyles. definitely pick up some mods, though: the unofficial patches to help with general bugs and glitches, sky ui to better the inventory screens, and  if youre feeling tired of the current perk systems.",1
"this is my favorite game of all time i still play it even if i have beat it a couple times because it is so big!",1
"i could( and do) play this game for hours, theres always something to do!",1
"woah this game brings me way back. this game can keep you going for hours and hours with the objectives. if you wanna play this game, be sure you have enough time on your hands. other than that, i dont think its much of a problem. gameplay is awesome. graphics are amazing (especially at sovngarde). soundtrack matches so well with skyrim, it kinda makes me feel nostalgic. i dont think i have anything else to say about this game. just to wrap it up, its just really addictive and entertaining. overall i give it 87/100. go play it now!",1
"seriously fun! probably one of the best games ive ever played. endless hours of content and the workshop makes the game 10x more dynamic, its worth every penny.",1
"probably the best game ever made until they make another one. great graphics, fantastic community mods, and everything about it makes me gay. 10/10 would play again",1

"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",1
"what is there to say about skyrim that already hasnt? it is a land which i find my self always wanting to go back to see more of. while not the most intense game out there, it strikes the perfect balance of gameplay and relaxation.",1
"subtract everuthing you hate about past elder scrolls games, add evrything you love, add a better engine that does not crash on you every 10 minutes and is not a steaming pile of bugs, pretty up everything, make the faces cooler and make just about everything better and you have skyrim. this game is a masterpiece, its the game that we have been waiting for in 2011, (most titles this year have been bad to say the least) this gmae would deserve a perfect 10 if not for the super lame secondary main quest which is the civil war, you can kill the final boss in one hit, i understand that level scaling is bad in most cases, but in some cases things have to be level scaled. the annoying part is, the civil war is about the length of the dragon questline! this game would get a 9.7 in my book now, thanks to that one little detail, but since metacr---steam forces me to round up my score, 10 it is! also, if you really want to complain about the crappy interface of how you painfully select everything and how its built for a controller, do one of the following things : get a mod, or use a controller, we all have usb ports! 12/10 its alright",1

"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",1

"epiiiic! i got this game two years ago on a different account, so my current 14 gameplay hours is a lie. this game, is so freaking awesome, you can replay the story line several times as different role-play characters. its such an open world game, you can do anything really. theres no building, but theres skills and smithing, etc. the combat mechanics are great, the graphics are great, especially on ultra (if you can handle it without lag). i always come back to this game to live out a different life each time.",1
"what can i say? its a superb game. who doesnt like shouting at dragons?",1
"when you originally play the game its fun...but then when you install 100 mods it gets reeaaaal fun!",1
"i was so disappointed in this game. almost three years after release, there are still quest bugs. completely unforgivable. this is no rpg, this is an action game with an rpg veneer.",1
"i love almost everything that bethesda makes and this game is the best one yet. i hope the next fallout game uses some of the new features this game presented us. the dlcs are good add-ons and the creation kit makes this even more fun if you want to create your own content.",3
"after a 5 year break from pc gaming (been on xbox360) ive come back to see how things have changed. well, all i can say is im glad to be back ! the 360 version of skyrim looks great (for a machine thats basically 8 years old) but playing it on pc running 1080p & ultra settings, the game looks fabulous. im looking forward to checking out some of the mods that are available, but in the meantime im just enjoying wandering about the world.",1
"really? you have to read a recommendation to decide whether or not to get this game? just buy it! buy it now!",1
"this can easily be the most immersive game i have played! i find myself playing hours after hours after hours without even noticing it. everything about this game is so finely made. my only wish is that it had subtitles. if youre a serious gamer, and have been missing skyrim, go get it. you wont regret it.",1
"come on, this is skyrim. everyone knows its a great game, and everyone needs to play it. period.",1
"when i played skyrim for the first time, i was blown away by the attention to detail, and the vast variety of quests and locations to discover. to those who treat morrowind like it is the holy game, take those nostalgia goggles off! seriously, this game has not been dumned down. skyrim has improved on many features which morrowind and oblivion first implemented. my favourite part of the game is interactibility, while my least favourite part of skyrim are the amount of glitches. not gamebreaking, just annoying. 9.5/10",2

"wonderful graphics and an in depth storyline, i love this game.",1
"since i got this game ive played it quite a lot, and i must say i still enjoy playing it a bit, every now and then ... but only a bit of play at a time :p it is one of the best games ive played so far, and its fantastic modding community keeps it alive and breathing. ive even made a mod myself! :) though it has its flaws (the so-called elder scrolls bugs, or ... whatever it is they call it :p) i highly recommend everyone to try it out!",3
"(6.6.14 edit) finished vanilla and all three dlcs. finished all 75 achievements. the game with its radiant questing system and open world exploring will never leave you lacking for content. the mod community is the strongest for any pc game on the market, and some of the mods like falskaar and wyrmstooth are dlc-sized new lands. skyrim is a place where you can create any adventurer you want without having to fit into rpg tropes. it is graphically beautiful, especially when modded, and offers endless amounts of replayability. the sounds and evnvironment are immersive, also improved with modding. this is as close as there is to a perfect game. (caveat: dawnguard was not all that great...but dragonborn is epic. that makes up for it.) (5.17.14) well. hours played = enough said. depth of game plus mod community are enough to keep you entertained for literal months on end. i dont think its a stretch to say this is the greatest rpg ever made. and thats coming form a final fantasy fan.",3
"i have had about 400 hours on this (even though steam says 100 odd) and i can say it takes a very long time complete.there is a very good main story and alot of fun side quests.this game has an amazing amount of witch only gets better if you get the dlcs.i would get this game anyway but you may want to wait for a sale as you can pick up very cheap.you may also want to check out the ledgendary edition.",1
"( i started playing skyrim on xbox, i have 1,000,000,000 hours gameplay ) to start, this is the best game that you will ever play! if you are like me and you started playing oblivion and started not exactly knowing whats going on this few months down the line you start to get it then you have brought this game and it feels like you have just had sex with asa akira. well if your new to tes then i would start playing previous games to get the understanding of the game but if not you dont nessercerly need to because every game is so amazing and has its own style, but this game completely took away my life... full of quests... you will never complete this game... main story line could have been longer but it is still my favourite story line of any game and just the general size of the map is just great! if you dont know what tes is about and you just want to use a bow and shoot someone in the face, or push someone off the edge of a mountain or try overcome your phobia of spiders then this is the game for you! you can do what you like when you like! its everything you imagine it to be! but please this taken away my school life and social life! this is really worth 10 its the best game in the world!",1
"if you dont know what this game is, then youve probably been living under a rock. the popularity of the elder scrolls has exploded into ever larger proportions with every installment, but this is the game that propeled the series into modern gamer pop-culture. its not perfect, there are numerous bugs. but the world is so detailed and immersive you usually wont care. no first person fantasy role playing game out there can even compare to the level of detail and realism found here. with this game, its so easy to just lose yourself and play hour after hour longer than you wanted/should have. and as always with the elder scrolls, you can actually role play a bit with the world around you. the series has also caught attention since its third installment for its ease of customization. the included mod making software with these games makes it easy to make your own content, and its even easier to use mods others have designed. but skyrim takes the crown for moddability, with the addition of steam workshop support. simply put, this is a highly customizable, immersive, single player adventure. one that every rpg, fantasy, and adventure fanatic should play.",1
"very good game if you like rpg games worth the money",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best games i have ever had the pleasure of playing. in my opinion it easily keeps up with the other games in the series, and one thing that makes this game better is the fact that the combat system feels less constricting and the movement just feels a lot more realistic. skyrim has everything that oblivion lacked, like modern graphics, a better combat system and more balanced races and a better spell-system, but however lacks one of my favorite features from oblivion; creating your own spells, although it has a wider variety of spells for the different schools. the story line is simply great and after finishing (or before?) the main story line you still have hundreds of hours fun left in this game, which gives it 10/10 stars from me.",1
"this is on of the two best rpg games. oblivion being the other. so many quest and things to slay!",4
"there is so much to do in this game. you could play for a whole year and still not be done with the game. there are so many great mods that you can try as well that may make the graphics, or gameplay truly fit your personal gaming experience. there is also so much freedom in the game to do whatever you want to do. i would say, if you only have money to buy one game, get skyrim. itll keep you occupied forever! 10/10",1
"no multiplayer, and no linux support. bethesda shouldnt be releasing a half-developed game.",1
"skyrim is second only to oblivion, and thats only because of one aspect that will probably surpass it at some time. the mods for skyrim are good, some are even fairly amazing and world making, but its still nothing compared to the amount of mods and the quality of mods for oblivion. skyrim is overall amazing, save for the combat (though that can be modded to a degree) and the main story lacking in any real substance besides kill x to make sure world doesnt end. i got my moneys worth out of it, especially with the dlc (my favorite being dawnguard). 7.5/10, would buy and play again.",2
"definately one of the best rpg games ever made and well worth purchasing.",1
"this game will most likely take over your life. 10/10 would recommend",1
"a just all around awesome game! so much to do and so much freedom! :d",1
"this game is one of the best games ive played. despite the fact i find it less appealing than its older brother elder scrolls iv: oblivion it is still just as fun. i have over 300 hours in one character, and around 170-200 hours on the other. this game is one of those games that dont really get boring (even in the later parts of the game) i recommend picking this game up if you want a game to play for a very long time. if youre on a low budget like me then youll want to pick this up while you save up for the next game youre going to purchase. even after you complete this game 100%, there are still mods out there that add hundreds of hours of gameplay afterwards. definitely pick this beauty up.",1
"what can i say about skyrim? only place where you can say you took a arrow to the knee, or get hit for a home run by a giant! but skyrim has endless possibilities!",1
"stunning and beautiful game with a huge world for discovering as well as a great modding community!",1
"as if anything needs to be said here...recommended!",1
"rubbish.... do not waste your money on this game. no demo or trial period so bought based on reviews. character choice is poor, ugly, out of proportion. animation poor, unatural, run like a gorilla, response poor. ui poor, clunky. instructions poor, map poor, not easy to use. npcs repetitive, speech patterns repetitive, uninteresting, discussions are too long. scenery is good, but you cant base the quality of a game on scernery alone. buy a dvd if you want good scenery. the potential is there for a good game. the game needs a revamp, updating and de-buggged. overall i am disappointed with this purcahse and will not be investing in anymore elder scroll games.",1
"i could type up a long review for this game and explain how great it is in-detail. but words cant describe such a beautiful game. it released in 2011, and still graphically tops most releases today. and with mods only further improving the aesthetics, its amazing eye candy. the main story is average. but with the tons and tons of side-quests, it comes together for an amazing universe and story with great lore. ive found myself spending a lot of time simply reading the books within the game. the sword combat isnt anything to write home about. its the same as all tes games, though, and sadly isnt on par with oblivions difficulty. but throw in magic and other ways to fight, its still entertaining. the environments are amazing. throwing away the bland and copy-paste dungeons of oblivion, each new location is filled with fun enemies and beautiful views. all in all, skyrim is my most played title and amazing in every right. if you are still thinking about getting skyrim, i recommend you do it asap. with tons of mods to fix the slightest problems you might find or to simply improve your own experience, its a game that hardly ever gets old. i highly recommend you get it.",2
"have spent almost 500 hours in this game and am still finding new things, the adventure will never die",2

"its hard to say anything more about this game. its awesome!",1
"great game from start to finish, visually stunning, hours and hours of exploration, very intense storyline. hundreds of hours of side missions, which can get pretty interesting, and have an impact on the world. this is a true free roaming game, with choices that will impact the world around you. its very hard not to enjoy this game. 5/5",1
"ever since the first entry, the elder scrolls series has always featured an amazing story. skyrim delivers a beautiful environement, incredibly smooth gameplay, and an amazing soundtrack. however, the story does not measure up to previous entries. while there are an overwhelming number of quests, many of them are copy and paste fetch quests. the main story line and guild story lines can easily be finished in less than 4 hours each. while the gameplay is significantly improved from oblivion, the dificulty has dropped greatly. very often the most frustrating encounters in the game involve killing a randomly generated dragon only to find out it has killed a quest giver you were on your way to speak with. however, it must be said that the very active skyrim modding community has produced hundreds of mods that make this game worth the cost.",1
"the elder scrolls iv: oblivion was a rly good game... skyrim is better! :d you must buy this game! (waiting for the elder scrolls online :d)",2
"skyrim is truely the best game i have ever played in my entire life. ive played various of game such as super mario bros and pokemon as a kid. growing up i began playing more violent games like grand theft auto, call of duty, street fighter 4, etc etc. everything about skyrim is really good. the soundtrack brought life to the game and enviroment in my opinion. the graphics and looks on the game is beautiful. several quests to do that will keep you playing after the main story quests. the best part of skyrim is that you can mod it to your liking, it could be skins, adventures mod, this game will keep you enterain for a long time. i dont normally do reviews either, but this game is as good as people say it is.",1
"i just cant stop playing it, this is a super awesome fascinating masterpiece in game history,every rpg fan should try it, im sure you wont be disappointed with it!",1
"if you like open world rpgs with a huge story and tons of adventure, get this game now.",1
"oblivion and morrowind are much better in any aspect besides the graphics, the game is still okay and enjoyable",1
"love it so much that i dont want to stop playing. 5 stars out of 5",3
"do i have to really say anything anything? its skyrim (mods!)",1
"amazing 10/10 its just soo good so much stuff to do quest wise the story may be short and hopefully isnt the reason y your buying it but i would recomend this to any gamer with 200 hours to spare",1
"great game. the best open-world game bethesda has made yet in my opinion. now with the dlcs the game seems endless, and you will spend many dozens of hours just questing alone even before exploring all of skyrim. hope you have a lot of extra time on your hands. ;)",2
"i love the open world option in the game. the way you can go and explore the world and your own leasure. you can take on many different quests in so many locations that it keeps you entertained throughout. your skilling up is also done at a pace that keeps the fights and battles interesting. the scenery is breathtaking, the detail awesome, the realism fantastic. i think this game ranks 10/10 and to me is the top of all rpg games. bethesda has done an awesome job. now i would love for them to upgrade both morrowind and oblivion to the same standard as skyrim. i have the whole set from arena through to skyrim and each game got better and better. well done to all the modders out there that have done a fantastic job to add more spice to the game. i would definitely recommend this game to every single rpg player in the world. a must have. cant wait to see if there are more expansions in the making.",2
"much better experience than the console versions. although i got extremely far on console, i am fine with restarting and experiencing it again in a stunning graphics and play jump.",1
"not my most played game but holy crap is it the most immersive. i poured so much into this game and still feel like its new evrytime i boot it up. 5 stars would reccomend.",2
"if you like adventure this one is for you. best rpg ever",1
"got skyrim thought it was good... but then i discorverd solsthim (forgot how to spell it :/ ) epic. added workshop items even better than epic... godly thats all ihave to say really.",2
"modding makes skyrim better than it already is. the storyline is fun, the dlc is great, and you get to kill dragons. whats better than killing dragons and stealing their souls?",1
"flipping awesome and its huge too many things to do so many things to see",2
"more than a perfect game for spend hours and hours and nver get tired and never runout of things to do and explore awesome game! totally recomended",1
"absolutely worth it. never completed oblivion because monsters levelled up with the character, but this time they absolutely got it right.",1
"95 hours played, and still more places to visit, more quests to do and new things to discover, this before the modders have even had their way with it. unlike oblivion, skyrim had character, dungeons no longer have the identikit feel, and while it still feels as though every citizen of skyrim has the exact same things to say, at least they are no longer saying it in the exact same voice. yes, it has a poor interface, linear quests and linear dungeons, but it is a huge, absorbing, albeit flawed gem of a game.",1
"having not played this game yet should be a criminal offence.",1
"i spent way too much time in this game, it was all worth it.",1
"super fun. never uninstalled. replay all the time.",1
"its the best game on steam.ruined my life....oh wait i dont have one",1
"great game, beautiful large open world, good storylines, interesting characters, and dragons! large replay value in playing other races, roleplaying, ....",1
"game looks great plays well and has a ton of exploration and sercrets and things for you to do! 9/10!",1
"102 hours so far on one character completed 3 of the main quest line. rest of the time spent levelling and side questing still not bored 10/10",1
"did you ever dream of being a dragonborn, a dovahkiin? no? this is your chance to embody the powerful person that you are not! buy skyrim now and explore the elder scrolls: skyrim to the fullest. skyrim might just be the best game you will have played in years.",1
"if your a fan of the single player rpg genre, then this is the game for you. amazing graphics, huge areas to explore, very nice gameplay, and endless hours of fun. i also suggest checking the elders scrolls online if your into the mmorpg genre, its coming up in april and it looks like it could be the game to end the wow era. the storyline is very compelling, even though u can be overwelmed by the amount of quests you have at some point, at least if u play like me who tries to be a perfectionist and talks and tries everything, but an amazing game overall. i advise you to buy it with all the expansion content (just for an amazing 19.90), and give it a go, you wont regret it.",1
"skyrim is a wonderful game for the adventurus and the blood thursty kind its full of medi evil stuff and fictunal charicters. but now for the review, skrim elder scrolls is a very good game considersing voice acting and graphics although for the acasional bug or 2, i really do love this game and it is a good game to waste a couple of days on i give it a 9/10.",1
"everyone: i cannot recommend this game enough. the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is amazing, they story if phenominal, and the everything else fits somewhere in those catagories. buy it!",1
"lets all come to a conclusion that werewolves are overpowered and the vampires suck.",1
"by far one of the most fun rpg like games ive ever played. the only problem is i cant stop playing this awesome game!",2
"the best game to mess around in especially if youre bored.",1
"skyrim is thrilling game, and it is overally balanced out. cheats are nice though.",1
"probably my all time favorite game. the graphics are great, combat system too. diverse nature and dungeons, many quests and great overall gameplay. 11/10",1
"must own. played the crap outta my 360 version, and with a good pc and especially the legendary edition its soooooooooooo much better",1
"i love the open play of this game. the world is visually pleasing and wonderfully created. its nice to have a main quest with hundreds of side quests. there is so much to do in this game if you love to explore. it is an rpg players paradise. i definitely recommend this game.",2
"by far one of my favorite games of all time you will love it.",3
"goty. need i say more? no, i dont. just get this game, its on sale every 4 minutes and always under 10 euros. if you dont own skyrim, you are a fool.",1
"well, it is next game in very popular rpg series the elder scrolls from bethesda. it is really amazing game for rpg lovers. open world, two handed combat system and leveling systems are just great. you can also craft a lot of stuff. you can simpy do whatever you want, buy a house, marry a wife or just go to dungeon and kill them all in. i can strongly recommend this game. ps: if you wish to improve graphic experience, just visit skyrimnexus and download some mods. ;-)",1
"a really amazing game, great graphics, i love the freedom to dojust about anything i want and the dlcs deffinately keep it interesting, and i always find i can go back to it after a long break.",1
"great game, great mods, great dragons, great everything",1
"i have over 200 mods installed and still cant roleplay my character correctly. 10/10",2
"hyped up for almost a year for this, i wasnt disappointed when i played this. the graphics, gameplay and sounds in this game are amazing. some people say this is bad compared to morrowind, but i havent played it so i couldnt make a comparison. if youre looking for a good rpg experience in a medieval setting, this game is great.",1
"definitely a game worth getting. this game by itself is fantastic and it only gets better when you start adding in mods.",1
"combat and gameplay: mediocre and repetitive. every weapon has the same mechanic and animation. every dungeon has the same structure, puzzles and enemies. besides, this game still makes use of the outdated game engine in fallout 3, oblivion and morrowind, thus player movement still has an unrealistic feel just like in previous bethesda rpgs. world building: fantasy 101. this game includes all the tropes ive been tired of seeing: elves, dwarves, thieves, mages, ... and offers nothing new. story line: weak and uninteresting. multiple story arcs happen at the same time, yet each one is simple and not connected to one another. overall impression: unimpressive and tedious. 6 out of 10. play witcher, dragon age or mass effect instead. p/s: also games full of bugs and faulty ai.",1
"find that you just have too much time on your hands? buy this game and youll never have that problem again. ever!!",1
"yo homes i punched a dragon to death. 5/4 would praise the based god again",1
"great game with so much to do. worth replaying again and again.",2
"if you dont own this game and, your a big fantasy rpg gamer ask your self what the hell are you waiting for because it is a must! own 5-star title.",1
"sure, it was okay, but id really like my money back, since i bought the game when it was 60 dollars, before it shifted down to 20... :p",1
"awsome so many quest so much to do never get bored 5 star no 100 star",1
"ive played this skyrim waaaay more than any human should play any game on my 360 back before i moved to pc and i could write a stupidly long review about it because i am such a damn fanboy, so ill try to make this short. haha... this game has no bad qualities i can think of other than some bugs here and there, and the combat can feel clunky at times. if youre willing to invest a lot of time in a game than i see no reason not to get skyrim unless youre too cool for involved rpgs.",1
"a great openworld sandbox with a solid story. a good 20 hours of main story quests. but thats not it, there are thousands of mods and quite a few side quests. one of the best games i have ever played!",1
"skyrim, you bane of time management. skyrim, you bane of my life. skyrim, you bane of my boredom. skyrim, you bane of my strife. oh look, that rhymed.",1
"most moddable game youll ever play. chivallery and  you know what i mean !! recommand 100 %",1
"ive never got past the first main story mission because i got distracted by all the other awesome stuff this game has got to offer. do yourself a huge favor and buy this game.",1
"well, its skyrim- it has dragons, epic quests, a lot fo stuff to do, epic spells and equipments, amazing feel to it. stop reading all the positive reviews and get it, you wont regret it. a bar for tes vi has been set. 11/10",1
"great game! i would definetly recommend this to anybody who has the money.",1
"this game troubles me in ways but in others makes me want to play for days on end",1
"you can never get enough for this game, highly recommend for those role player you can write your own story every time you play new character!",1

"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",1
"although the follower limit is 1, i somehow have 3 and i know how to get a 4th. gg also bakestabes do 30x damage and one-shot everything. would buy again 11/10",1
"words can not even discribe this game. this has to be the my favorate game of all time becuse ive played 388.4 hours. and ive compled the game 3 times as mage warrior and theif. ive been playing sinse 2012 so that is alomst 3 years and i realised that you can never be done with an elder scrolls game.ive been olny playing straght no extra game that just goes to show unbeliveble the map and there is a welth of dongens to clear and things to game and i havent even played with it dlcs i bought this game for 50ish bucks and it was totaly it i have played oblivion and morroiwind they were amizing so im recomening skyrim but im realy recomending the elder scrolls. {expt for elder scrollls online that sucked] the olnt poroblem is that i belive that if theres about 50 markarth witch is not that much for the bigest city in the nation witch is sad becuse they have like the world worse populaion. i think they should have had more peole in conculison igive this game a 100/ 100",2
"as a huge elder scrolls fan, i am pathetic when it comes to how many versions of this game i own. i have played skyrim on ps3, xbox 360, and then now on pc. its a very well made game and i whole-heartedly love it. the open world and countless quests provide days or even weeks of fun rather than hours. ive noticed there are mods galore for the pc version so its like adding even more time to that.",1
"one of my favourite games has an ansane amount of things you can do, i am currently a spell casting assassin that uses a bow, you can be any type of hero,anti-hero, or villan you want with countless hours of replayability",1
"easily one of my favorite games. its also a great bang for your buck, providing many hours of enjoyment for not much money.",2
"a game where you forget to eat, sleep and make friends because youre too busy eating, sleeping, and making friends in game. and occassionally kill dragons.",1
"shout to make anyone in your way ragdoll, kill chickens and become the most villianous person in the province, ride a horse up a vertical mountain, skyrim is just fun. just buy it. now.",1
"i spent 100 hours on this game when it came out i didnt even finish the main quest. the side quests are pretty indepth and very fun to explore this huge world. the main story i thought was pretty boring, not sure if the ending makes up for it as i never got there. the combat is pretty poor, fighting mechanics have like no complexity at all. i tried getting back into it for a new play through or just finish the story and just couldnt get back into it.",1
"i know its 4 years late for me to write a review but i still meet people who have never played an elder scrolls game o_o! so for those looking at this...just buy it! this game is a masterpiece and we need more games like this. not to mention with the addition of mods makes skyrim that much better. somehow here on steam people have left negative reviews on skyrim. i dont even understand how skyrim can have a single negative review aginast it other than trolls buy the game 10000/10",2
"this is to me the greatest game of all times. i highly recommend this game to any type of player. its fun, and you can always go on new adventures. plus you can install from thousands of different mods to make the game play, look, and feel how you want it. greatest game ever.",1
"while not as fun as morrowind or oblivion, it is worth playing.",1
"i love this game, i recommend this to anyone who enjoys rpgs.",1
"its nothing compared to the games its trying to follow. and not worth buying.",1
"if youve lived under a rock for the past 2 years you might not know that this is a good game. has its problems, bugs, ect, but its a great game. the combat system suffers from being either too complicated (as a mage or whatever) or being way too simple (as a basic warrior / archer)",2
"it starts as an epic fantasy game and ends as a file organizing and landscaping simulator.",5
"i really freaking love skyrim! i love this game because it is beautiful, humorous, fun to play and simply amazing! also, you can use the game with/without mods and you still wont get bored! i love the fact that you can create your character to be what you want them to be, make them get better at certian things. id reccomend this to anyone who enjoys medievil/fantasy rpg games.",1
"i think i need to go to rehab or something, this is ing addicting.",1
"what can i say that hasnt already been said about this game? just piling on the kudos for a very open game world which you can mod to be even more awesome. the base game is very fun to play and though the combat can be a bit clunky sometimes, you can sink hours and hours into this game. i usually play offline so it doesnt have my total hours here correctly, but ive sunk over 300 hours into this game. and the mods! check out the flora mods, the hi-res mods, difficulties, all either lore inspired or just way out there. awesome game and extremely highly recommended. i still get sucked into playing this game for hours after taking a few months break on it.",1
"completely incompareable to any other rpg game out there. ive never played a finer game in a finer series of games. the amount of time you could spend doing anything is endless. in an open free, vast world, theres plenty of room to do whatever you want, and thats just the regular game! the mod community for skyrim is unlike any i have other seen, and that just sweetens the experience on top of the already-outstanding official dlc that goes with it. it really did live up to its potential in the elder scrolls series, and even exceeded it. after playing morrowind and oblivion, i can say that i have nothing to be upset with. as a former player of morrowind and oblivion, i have only just recently gotten skyrim for pc, and it still doesnt get old. my advice would be that if able, try out a bit of morrowind, and oblivion so you can get your taste set in on the elder scrolls, or if you want, you can just jump right into skyrim. the graphics: 10/10 the storyline: 10/10 the choices: 10/10 recommendation: buy this game (now)",1
"ok, for those of you who have already played past elder scrolls series games, ive only one thing to say: buy it! for the rest of you who havent, read on: skyrim is the 5th installment in the elder scrolls series by bethesda. its set in the frozen north of tamriel (the name of the continent) and you start as a prisoner of the empire on your way for execution. events will quickly put you in the story and as it turns out you have a special connection to the dragons, who have recently made their appearance again. graphics are very good and overall the game is awesome and very very very flexible to mod. it can get very immersive and you wont get up from the pc for many hours! totally recommended for rpg maniacs out there.",3
"elder scrolls v is the first game ive played in the series. it would be a fantastic game even if it wasnt already part of an amazing and innovative franchise. you start the game a prisoner in a wagon and the story unfolds from there. you can choose to do different things that may or may not affect how the rest of the game works out. by killing enemies and do certain things like picking locks, going on quest, swing your sword, shooting your bow you will earn exp. when you get a certain amount of exp you will be able to choose a skill to levelup in. skills like archy which increases power and accuracy with the bow., or one-handed swords which will increase the power of swords you swing with only one hand. the graphics and envirments are awesome! unfortunly my computer which im using to make this review cannt handle the awesome that is... skyrim.",1

"theres ways to get into shape and look sexy at the same time. the trick is, olive oil. also, youve really got to learn how to hold a pose like a professional. note, that not everyone can be a barrel-chested savage, like yours truly. that means, things may be a bit more difficult for all the normals out there. we all cant have won the genetic lottery. not all of us have viking dna coursing through our perfectly sized veins. ive gone on 42 hour persistence hunts. i have 20/10 vision. i can spot the seems on a 90 mph fastball. one step at a time, folks.",1

"bethesdas finest hour and one of the greatest rpgs of all time.",1
"its a good game in itself. you just cant have too many mods on it else it will crash.",1
"amazing game worth the price and it gets even better withe the dlcs but the main quest is too short but it doesnt matter because u get hours of gameplay with side quests",1
"four things: -dual wield weapons -fight dragons -shoot lasers from both hands -fus ro dah! p.s. this is pc version so mod this  or gtfo.",1
"where should i start ? before i start the review i played this game over 5 times on the xbox360 but why did i buy it also on the pc well because of the mods dlcs and more that made me play this game another 3 times then i found out that skyrim is really easy to mod so yeah... i played even more until i also found a mod that you can level up till level 350 i had 700 hours but a bug happend and it rested all my hours so yeah.... want to play a game that literally endless replay ability well  this the game for you  man i got sucked into it more then a leech to a fat guy with diabetes 10/10 game of the years 2011 - 2014",1
"no matter how bored i get of it, i will get back on it. i get bored of it because i have played over 1000 hours of this freaking game. i would say that this is definately my favorite game of all time, and i recommend this game to all. you dont really even have to know the backstory, and it still will be fun! i think that everyone should play this game!",2
"killed a dragon, no one bats an eye killed a chicken, a whole village loses their mind 10/10 would shoot arrows at the villagers knees",1
"this is truely an epic fantasy retold but the pc virsion is very lagey i sugest you get for consel likke ps3 or xbox 360 but the cool part about the pc virion is the mod i recamind it if you have a fast computer becuse this game is big",1
"i killed chicken in town everyone wanted to kill me 10/10",1
"man, what can i even say? its simply the best, never-ending singleplayer. 20/10",1
"verry good game, good graphics, verry good ideea, good story; from me 9/10.",1
"leave a city... fight a dragon..fast travel to a location.....fight a dragon......discover a new location....fight a dragon. 9/10 would fight dragons all day",1
"best. game. ever. this is a game you could spend your whole life and playing and still not finish. its full of sidequests aswell as the free-roam which is never ending fun. i bought this game on pc and xbox 360 and finished the main games quest 14 times :d an absolutely must have ! 10/10",1
"kill bandits, beat up mean ladies, steal horses. best game ever period.",1
"in my opinion, i believe skyrim to be the best elder scrolls game bethesda has made. it has the best ever graphics ive seen. its the neverending game, due to the workshop and the tortureable kids.",2
"this game will make u waste ur life....but its worth it",1
"ive waited this game more than any christmas ever, since ive beaten the oblivion weeks after the release. its gonna be so damn great and glorious ;-; over 2 years later: still rocking! i just stuffed 20 potatoes in my face while spider was eating my arm, lydia watches me masturbate and kids wanna play tag with dark brotherhood assassin, but to be frank, you dont really find better rpg spectacle than this game. ... unless you like challenge. then you go and buy dark souls, you bloody nwah.",1
"if you like shouting at people, you need this. also beats oblivion 100-0",1
"yet another great game to add to the elder scrolls series. elder scrolls v: skyrim is even more action packed than the previous games, with many features added. you can play anyway you want: assassin, mage, warrior, etc. have countless hours of fun with side quests, guilds, dlc, or the main story. i would highly recommed this game to anyone who enjoys rpgs or even if its your first one!",1
"10/10 use drugs, drink alot, steal all the time and shout with enough force to kill someone. my kind of game.",2
"greatest single player rpg game since oblivion!! the world is gorgeous and leaves the full feeling of self exploration and complete choose your own path experience. the vanilla game has some drawbacks compared to its previous titles. the removal of direct stat placement from morrowind still stings, and now the loss of the spell crafting table makes certain aspects of the game less customizable. overall with the overwhelming amount of user mods, some of which challenge professional content, can correct any shortcoming of the game and give you hundreds of additional game hours.",2
"probably one of the best rpgs ever made, with few drawbacks. a timeless open-world paradise.",1
"so much to do on this game. also looks way better than any console version by a million lightyears. turned on the xbox 360 version the other day and almost threw up. buy this.",1
"buy it, play it, mod the hell out of it. for the patient and technical ones, a delicious experience with a lot of variation, for those who just want to play, still a really good game. if youre looking for an adventure and spending time exploring, as usual, the elder scrolls has just what you need. although lacking the amazing atmosphere of its most highly regarded predecessor morrowind, the dazzling sights of skyrims mountainous northern landcape easily makes up for it. admittedly, skyrim does not exactly feel like a different world, like morrowind did, but rather more like an alternate past, which is a slight pity. playtime is, well, as long as you make it. again. mods. playstyle, i personally basically only play as a cloak and dagger character, as i find stealthing and sneak-attacking practically everyone oh so satisfying. just remember to quicksave before you try anything too dangerous. admittedly i could never get into any other playstyles, but seemingly there are those who enjoy other types as well. graphics, enb, find one you like, install, if your computer can handle it. audio, one of the weaker points i would say, but it does what it should, not too fond of the music or the sounds in general. in short, mod it. the game is far from perfect, but its bethesda, they only make flawed gems. i pun so hard.",2
"i used to play this on the xbox 360 but missed the dlc. i bought the legendary edition in summer sale 14 and i see it as a different game with better graphics and much more things to do. great game!!!",1
"back when fallout 3 came out i was amazed, when fallout: new vegas was released i was beyond amazed, so when bethesda finally released the next installment in the tes series i had to get some friends to help clean up the chunks of my mind off the floor. the detail and texture work is incredible and the story-telling is immence and full of twists and turns and keeps your hands glued to the keyboard and mouse. good job bethesda, you never seem to let us down. 9/10",1
"great game. full of bugs, yeah, but you can get an unoffical patch on nexus. also, as a standalone game, its awesome. but with mods, however, holy jezzuz cheese this is so amazing! *eyes roll out* edit #1: even without mods skyrim is a great game, let alone an elder scrolls game. considered by many to be the best, in my opinion, oblivion is a better elder scrolls entry story-wise. but, as a game alone, skyrim just beats oblivion. if you want a good game, get either this or oblivion. theyre both $20, unless you get the legendary edition of skyrim.",1
"this is a great game for those who like adventuring and murdering enemies such as trolls, wolfs, and thiefs. im mentioning thiefs becuase i nearly got robbed d:",1
"dragons, dragons, dragons. this game is brilliant, loads of stuff to do. tons of quest, tons of places to explore. a must buy for any fan of rpg games. get this and tesiv & tesiii, all brilliant games.",1
"fun and epic i have playng 130 hours plus and i still have things to do it the game.",1
"who needs family or friends when you can kill dragons! 10/10",1
"i took a break from gaming for the last decade. my last console was a gamecube. i bought skyrim on the recommendation of a friend (who hasnt left gaming for a decade), and holy freaking cow. its slightly better than a gamecube game. after 120 hours, to say my mind is officially blown is the understatement of the decade.",1
"love this game! highly recommended. i love the freedom you have in the game to do whatever you want and be whoever you want to be. sometimes its nice to just sit down and admire the beautiful graphics.",1
"the sheer immersiveness of the game coupled with the gajillion mods in the workshop will cause you unparalleled hours of replay",2
"as a long-time elder scrolls fan, i was very skeptical of skyrim at first. in fact, i didnt play it for 3 months after its release. oblivion was dumbed-down for consoles, and the pc version suffered for it. skyrim, on the other hand, is somewhere between morrowind and oblivion, despite still showing obvious signs of being a console port. its got a lot of content - you can spend hours just exploring, and that alone is great fun. the addition of dragons and shouts to the game is great, and taking a dragon down can be very satisfying. the main storyline is decent, and the various factions are fun as well, but thats not what youre here for. youre here to explore, discover, fight your way through hundreds of bandits and creatures, cave dive, dungeon crawl... all of it is endlessly entertaining. one last note - the modding community is very active, and that alone will keep me playing skyrim for a long time. if you get this game and dont mod it, youre missing out.",2
"this is a great game but not for the weak hearted if u are scared of spiders zombies trolls giant bugs you will not like this game also get the anilator bow mod",1
"if you havent already, buy this game!!! even at 15, skyrim is a masterpiece. the 3 dlc adds more hours to your over 100 hours of gameplay. plus modders never stop making content that improves the game further. this is what got me into rpg games. seriously, you have to buy this. its at a low price, but even better if you can pick it up during one of the steam sales. i cant express how great skyrim is. theres plenty of stuff to discover. just go and buy it already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"this is one of the best games i have played in my lifetime. and no, im not 11 years old... :p add 40 years to that. yes, 51. my life is extremely busy and video games have always been my number one activity to leave the standard world. the elder scrolls series of games has been one of the best sources of fun i have found and skyrim is simply the best one of the series by far! do download the dlc (downloadable contents) right away as the latest dlc (dragonborn) includes very potent aspects to the game as the ability to receive two perk points when reading ability books! but! yes, theres a but. the game is so vast that there are some bugs... you need to play this with the elder scrolls wiki",1
"rating: 9.5/10 this game is so old, but still its one of the best games that ive ever played. skyrim is one of the best rpgs that i have ever played in my whole life. its just like fallout 3, and fallout new vegas, but in a whole different universe with dragons, human sized lizards, and human sized cats that can talk! this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. the game is so perfect, but if you dont own or have even heard of skyrim, youre really missing out on a fantastic game. ive played threw this game so many times, and i still havent gotten bored of it.",1
"love this game! i have been playing since morrowind and it keeps getting better.",2
"not much left to be said about one of the most famous games of all time, other than that for all its flaws its still pretty brilliant and addicting. even before you add in mods. and a great many of skyrims flaws (a lack of interesting characters, some unbalance in skills at higher levels, various glitches/bugs, a lackluster selection of armor and weapons, etc.) have been fixed with aplomb by the modding community. this is a game about adventure and adventuring. about climbing that mountain you see in the distance just on a whim, and finding to your surprise a buried shrine to a forgotten spirit guarded by a cult of fanatics, or perhaps an outlaw lair whose chief has a rare, exotic weapon, or perhaps a power-granting word wall guarded by a dragon. its about finding treasures in every shadowed corner. about fighting dragons under a thunderstorm, of staying up all night to watch the sun rise from atop the tower of the house you just built with your own (digital) hands. it gives you freedom, but youll never lack for purpose. plus, it still looks gorgeous.",2
"tons to do in the game and when you are done with about half of it you will find mods you want to try out then it gos from 1 mod to 5 and then before you know 200+ mods i know because it happened to me",1
"this, so far, has been my personal favorite rpg. if you feel like this game is a little boring, there are mods for it in the workshop or at skyrimnexus to increase this games experience on how you play it. be careful on which mods you get, some mods may cause the game to crash if you dont have the dlc or if they are conflicting with other mods or have not been updated yet. and now elder scrolls online is on the way, i wonder what would the online version of this rpg be like.",2
"the most buggy piece of  game ever conceived by anyone and i love it 10/10",2
"this game is ok but quite hard. i am having fun when i play it but wonder why is it a 15 or 18 age game.",1
"skyrim is good a game enough, but combine with mods... it makes the game near infinite. get this game",1
"i love this game. only played a few hours on the pc so far but have it on the xbox and have played a few days! i cant believe there is so much in 6.8gb, a must for everyone",1
"a lengendary story, starts from an arrow in my knee, ends with death of a chicken ....... you can steal a man till naked 10/10",1
"waht more can be said about this game, its amazing. between the originl game and all of the mds out there. changing the gaame is as much fun as playing it.",3
"the elder scrolls series is a very fun series and skyrim helps prove that!",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim a rpg with a strong story and a fantastic set of controls. the story is pretty stright forward, the dragons (which have died out centurys ago) have came back from the dead lead by the world eater allduin and the dragons are attacking the the province of skyrim, and the dragonborn has returned. the game is good, but there are minor glitches that are small so they dont make a big difference to the game but its still good. wade. :)",1
"skyrim. years later and many charaters later, i still play this great game. sure the story is boring, and the two primary quest structures are terrible. sure the dialouge isnt very good. sure there were numorus glitches. its still a great, open-world game. i still throughly enjoy clearing out dungeons, killing monsters, stealing money, helping the common folk, bare knuckle brawling in pubs, and the tons of other activities this game has to offer. every new character is an adventure, and many times ill find something new about the game, even after so many years. i highly recommend this game. this is a truely great game.",1
"who wouldnt reccomend this game? get this game. or else.",1
"buy a house, download children mod, collect them in your house. commence roleplay.",1
"dear god how i love this game... i now know why my friends are so addicted to this game and why i hardly never see them on anything else, this game is amazing, i have to set my graphics to low but even then, the graphics are incredible. i cant wait to get my gaming pc in the next few years and ramp this to the highest settings. a must buy 11/10",1
"how to describe this game...the width of an ocean but the depth of a puddle",1
"what the hell this game is really fun and basically perfect and even when its not perfect just go download a mod and its like boom now its perfect. im in the top 1% of all players according to raptr which is a very valid source so you should listen to me",2
"you know what? this is pretty much the best game ive ever played. i mean it. this is the best game i have ever played. this is much more of an epic, living, breathing world than oblivions. you will play for hours on end not even realising the time that has passed. i have played for 17 hours and have only got halfway through the main quest and i havent even chosen a side for the civil war that is the buzz of skyrim. there are still so many quests to do in my journal, and yet i keep getting newer ones from guilds, each better than the last. i havent even explored most of the world, and i have still found some amazing scenery, dungeons and towns. and heres another thing i forgot to mention properly. dragons. these things are huge and can attack towns at random what with their brilliant ai. when you go over to help the town defend themselves, you only feel like more of a hero. seriously. buy. this. game.",1
"bought it because of the summer sale and all the good comments everyone would make about this game. so far, im really excited and glad about this purchase. the game is somewhat serious, but really fun, and even under low graphics config it looks good. i recommend it for the rpg lovers.",1
"great game! i have this game for both the xbox 360 and the pc, and i would highly recomend it for pc. you can get so much more ou tof it with mods and such. plus the overall experience is much better and the game is more immersive.",1
"adventure abound and excellent mods! weeks of fun to be had! :d",1
"this game is an excellent portrayal of what bethesda softworks is capable of. combining a massive amount of quests with an open world, there is plenty to keep you playing the elder scrolls v for hours on end. plus, its cheaper now and the legendary edition is a great buy, containing every single dlc.",1
"dis game iz da b3stest. it iz wun uf me fav fall0ut geymz. eh lyk wen da dragun kumz fear on yur fase. i sp3bt naby knights playin dis",1
"ive spent more hours playing this, and other bethesda games, than i have playing any other game. the modding community is great, and despite a few minor issues, this may be one of the best games of all time. 10/10",3
"one of the greatest games i have ever played. 10/10 -stonefist mcgee",1
"i walked into whiterun and found 2 blonde nude ladies, so i killed them and sacrificied them to the gods.",1
"i personally loved this game. its very expansive and youll never run out of things to do, find, and kill. if you use mods your gonna get on at christmas and get off at christmas the following year! so, yes i very much love this game.",1
"its like sex, great for the first 2000 hours, then never again...",1
"this is quite a good game, you can do missions try to fight the whiterun guard and level up (if you win). you can also add mods. 10/10",1
"this game is absolutely amazing, not just for what it is, but for how much bethesda left the doors open for modding. playing this on pc is such a different expeience from playing on the ps3 or xbox 360, that it litterally is an entirely different game. every time i find myself beginning to get bored with it, i just look for new and different mods to change it up a bit, and im pulled right back into it again :)",2
"gnarly. mod until it crashes and then mod some more.",1
"pretty damn good game, play through once though and havent pick it up again.",1
"i love this game so much, its really fun to see what kind of mods people make as well, so yeah, if you dont like skyrim we cant be friends.",1
"just a really bad rpg,  story,  characters, dull combat and one of the worst worlds ever nothing really fantasy based, even the dragons are  pros - a lot to do - bows are cool to use - nice crafting - mods cons - combat, wait then attack crap - the world is just hills and trees nothing really interesting - story, dragons are coming back...... they are zombie dragons -_- - characters, cardbored cut outs - not epic in any way - super easy, like omg if you want a good tes game, play morrowind if you want a good rpg , play dark souls",1
"wow. such shout! so many dragon. much explore. why fus ro dah? amaze dragonborn. much time sink. wow.",1
"i havent played many rpgs but skyrim is one of the best! the bad things are: graphics story (sometimes) and some boring quests but most of the time the game is exceeptional!!! 9/10",1
"i cant even write how awesome this game is, just read the other reviews, and read all the gaming articles about it. do yourself a favor and download the highly rated graphics mods for this. and after you complete the game, you can download conversions or make a new game with certain war related mods enabled. youll love this game, this game is up there on my list alongside the mass effect and assassins creed series as well as kotor.",1
"the combat and animation are crap, but its fun exploring the open world. btw, i have already achieved chim.",1
"i once shouted at a giant and sent it to the moon. 11/10",3
"fantastic game. whether you mod it, or go through it without mods, youre bound to have lots of fun hours playing this massive game.",1
"this game is amazingly fun to to play and the replayability is endless. from the questlines to the character builds and skill usages its going to take you quite awhile to finish playing it. i would heavily recommend this game because even once you finish the game mods can extend its life and add to the experience as well. this is most definately a game worth its money and i hope you guys have as much fun as i had playing this game!",1
"pretty great action rpg. definitely one of those everyone should play at least once. hundreds of hours of gameplay with the core game alone. i really like the hearthfire addon as having my own custom, large home is a relief due to all of the loot i have amassed!",1
"really great game love it better on pc then a system thanx to mods",1
"one of the best games ive ever played and the workshop keeps the game feeling new!!",1
"i got this first on the 360. to be quite honest, this game can be real engrossing depending on how you play it. at first, it felt empty to me once i finished the main storyline back on 360, but now that im playing it again on pc, starting fresh, im absorbed by it like when i first played it on 360. this is one of the sp rpgs out there thatll take up a lot of your time.",1
"this game is great if you wanna emerse your self in temrela to be exact the contenent of skyrim where you are a dragon born of ether nord imperial kajheet argoniona dark elf high elf or many add ons threw the work shop if you wanna stay with the lore add lore friendly mods well thats about all i can say just look at my hours and know ive barley started the story line its up to you to buy it now and save skyrim and be the dragon born",1
"this game is excellent, its so addicting. the gameplay is pretty much endless, and the huge world you can explore is just awesome. a bad part about it is, it needs really good graphics, or else its really slow and is frustrating to play. so if you have a good graphics card, i strongly suggest you buy it.",1
"i had completed every quest and side quest on my playstation years ago, then i sold it. with the introduction of the new dlc, bethesda practically forced me to buy it on the pc. if you havent played skyrim yet, you cant go wrong for 5,00 (price on sale). its a marvel.",1
"bought and finished it on xbox an year ago, bought it again because modsmodsmodsmods. oh and yeah its a pretty good game.",1
"just a fantastic game from the story to the gameplay. mods also add to the fun, so buy my very expensive tf2 crates",1
"amazing game! using mods with this is insanely fun!",1
"one of the greatest games to come out of bethesda. i have spent way over 100 hours on this game and have not even completed it yet with mods from the community, this extends the life of the game even further",1
"a solid open world game, let down by its poor combat and story. if you are looking for a game ot mod though, this game checks that box.",1
"nothing is better than an elder scrolls game. and skyrim is better than anything you could imagine. dragons, civil war and vampires and just a few things that your character will go through in his crazy life. honestly though, is anyones life really that cool?",1
"amazing game, the level of freedom is simply astounding.",1
"this is the best rpg..... ive played in my entire life so far...... and ive played alot of them..... also beware fools for this game is so addictive and so hard. u will die at least once and laugh a few times and i will say only one bad thing about this game. you dont paid enough for doing what u do. also there is no mission where u dont beat up or kill people or animals or creatures , etc. in this game so be prepared to fight off armys. cause u will... lets do this men and women!!!!",2
"even tho i played only 20 hours on pc (i played it back then on my xbox 360) i must say its the best rpg in the whole universe of great rpgs!",1
"buy this game and let it consume your life, forget friends, food, toilet ect., play this game and/or die!",2
"no wonder why this won the game of the year, it is beautiful, really. inmersive gameplay, tons of story and quests, easily a 200+ hours game. the dlc is great also adds new places, npcs, weapons, etc... the legendary edition is a must. and finally the mods... thank god pc gaming. the community really makes it possible to play with almost anything you want. want more variety of weapons? are you bored of the same npcs or same weather all the time? want more inmersive mechanics like hunger, thirst and hypothermia effects? want more impressive spells? want to add ponies instead of dragons!? you got all of this and more!!! lots and lots of replayability!!! just browse through nexus or steam workshop and add all you like. you will have a blast with this game.",1
"you can download a mod that adds a laugh track every time you die.",1
"simply the best single player rpg that ive played to date...",3
"if you needed another recommendation in order to go buy skyrim, heres one: the elder scrolls series of games are the best fantasy roleplaying games on the market. period. the free-form nature of play, the deep and fleshed-out lore, the top-tier graphics, skyrim is a fitting continuation of the elder scrolls legacy. its a game you can sink more hours than would seem possible into.",1
"massive open world, lots of content, loads of mods due to the developers going out of their way to make sure modders have the tools they need. totally recommended by me and im sure youll invest hundreds of hours into this game especially with mods.",1
"if it hasnt crashed yet, install more mods. thats how i play this game, yet i have spent more than half my time playing this game trying to troubleshoot it. 9/10, could have more hair options in character creator.",1
"i love this game. i have spent 100s of hours playing (prior to the dlc) and have yet to see all of this majestic world. plus the bonus of having so many excellent mods makes the experience even better!",2
"love this game, it can be heavily modded and it has some amazing gameplay. get this on sale and you wont regret it!",1
"this game is the reason i built a gaming pc. 10/10- would try to add enough mods to kill paarthurnax again",1
"if you like the elder scrolls series you will love the new upgrades. plus mod support this game is epic. obviously you need to have the expansions for full experiance and modding is definately recommended",1
"i got a lot of hours out of skyrim. its simple fun that has a lot of content. unfortunately, looking back on it, it was ultimately somewhat of a let down. you are presented with an ocean of possibility, but in reality this ocean is barely a foot deep. the combat is shallow and clunky. mods give the game more playability, but the base game is unsatisfying if youre looking for something more.",1
"there are a couple of glitches in the game, some fatal, so you might need to save often, but that is a small price to pay. if your looking for a good game to play, definatly play this one.",1
"a game of pure epicness. check it out if u havent played it already.",1
"one of the best games of this generation made better with mod and workshop support. an excellent purchase no matter what the price.",1
"absolutely epiuc game. with the freedom to act as you see fit and an amazing world to play in, even if you dont like rpgs at least try this one.",2
"game of the year 2011! i dont think there is anything else that needs to be said.",1
"i cant remember the main storyline all i remember are chicks with huge t*ts lightsabers and gandalf firing nukes. then it was supposed to be about dragons. right?",1
"if you love extended gameplay, this is game for you! maybe main plot is not too long, but large number of secondary tasks makes this game a good choice for play!",1
"one of the best games on steam.it has everything you need in a quality game:good graphics,modding,a complicated storyline,characters you cant forget and so many playstile options",2
"at its core, skyrim is a fairly solid game - rather a lot of bugs, to be sure, but still an enjoyable experience. more than six or so voice actors would have been nice, as its rather weird running into, for example, shopkeepers that have the same voice as a quest-lines primary antagonist (though i would like nazeem more if he had alduins voice). where the game really shines, though, is the modding community - most problems that you can think of in the game have been either fixed or bizarrely exaggerated by a mod thats out there, somewhere, and thats without going into the handful of mods that add things with tommy wiseaus voice.",3
"if you play anything other than a khajiit, you arent playing it right, man.",1
"great game for wasting time would roar again 10/10",1
"the elder scrolls series are some of the best games of all times, not only for gaming content but for the massive amount of lore provided by the developers as well as the gaming community. check out the trailers for the morroblivion mods!",2
"the only game where i spent around 6 months in my room beating up wolves with my bare hands. everyone loves me now.",1
"if you like first person rpgs, or rpgs in general, get this. if you like the other elder scrolls games, get this. even if you didnt, get this. i guess what im saying is get this game. now. do it.",3
"best game in the history of games that allow you to divert from the main story. all i want to do is hunt and go treasure hunting.",2
"okay game. i guess i could recommend it. definitely not popular anymore (as if it was popular when it first released.....) i would say its on par with warz. 7.5/10 too much rpg",1
"pretty well known game, latest entry in the elder scrolls. lots of bugs have been patched up and some new features added, which makes it fun. gameplay is good, but the graphics are lackluster given the time period it was released in. by itself, a good game. with the dlc, a better game. with mods, an absolutely great game.",1
"the moment you felt like wanting to ruin your life is when you bought this",1
"one of the best role playing games so far. with several hours of gameplay quests, sweet graphics and environment. an open world rpg that will get you to a whole new level of gameplay and experience. the dawnguard dlc is quite good and fun to play which adds more than 10 hours of extra gameplay along with the additional side-quests and definitely with a replay value. while the dragonborn dlc is a must-have, with new weapons, enemies, dragon shouts, armors, and of course an excellent side-story quest taking place in solstheim.",1
"this game is so awesome, i not only bought it for my xbox, but on steam too just so i could always play it.",1
"pc elitists rejoice. its an elder scrolls game. nude mods fall from the heavens and blanket the earth with beautiful imagery. console commands! 1000 whees of cheese? done. attack them with your modded lightsabers? pc gamers plz. childs play. i used to be an adventurer like dovahkiin then i became a pc  and bought this game. 10/10. graffics.",1
"this game never ends. in most games, that wouldnt be a very complimentary feature, but in this game the gameplay is phenomenal, the graphics are great, the level system is smooth, and you can do almost whatever you want. it has hours upon hours of playability, with the main story line, the dlc story lines, the playermade dlcs on the workshop, and then on top of that, every playthrough can be different because of the vast collection of player made mods. plus it was only $7.50 during the christmas sale. i would recommend this game to anyone.",1
"5 days after buying it, i got 100 hours in it. mods are love, mods are life.",4
"totaly awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"i do recommend this game its epic become a nord then youll be the lord of the next horde become an orc and you will look like a dork holding a fork become an argonian they really like onions become a thief you can even rob hefid the deaf become a vampire you will rule their empire so thats some functions of the game...",1
"if you have not played this game yet, you need to. it is pretty amazing the amount of time you can spend in it and still find  to do. the community mods make it even more enoyable.",1
"got clubbed by a giant and was launched into orbit. 10/10 would orbit again.",1
"one of the best open-world games available at the momment. if you are dedicated, say goodbye to 400-500 hours on this baby, and you still wont finish everything!",1
"well, after sinking in a couple of hours i must say. modding is great omg i love the fact that we can just mod away. i dont even believe i have any core aspect left. 11/10 would mod again.",1
"skyrim is a blockbuster rpg based in the elder scrolls universe that straight up delivers. when i consider games that have some aspect of choosing sides and decision making that effects the story there are few games that i will play that i come to the point of saying to myself ,im not going to kill this particular character! thats wrong and would alter this world in an bad way. the world is immense and can be overwhelming to new elder scrolls players like myself, but fret not, the excellent voice-acting and storylines help you to blend into the world with ease. am i a nord soldier fighting for the independence of skyrim or an actual person? i dont remember anymore.",1
"i see trees of white, white snow too. i see snow fall, for me and you. and i think to myself, what a boring world.",1
"easily the best 80 hours ive ever wasted in a game. updated: and now, 120 hours. how time flies when youre having fun with mods.",1
"why the f*** doesnt it work on windows 8.1 .... i wasted 15 and it only worked once and now all it does is crashes",1
"bethesda has done it again with an incredible open world game. skyrim has become one of my all time favorite games. i still find myself coming back and creating a new character over and over to experience this rich world. add all the dlc and the vast amounts of great mods, this game is a must have!",1
"one of the most fun, entertaining and adictive rpg games of all time. brilliant game for rpg players and people who like magic.",1
"skyrim is a fantastic game, one of my absolute favorite games of all time, its beautiful, moddable, challenging, open world amazing, if i made a lengthy review, all the text could be translated into a very simple picture of me giving bethesda fellatio and enjoying it..... no homo, the game is simply that good.",2
"the best rpg that ive played and also led me into the rest of the series. i have over 30 hours palyed on pc but i also have over 300 hours on xbox.",1
"no word to describe this game so i will say awseome but some monsters scare me (giant spiders) but worth every penny",1
"first, the biggest disappointment is the ui. i dont understand, why many desktop softwares including oses mimic mobile/console ui today. it is really inconvinient and feels restricted with keyboard/mouse. second, i see many graphics improvements, but the core parts remains more or less the same as elder scroll 4 : oblivion. third, the quest marker ruins the game. you dont need to think about what you are doing, or even you dont need to read or hear the talks. just follow the marker, thats all. i felt im not playing the game, but testing the scripts. but then, you could say why dont you turn off the quest marker? i tried, but i think the devs assume that most users are using quest marker, so you have often (very) insufficient information about whats next. its like there are only the difficulty levels, very easy and very hard. forth, you cannot feel that your char is stronger/weaker than others, because there is an option to choose combat difficulty level and no absolute standard. the same opponent can be very challenging or too easy. its all up to the option and not your char. dont get me wrong. i think es 5 : skyrim is a great game. but when i see skyrim as an upgrade of oblivion, there are not much improvements except for graphics.",1
"great for sinking time for those who like to get lost in little things like chasing a fox only to see a butterfly youd want to catch which makes you take notice of a path that leads to a cave which is filled with a grotto that lets in light that shines down on a single tree which happens to have two bears guarding a treasure chest. on top of all that, being able to mod it makes it so you can do all that in 4k resolutions.",2
"immersive single player gameplay with stunning graphics and a sandbox environment, skyrim is a perfect evolution of the elder scrolls gameline.",2
"this is a fantastic game, add in the workshop and youve got infinite replayability.",2
"ing 10/10 would waste 3 years of my life playing, oh wait i already did. worth it!",1
"this game has me addicted. have been playing for an age but doesnt get boring at all.",2
"if you havent played this yet, what the hell are you waiting for???!!! hundreds of hours of content, mix and match any class you want to suit your play style, beautiful scenery, epic story lines and more lore than you can have a nerdgasm at. counting my non-steam copy of the game i have about 450 hours of skyrim under my belt and im still finding things i havent done or didnt know about and after youve exhausted the vanilla version....mod it till it crashes!!!! seriously check out nexusmods, theres some crazy  on there, graphics overhauls, new locations, weapons, armor, characters and more. this game will never die, you will never run out of new things to do and the modding community is very active. get it.",1
"as vast as an ocean but deep as a puddle. if youre into modding, buy it. if youre into rpg games, buy dragon age: inquisition.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim, so much to say about this game. i will try to keep it short.  = poor  = fair  = good  = nice  = awesome  = amazing  this game is without a doubt the best, and i mean, the best game i have ever played. in all its beauty, skyrim brings you all your heart could possibly desire. you can practically be anything you want and the options are endless. customize your characher like there is no tomorrow. if you want to explore, this is the game. if you want to fight endless ammounts of bad guys and monsters, this is the game. if you want a variety of different combat styles, this is the game. you get to do all that in the most beautiful universe, and i assure you, that you will play no other game that has the same extrodinary nature like skyrim. even if you arent the biggest fan of singleplayerbased games, this game will catch your attention right away. this is a true beauty. ing fantastic!",1
"what can you say? it will always be one of those games you can go back to and play again!",1
"this game... this franchise... this company... flawless.",1
"i have over 200 mods installed and still cant roleplay my character correctly. 10/10",2
"its pretty fun. i only bought this game on pc because of the mods. so many wonderful mods. id also recommend all three dlcs because theyre awesome.",1
"you will love this game! a leveling system that is similar to fallout 3, complete immersion of lore and land, characters are incredibly diverse, and the entire game is so big youll spend weeks playing it! combat is the only flaw...ish. its insanely fun but repetative. and of course the fabled bethesda glitches... if you count them as bad. personaly, i find the glitches hilarious. if you havent already, buy it... now!",1
"these are the following step i did when i first started skyrim step 1 : kill a chicken step 2 : whole village hated me step 3 : tries to kill them step 4 : killled them but they wont  die step 5 : restart skyrim 10/10 would never kill a chicken in my life again.",1
"steam summer sale. this was my first purchase. i had been wanting this for some time but never found it in a price within what i purchase for myself. my family members that wanted it have had it for awhile now. it has card drops!!! i played it a bit longer than it took to get the card drops and initially i can see what all the fuss is about. it looks like this is a very good game. i was enjoying the fact that the wilderness reminded me of times in rl when i have tromped through the wilderness (many times). i am excited to get in and play this again when i am not distracted by trying to sell card drops so i can buy more games with wallet cash. :)",1
"thiis one of the best games i have ever played in my life it has a thrilling sotry and many other great features, definatly a 10/10 anyone who loves role play games and aventure, this is the game for you",1
"its amazing when you dont have mods because its more legit and i do kinda like it with mods but not that much",1
"awesome game would recommend that everyone plays this at least once!",1
"got lost,again,for the fourth time,in only one region.welp,8 more regions.",1
"i use to review games, but then i took an arrow to the knee.",1
"a true masterpiece! if you like rpg, you love this. must have for every true fan!",1
"if exploring is your thing, then youll like this game. create a multitude of different characters and take them out to explore the world. contains many genuinely interesting quests and stories. i highly recommend playing for the story, and not the difficulty as the game itself is very easy (although you may die occassionaly to the unexpected ultra strong guy). combat is very basic, but welcome in a story driven game. if you dont plan on reading the dialogue, then i recommend you stay away. about the only things i didnt like was the leveling system. overall id say it was great, but as an exploration game, i wanted to keep improving my character through lockpicking or armor or whwatever. however you need to focus where you level stuff up much as there is a level cap. fortunately this can be remedied with the abundant amount of player created mods that are fast and easy to install. and if you love the leveling system but dont like the crafting system? there is a mod for that too. 10/10",2
"the newest release of the elder scrolls series, skyrim brings excellent graphics and polished gameplay to the forefront of this wonderful new rpg release. like all of bethesdas giant, open-world rpgs there are plenty of bugs to wade through (and have fun with!) and youll definitely sink way too many hours into this game. its fun on a whole new level - bethesda is the best at this type of game and theyve done an unparalleled job once again. pros: good gameplay beautiful graphics enormous world to explore mod support immersive cons: still not as good as morrowind was if you like bethesda rpgs, have enjoyed any of the previous elder scrolls games, or just love fantasy, pick up skyrim - youll love it. the immersion is top-notch and youll wander the endless mountains of the beautiful countryside for hours on end, truly believing you are the dovakiin. i still preferred morrowind more; however, the graphics and beauty of this game cannot be beat by any of its competitors. a+",1
"one of my top top 5 favorite games, if you havent played skyrim your missing out on such a great rpg. i would definitley recommend this to anyone! :d 10 out of 10 with so much open world to explore the game is almost endless (besides the main campaign of course). :d",1
"the game is amazing, fun and addictive. could have been better if there wasnt spiders in the begining because of how popular aracnophobia is these days. i literally had to squint my eyes to finish the first part.",1
"honestly, im having the time of my life playing this.",2
"this is the best bethesda rpg thus far. it offers terrific gameplay mechanics, numerous stories relatively seamlessly presented in a sandbox that does a great job of balancing sufficient player choices to be empowering with enough direction to avoid feeling aimless. this is easily one of the best games ive played in the last several years.",1

"really good game. havent even downloaded any of the content from the workshop and i already spent over 75 hours on this game. just a huge sandbox for you to play in. ive played oblivion on my xbox360 console and i have to say that this game is much better. just the graphics, combat and overall experience. i have very high expectations for the next elder scrolls game.",1
"best elder scrolls game ever!!!! for a very good change of look i recommend the followings mods (for female character): apachii sky hair, caliente female body mod bbe, sg textures cbbe, akiller keos skimpy cbbe armor... *no cheat*",1

"awesome game...love the content creator kit too...",2
"problems when moving to a new home that you just purchase and you have a lot of metal/ore that needs to be moved to your new home, and it weighs a ton or more that causes encumbrance in which made you cant run. no problem, just ride any horse. because their thighs are strong enough to support the weight of a thousand elephants and can still sprint across the map. best logic. 10/10 best game ever.",1
"good game for people that like long lasting adventures, even after you beat the main story.",4
"i didnt think much of the game when my cousin got it on console. i popped the disk in since i had it. then 4 hours went by. 200+ hours later, i have a pc copy. 194 hours later, i write this review.",2

"even with some bugs in game, its still enjoyable :d",1
"if you like open world games, and dont like going outside, seeing your friends/family, being productive, etc. then get this game. you will get lost in it. to me there are 2 main story lines, 4 guild/groups, hundreds of quests, crafting, housing. so much to do! i highly recommend this if for some reason youve never played it.",1
"ive been disapponted with bethesda games such as fallout 3, new vegas and the oblivion title. this however is a completely different ball game. totally immersive, ingenious design, a plethora of modicfications available for free, and a gripping and tasking storyline.",1

"day #284 legend speaks of a thing called sunlight. clearly a legend from a bygone era. i have only known this dark abyss and the faint flicker of a lcd monitor... ...i have... visions, dreams,.... perhaps memories of others. i think they were called people. no, no, no, no, there is only skyrim, there has only ever been skyrim. (its pretty good with mods, muddy console port garbage without. still not as good as morrowind.)",4
"the best game ive played in awhile. just alot of fighting and in your own way, either with swords and bows, or magic and swords! how cool is that?!?",1
"holy  my waifu is better than yours buy this game and fite me irl scrub say that to my face and not in windhelm.",1
"skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played. i highly recommend it for people that like action, adventure based games. it has nice graphics and there is thousands of mods, texturepacks and things like that out there that can make the game special for you. buy this incredibly awesome game, you won`t regret it! i promise!",1
"this game earned goty for a reason, you can literally spend 100+ hours and still be entertained with plenty of quests and items to get. the world is vast, the dungeons numerous and plenty of monsters and creatures to interact with. more so i recommend getting all the dlc, they are worth every cent.",1

"addictive? yes. this new high can be taken in many forms, and will rarely get boring. you want to be a barbaran? happily. you want to be a alchemist? brilliant. you want to be a mage-assassin? hail sithis! and, for the best highs, youll want the legendary version. in case youre after shiny new things to add to your addiction, i would suggest checking out nexus mods (and their nifty manager), or the steam workshop. for help with your skyrim addiction, pop over to the forums and the workshop, where lots of people share the same addiction... and will happily help you find the best addiction mode for you. (no suprise arrows in the knee, promise.)",5
"best game ever, hands down. takes all the best aspects of the series and jams it into one action packed part of a huge, amazing picture. highly recommend this game. seriously.",1
"well, what can i say? its an elder scrolls! best games ever in terms of mods, i tried some, and the ui mod is completely necessary to play this game. caution: it can ruin your life!",1
"soooo much fun! i really reccommend this game to annyone who is thinking about it. this is a great game soely judged by its superb graphics, but throw in an epic rpg with first and third person aspects, well, you can guess where im going with this. 9.8/10 ~dale",1
"skyrim is the best game ever it has everything you could as for. i especially love getting mods for my game from the steam workshop",1
"buy this game right now, but use mods. mods can make this game amazing and very immersive, much more so than the vanilla version. why play skyrim when you can live in skyrim?",1
"this game is just beautiful. fun, engrossing and incredibly deep. be prepared to spend some serious time on this! its worth every second though. a+",1
"awesome, just awesome. besides baldurs gate and deus ex this is the best game ever made imo. extremely atmospheric, epic combat and ic dragons. panoramic exploration, oldschool dungeon crawling and improved gameplay. - dual wield lightning a la star wars emperor. - summon heavy storms that cover the entire battlefield. - and finishing moves a la dark messiah. recommended to a broad variety of gamers.",1
"the elder scrolls: theres snow in it now is an epic and game-changing racing horror beat-em-up fighting sports roguelike strategic fps free-to-play indie mmo that mixes intense action with intense more action from the makers of the critically acclaimed action 52. arriving in 1998 to a wide and demanding audience, it stunned its fans and critics alike with its revolutionary vats targeting system and huge, expanding story involving terrorists, more terrorists, counter-terrorists, a man named handsome jack, tons of hats, and that guy with the hat who made minecraft. players take on the role of harry mason as he unravels a secret plot by the umbrella corp to infect black mesa with a disease that makes things into hats, and you must race against the clock to deliver the antidote to the great deku tree or else the world will fall under the control of saxton hale, the famed maker of the metal gear solid franchise. using all the guns, bows, sticks, cats, and hats at your fingertips, you must guard your airship from a wide variety of enemies including bandits, bandits, bandits, zombies, bandits with sticks, and bandits with axes. i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the touhou franchise or wants to give the struggling developer, ea, some money to finance more of their incredible walking dead games.",1
"dlcs are the best! so someone need to buy them for me, thanks!",1
"i cant even begin to explain how much i love this game. its litterally like a second life to me, and with mods it becomes 600% better.",2
"you will have to spend dozens of hours to fully explore skyrim. like any other bethesda game, it has its share of imperfections and broken promises, but its exciting and fascinating nevertheless. im enjoying 99% of the time im playing it. :)",1
"definately the most beautiful rpg ive ever played, amazing graphics, and extensive voice-work make it an audio and visual buffet. decent storyline(s) and a plethora of interesting freeform side quest chains to pick and choose from at ones leisure. the what u do is what u level character/skill building mechanic that weve come to expect in the elder scrolls series works nicely in skyrim, as it always has. did have a few gripes though, the tailored enemy environment* means that gameplay gets a bit repetetive after a while. also, stealth and archery just made the game easy mode, if thats the only character youve played, you havent challenged yourself as much as is available in skyrim ;) *gaming lingo meaning that the wherever you go, the mobs are scaled to be an apropriate level relative to yours, as opposed to status quo where the mobs are the level they are, wherever they happen to be, they are not affected by the level of the pc.",1
"well i got to start reveiwing at some point the game may be a few years old but it is still fun to play the exploring a huge facter is the mods the modding community has really kept this game alive it makes every thing from bunny follower to just funny swords like a giant popsical it has apsects of a mmo like the role playing mounted combat the freedom you have getting married oh then getting divorced freedom right? xd crafting is fun even better with mods when you can crafy stuff like spartan armour assasins creed armour, even a darth vader helmet the game is endless of what you can do if you put your mind to it like i even a pregnant npc mod o_o as i said it is endless in what you can do :)",1
"one of the best games in existance!!!! there are a million things to do and if thats not enough for you there are so many mods, you will never get bored!!!",1
"a fun, if unchallengeing vanilla experience, mods highley recomended to keep the game fresh.",2
"if you like open world games of any kind and you think slaying dragons and being a total badass is fun, then this is the game for you, if your system can handle it. the only bad things are fetch quests, minor bugs (that can be really funny), and sometimes annoying characters.",1
"if youre thinking of buying this game, dont think, just buy the game. 11/10",3
"the very best single-player experience of this year and probably the next!",1
"when i first played this game i was playing on a friends copy. i must have probably sunk hundreds of hours into this game and even after i completed it i got a copy of my own to replay! admittedly, this game has its bugs and quirks, but its strong modding community, expansions and highly intuitive controls for a rpg game are more than enough to own a copy yourself regardless whatever flavor of game suits your tastes.",1
"best played on higher difficulties this game takes many modern elements of rpg and smashes them into one. with an awesome modding community this game is to be consedered one of the best pc games of all time!",1
"my favorite game of all time. this game really throws you in a world where you can be what you want to be.",1
"no gnu/linux support. mods via steam workshop are heavily censored. sidequests are very boring. story is over with too quickly. visuals are alright. id play it a bit more and post a fuller review if it was playable on an os that respects my freedom.",1
"what other game lets you see a cave bear kick the  out of a dragon. exactly.",1
"the thing about skyrim that makes it special is its ability to help you lose yourself, it is very immersive and has alot more to it then it seems at first glance. the leveling system is spot on although the character creation is a bit lacking unless you download a few mods. all i can really say is i love this game, its taken me on adventures that i wont soon forget.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a great game for anybody who enjoys rpgs. it has vertually limetless character options and a lot of replay value, seriously, you can play this game countless times and never get bored of its many storylines. if you get this game, be sure to check out the workshop for even more hours of enjoyment with mods.",1
"the skyrim is a move that you have to pay twenty dollars for down by the docks. i paid fifty for this but it was also pretty good.",1
"you must play this game! it is the best game in the world! hundreds of hours of awesome and exiting and extreme boss game play! get this game!",1
"this is a great game to get worth every penny...the mods are hilarious and the graphics are great id recomend buying all the dlc as it adds alot to the game including making a house and riding dragons",1
"pros -good story -fun quests -cool graphics -good weapons -thirdperson -cloths -armor -customizable charaters -mods cons -no multiplayer -bugs",1
"play skyrim......create your skyrim...live the fantasy,",2
"amazing game !!!! i origionally bought for xbox and liked it but it was missing something , mods and commands . this makes the game way more enjoyable i have recommend you too buy this game and ive played days and days on xbox and just bought the summer sale #skyrim",1
"magnificent. one of the best games i have ever played. 10/10",1
"cabbages. chickens. yelling at people to kill them. 10/10",1
"this game is awesome. be all you can be style of play. xd and it has dragons. lots of dragons. no other game can beat that.",3
"this game, in my experience, is bethesdas best. the storytelling is rich, the world is giagantic and open, the side quests are interesting and challenging, and the dlcs are well worth buying. ive not played this game for the hundreds of hours other people have played it, but if you put in the time ive putt in modding it, youd probably find me at around a hundred. very high recommendation. 10/10",1
"guards of a castle told me not to go into the abandoned wing because it was haunted. went anyways. ended up being forced to help the daedric prince of madness and got a hipbone as a reward for freeing him to ravage the world. 10/10 would help pelagius again",1
"i used to think that first-person roleplaying games were lame and boring. then, i played skyrim!!",1
"really fun, really open. the only thing i wasnt too happy about was the good/bad split wasnt always right. every action was a little bit good and a little bit bad in weird ways, and it always felt like there should be other options that the game simply didnt even acknowledge. there was no option to buy out the assassins guild to take out the blackbriars and liberate riften, or reach the top of the thieves guild, and use that to curb their excesses and teach them not to s%@1 where they eat. the game, vanilla, is still like hundreds of hours of awesome fun, and then the steam workshop makes it easy to add hundreds more.",1
"great game huge moding community what else is there to say",2
"this is crap i play all tipes of games and love skyrim on the playstation and it is good on the x-box, but the pc version blows and is laggy this game has been out long enof that bugs like this should have been fixed by now you guys need to step up the up dates.",5
"great game sneaking is amazing, its fun leveling up all my skills.",1
"its a nice, flexible open-world rpg game. you can basically just run around and do whichever quests you please. the exclusion of classes is an interesting choice and may appeal to some and be unappealing to others. pros: -open world with a lot to do. -quests can have more variety than other rpg games. -mods for gameplay tweaking and extra content. -dragons can be a fun challenge to fight. -level and world design is good, although some improvements could have been made. cons: -almost non-existent difficulty curve. no matter what level you are(until very high levels), you will run into enemies far too weak and far too strong for you. the latter is more problematic when going through a place with a ton of somewhat weak enemies and suddenly running into an enemy that can kill you in 2-3 hits. -feels limited by its own engine. -somewhat shallow combat. all in all, its a pretty good game. its far from perfect, but it should keep almost any fantasy game fan occupied for some time.",2
"my favorite rpg game ever created. in my opinion, it is a huge step up from oblivion. leveling is smoother, combat is much more realistic and varied, and there are just so many things that skyrim adds to the game that were missing in prevous games. this game also has my favorite graphics out of any game i have seen, which isnt bad for a game that is around 2 years old now. i highly recommend this game if you are a fan of the previous elder scrolls games, or just enjoy medieval type rpgs in general. bethesda did not dissapoint and their reputation for creating great quality games still stands.",1
"i absolutely love this game. let me begin by saying ive wasted days of my life, literally days, playing this game. for about a year i remained offline, and ive accumulated many more hours than are shown -- perhaps 30 or more hours a week for about a year or so. this game is beautiful, and vast. there are so many things to do, places to explore, quests to complete -- and then some, with all the mods available. each time you play, there is a different experience. this game has been out for a few years now, but it is just as rich and full as when it was released. i dont think ill ever tire of this game.",1
"this game is really good until you play it for 200+ hours. played it on ps3 a ton.",1
"its a amazing adventure game, the quests are good i havent got bored of it so much to do!",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",1
"very good once you start it kinda sucks you in the same with its predecessors. when you begin the main quest line its quite easy to get distracted and run into a dragon or giant then you will most likely accidently discover a new location which means even more exploring. as usual the game was not without its fair share of problems and it is bethesda were talking about who love to realease a game full of bugs that does get patched later on. i would say however from somone who put in 500+hours into oblivion this new edition to the elder scrolls saga seems a little less clunky there are some things missing that i would have loved to have seen make a reappearance such as the spell creator which leads me onto the fact that the spells are seriously weak, although dual casting does make them stronger when you reach a certain level you can no longer totally rely on spells as in oblivion. buy it anyway since its still a great game",1
"would be an absolutely awesome game if bethesda could stop making the fundamental flaws they have in all there games. 2013 and you cannot rebind 3-4 very important keys???????????? as well as having to edit .ini files to turn v sync off, disable depth of field, mouse acceleration & change your field of view. really, really, really sick of having to spend 2-3 hours to get bethesda games running smoothly. if they took as much care with the basics as they did with the game 90/100, without 85/100.",1
"bought it just for fun and thought i was gonna only play it for like an hour but i thought wrong i hae now played it for 25 hours and i still love it! really really really nice game and if you add some mods too it becomes the ultimate game! so i definetly gives it thumbs up!",1
"great with mods. you will get burned out after a couple hundred hours though.",3
"prepare your  for the immense amount of joy you will be having playing this wonderful masterpiece, and also brace yourself for experiencing lack of sleep, because this game is very, very, very, very... addicting.",1
"this game is absolutely amazing. buncha dragons (yo), buncha story quests (yo!), hot babes and hot guys (yoooo!) and just a lot of friggin crap you can do (yooooooooo!) 10/10 would buy this game 30 times, go play it. too op, too fun.",1
"wow was i wrong about this, (if you suffer lag check your sensitivity mine was well low) i love it and got it not that long ago!!!",1
"acceptable substitute for breaking up fallout marathons, but be prepared to spend 400 hours thinking, i wish i were playing fallout right now.",2
"never have i thought to myself, i would like a rabbit that can shout like me, a giant lizard running around kicking people as i yell, godzilla!!!, female npcs with large breasts, a dragon that is almost identical to macho-man randy savage, and the ability to kill kids. that was before i played skyrim on pc. you hear people who play this on xbox go on and on about finding dawnbreaker or completing the dark brotherhood questline. i just butt in and say, yeah, but have you ever ridden a giant rabbit into battle? 12/10 like skyrim with mods.",1
"this is by far the best game ive ever played, between all the side quests,factions, there is almost no way to run out of things to do in this game",1
"a fun game with great graphics and many quests. is that not enough yet? well, players can mod it freely and create their own content. and because of that, it really never gets boring. the only weak points of the game: - no multiplayer - main story quest, like in all the sandbox games, is rather weak.",1
"i played a little and i was captivated by this game! it is amazing and so many ways you can play this game. there is so many things to do and you never actually finish this game. i have been playing for a few hours and after finishing the main story line i am at least like 1% through skyrim. you have a hell of a time with this great game. this is very entertaining. i always said nah this game is boring until i sat down and played. i was forced but i found out this is a great game! highly recomended. you can mod it till it breaks if you get bored of standard. this game you can do whatever you want! the trailer is for once not lying and just showing the perks in the game, it actually is that bloody awesome the whole time. the trailer shows like 5% of awesomeness, but hey who the hell can fit all that awesomeness into 2 minutes?",1
"best immersive-game ive ever played. i recommend to mod it to the fullest and play the game.",2
"this game is jaw dropping. the immersion is second to none, with amazing graphics, a ludicrously detailed world, and surprisingly good voice acting considering the sheer number of npcs across the vast land that is skyrim. oh, and they actually did dragons correctly for the first time in video games. theres also over 300 hours of content with dlc on the way. buy immediately.",1
"one of my most played rpgs other than dark souls. ive spent hours apon hours playing, moding, and just having a blast. i would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys rpgs, good lore, and killing dragons.",1
"i used to be an adventurer like you, then i took an arrow in the kne- aaaaah my knee i totaly didnt shoot him in the knee",1
"love this game so much! rented it enough times from redbox that i pretty much owned it. then finally broke down and bought it on here. my first encounters with the elder scrolls universe and it has lead me to go back and play the previous entries.",1
"359 hours says a lot especially considering thats hours where i didnt use rcrn you could probably quadrupple that or something. great game just dont break it by over modding, like i do.",2
"even at 354 hours ( at the time or writing ), i can safely say i have not completed the game. there is just so much content with the game that you can multiple playthroughs and never end up the same way. after you beat the main quest there is still so much to do that it doesnt feel like the game ended. it takes after oblivion in the sense that you can dedicate a lot of time into one guild, whether it be thieves, dark brotherhood, or the champions, or just focus on the main quest and have a race with a friend to see who can finish first. i personally would recommend this to anyone with a powerful enough computer, one that is about three years old should be able to handle it. the quests can pile up and seem overwhelming with the amount to do at times, but other than that pesky nuisance it is almost perfect to anyone looking for an open world adventure of a lifetime",2
"this a very well made game, it has days of game play, amazing game feel, a huge area to explore, things to do around every corner. you can be what ever you want, a warrior, a mage!, a theif, a necromancer, a mage-theif-warrior, a badass, anything! the story is amazing, in addition to this the game can get extremly imersive! listen, i could go on forever on how this is a great game, so just please get it!",2
"by far one of the best games ive ever played! the only issues are the freezing and the ctd. if you like free roam games with lots of things you can do and customize, buy it. buy it now.",1
"ive waited for the legendary edition-release to start this game. after finishing up the tutorial i am already amazed, reminds me of fallout 3, but replace the futuristic setting by a medieval one. excellent bethesda-work.",1
"great game, great graphics, great sound, great storyline, and great mods. what else can a man ask for? :p",1
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"between my pc copy and xbox i have now sunk over 300 hours into skyrim, it has to be the best value for money game ever!",2
"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",1
"the combat and animation are crap, but its fun exploring the open world. btw, i have already achieved chim.",1
"not only is there an amazing amount of quality gameplay, but skyrim has one of the best modding communities on steam. youll never run out of quests, adventures, or the ability to call trains from the sky.",2
"why did i wait so long to play this game? im making up for it now.",1
"one of the best open world games ever. has hours of gameplay and hours more if you do the side quests. all its dlc is fun and you should buy the legendary version. its also easily modable and the mods bring more fun to the already fun game plus the mods on external sites like the skyrim nexus brings more easily installed fun, also space core mod cant beat that.",2
"i love this game... there is so much to do in skyrim the only annoying part of this game is the beginning and by annoying i mean: o my god id rather kill myself. from picking up flowers ingame to modding the crap out of it, everything is fun, i got almost 200 hours in it and there are many more hours to come! definitely a must buy if you like games that arent over in a couple of hours. the story of this game is meh but everything else is superb. 9.5/10",1
"it worked i like that about the game so i like bacon thanks to this game deffinaltey worth a buy :d",1
"the best game that i have ever played. if you have not played it yet you have missed one of the best experiences in gaming.",1
"there is literaly nothing i can say that is bad about this game.... the graphics are amazing, the gameplay is fluent and very fun, you never run out of things to do, unlimited custimization, good story, and well.... i could go on for days but to sum it up. i would have gladly payed more than what i did for this game.... if you havent tried it, you need to",1
"what can i say really that as not already been said its a pretty awesome game",1
"awesome game! ive had it since launch and still play it for hours on end! over 1k hours over all. for some reason using skse seems to interfere with my hours played, so only about 540 are recorded at the time of this review. i started off with vanilla for the first 400-450 hours. the rest were with mods. first the workshop mods, then lately nexus mods. this game was well worth paying $60 + cost of the dlc on released. i dont regret it at all! get the legendary edition if you dont own skyrim already. well worth it!",2
"this is such a great game. ive already created a level 21 nord character. boy, its a blast. the graphics are stunning! you can see the details on each individual plant and leaf. one leaf blew right by my face as i was walking down the beaten path of a mountain and i sat there for literally 15 minutes just thinking wow at the magnificent detail of the leaf. this is the greatest game of the century, until another good game comes. i wouldnt be surprised if i were to have a special time with some of the female models in this game. they are that realistic. this is the greatest game in the world!! i love it!!",1
"no other game has ever hooked me into an open world of such enormous size and amazed me with such a gargantuan amount of content. wherever i travelled in this mammoth of a game, i kept stumbling upon more quests to complete. ive put over 100 hours into this, yet i feel like ive only scratched the surface of what there is to find. unfortunately, the amount of trivial imperfections in-between all of skyrims good qualities put together escalates into quite an issue, and it ends up being that ultimate obstacle which stops the game on its way to reaching prime status. nevertheless, that does not matter. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the finest role-playing games ever made and the most addictive and fully-featured open world ive ever been to in gaming. furthermore - with future updates & patches, as well as free mods, it will only get better and perhaps one day it will reach the 10/10 grade. in the end, skyrim is an extraordinary game that shouldnt be missed by anyone.",1
"i am addicted. noone can help anymore. help. please. 450/100",1
"had skyrim for xbox before switching to pc and still put another 100+ hours on it. well work it.",1
"spent lots of hours playing on xbox,pc version is way better and with steam workshop makes it 12 out of 10 best rpg without a doubt,only thing that suks is no co-op,imagine playing this with friends",1
"completely immersive, addictive and savagely breathtaking.",3
"bought this game for the xbox, had to buy it again for the pc for all the mods!",1
"highly recommended with all the mods available although it is a little outdated but this just means more pcs will be able to run it. if you think this games grapics dont look too good i suggest going to nexus as they have more mods or just use steam workshop if your lazy. overall a great game and i suggest the legendary edition for the full experience! i have spent 100 hours on it, io have finished the main questline but i still keep on coming back to it.",1
"the game is just awesome. even when you play a character for like 100 to 200 hours you can create a new one and make so many things diffrent: you can decide for another faction, fight completly diffrent or just make diffrent decisions on smaller quest. and there is so much more! expect enough quests, achivements and goals which you can also set for yourself such as creating powerful armor sets or building your own house by finding and collecting everything by yourself (hearthfire!). totally worth it!",1
"i recommend the online one right now because its new and its really cool",1
"this game is very well made, im able to run it on my laptop on highest settings with no problem. the gameplay itself is as always with the elder scrolls series is deep and involving and with completely new stretch of lands to discover and explore, will give many hours of excellent gameplay. you create your own destiny as a dragonborn and as such you can speak the voice of the dragons knows as shouts and must explore the lands and slay dragons to learn more ancient dragon words to help you on your journey. there is also several new features in this installment of eldar scroll being that you can now create your own armour at the forge, enchanting has been improved somewhat and alchemy now has to be done at dedicated places. overall this is a must have for the fans of eldar scrolls series, the rpg elements have been dumbed down since oblivion but it is still an excellent game.",1
"only way this could be better is if they let you customise shouts  i said shtahp! very large, immersive open world and you never know what is around the corner, many a night i have said just one more quest, just till i finish this quest and....... its 6am.....! combat is well designed and i personaly love it when i paralise someone with an arrow only to have them launched into the air due to the ragdoll physics (not realistic but i cry cause i laugh so hard each time)",1
"a game that gives back what you put into it.you can hack and slash, ignoring the side quests and dialog, or you can spend hours reading the books you find in peoples rooms and hunt butterflies without a net. a truly immersive exxperience.",1
"the most overated game of all time, i had no fun plaing it and got bored after 3 hours",1
"it will eat your life ... in a good way. hundreds of hours at a time.",1
"endless fun. got almost 700 hours now and with mods the contents just keeps comming!",3
"great game one of the best games i play, u dont have to follow the quests so u can just explore but the start can be kinda laggy but it stops as soon as the start is over.",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",1
"i used to play this on consoles, but then i took an arrow to the knee... anyways what more can i say, its skyrim! if you dont have it get it!!",1
"best rpg even after two years since release and i still play it all the time.",1
"11/11 the elder scrolls v: skyrim is the best game of all time. the scope, scale and freedom of the game is unimaginable. the atmosphere is vibrant with a deep lore and story. a beautiful masterpiece with an amazing soundtrack. i urge you to keep your favorite screenshots and music tracks somewhere safe because in 10 years time when new games have rendered this one obsolete you can go back through those memories again and remember just how special skyrim was to you. youll argue with fans of the newer games sharing reasons for why skyrim was better. they wont understand and how can they. their memories will be with newer games that have built on skyrims strengths further. they wont appreciate how without earlier games the ones that theyre playing now wouldnt be possible. you too can become a nostalgic loser who hates new games just because they change things. got this game for the ps3 and sunk in hundreds of hours. if you got it on console it is totally worth getting it for pc for the massive modding community. if there were one thing i would forget. it would be this game only so i could experience it again. skyrim is love skyrim is life.",1
"this is typical elder scrolls genius in lore writing and story telling. with any elder scrolls title its like being cast in your very own fantasy novel. great story, loads to do, excellent voice acting, beautiful graphics. my only disappointment with skyrim was a completely personal disappointment because it felt less magical, and mysterious than morrowind / daggerfall. the whole feel of the game is very viking-ish and it felt like i was playing 3d heimdall or game of thrones most of the time - bit too graphically similar and imo boring to look at. i think i personally prefer the more fantastical things, like silt striders, the ghosts of daggerfall, the temples of vivec, oblivion gates? i dont know it just felt a little too much like a viking story book to me. obviously there are dragons and giants, which was amazing to experience in a game in this manner but for me at least there was never a moment where you felt like the hero of the tale, it was more about destiny than choice which in the end became fairly linear - and i just wanted to get the main quest finished so i could enjoy the game. overall though its impressive, beautiful and fairly deep as you would expect from any elder scrolls title. well worth a play and will seriously last you for playability, and re-playability. expansion packs are available and they too are all worth a try :)",2
"skyrim is the best game in the world and i do recommend this game!!!!",1
"i am a long-time fan of the elder scrolls series, and they have been putting out game after game for years. each time a new game comes out, it pushes the limit of the gamers experience. this game is no different, 50 hrs of gameplay will pass before you know it.",1
"what can i say about skyrim that hasnt already been said. it was outstanding when it first game out and a worthy sequel for the other elder scrolls. the graphics, sadly, though mind blowing at the time have obviously dated but the complex story lines and huge array of quests gives it such replayability. i havent stopped playing it since it first came out and i dont see a future where i stop either.",1
"i helped lucan take his gold dragon claw back from its theft, then proceeded to steal it again 10/10",2
"bethesdas maser piece even after 2 years its still as good as the first time you play it. looks great and plays even better.",3
"after holding on to this game for three years, i am still playing it. the game is like a good choose your own adventure book that you can play again and again and again. very good and very addictive, this game is a life choice not a game choice. :d",1
"this + texture/hd mods = a beautiful gaming experience. skyrim. get it.",2
"awesome game! bethesda has definately learned from its past titles.",1
"i think after playing this game i can safely say that fast travel is the most hilarious way to mask  world design by allowing you to skip over it ive ever seen and that having more content usually comes at the cost of -tier content like , why build interesting worlds and fun content when the modders can do it for you!? how dare people expect quality for their 60 dollar day one purchase! how dare they expect the dlc to not be house mods! how dare they! bethesda tries so hard for them like the poor triple a multi-million dollar corporation they are! then again enderal looks like a neat total conversion/fan fix to a  game so i guess theres that also i feel i should elaborate how this game is indeed quite disappointing, let me say it this way, nearly every sandbox game, rpg, or sandbox rpg ive played in the past 8 years, , thats been released since daggerfall, has entertained me more than this skyrim is a broken mess of a game that needs mods, as far as being broken you cant go wrong with smithing in markath (was it that town? i dont even remember) where you can literally just wait 24 hours, steal ingots, smith, wait 24 hours, staal the same ing ingots, smith, until you have maxed it out and can build dragon scale armor or something as for story, nothing really happens, you never really matter, and the ending is the greatest cop-out ive ever seen",1
"awesome game, youll beat it once, and just keep playing afterwards",1
"break the game after modding in everything from nicer weather to unoffical gameplay dlcs. and naked people, of course. loot everything thats not bolted down, enjoy varied foods ranging from delicious cooked veggie soups to fresh picked giants toes. marry your housekarl. realize after sprawling around in this giant sandbox for 30 hours that you still havent done a thing to progress your main quest.",1
"this game definitely lives up to its hype/high praise. ive spent way too many hours playing this game, loving it, with many more hours to come.",1
"this game has sucked in more hours of my life than i care to mention. (mostly on the xbox though) its well worth the time and money. great game.",1
"amazing game ive been playing it from day 1, on and off and with the amazing modding community, this game keeps on giving.",1
"pretty ok for a modern rpg but nothing to write home about, only worth it at a significant discount",1
"its ok at first but its combat mechanics and storyline have no real depth to them. i found the story boring and played out and the combat leaves a  to be desired. if you like rpgs and have experience in the genre youll end up feeling unsatisfied, because there isnt really any balance in the late-game, modded or not, and the combat is absolutely horrendous. that being said, i was able to spend 300 hours in it regardless of its flaws. thats because this game has an extremely high production value and looks absolutely stellar.",2

"kill a chicken while someone is looking=wanted kill a person while a chicken is looking=wanted steal a potato=wanted 150/10 would steal potato and beat chicken with it again...",1
"i honestly adore this game, first single player game i got 100+ hours, i started off playing and after you get the first bit of the main quest done you have so much freedom. i got about 70-80 hours in and realised i hadnt gotten further in the main quest, and at this point i completed most of what i could (note: i mainly just looked for quests that interested me, there was still a lot of quests i outright avoided at this point). the graphics are beautiful, i adore simply running around in the world, particuarly at night in snowy areas, and hunting the wildlife. the gigantic range of mods for armour, quests, graphical improvements, etc... while honestly not really necessary because the game is fantastic on its own, helped just add that bit more to the game i felt it lacked after that 100 hour mark (in saying this, there is still a lot of storylines i hadnt even started, mainly due to lack of interest). anyway, the game is fantastic, i would strongly recommend playing it.",1
"elder scrolls was and always will be the best rpg game in my eyes, but skyrim took it too a whole new level.",1
"got rekt by a giant, went flying, saw a dragon on my way up, oh and lydia is a dumb",1

"pros: can shout at a dragon can shout at guards can give people arrows in the knee can steal all the cabbage cons: not enough sweetrolls so in total 23/5",1
"the best open world experience in the series. the best way to enjoy this game is to download a mod to make dragons spawn at greater rates. there are really good mods out there that make the game authentic, or to add something the developers didnt. this game is quite a journey - when you dont use the console commands. dont do it - its a bad habit. take it from me.",3
"this is a welcome installment to the elder scrolls series, the detail put into a goodly portion of this game make it even more awe inspiring thatn its two older brothers that also had a more visual theme (for those that dont know, the first two elder scrolls games were more or less text based, morrowing is the first time we got to take a proper look around the provinces of tamriel) it does have a few bugs, but with a game this big, you have to expect a few (frostbite spiders not withstanding) and the community and mods ive found so far, merely enhance everything for me as a whole, i highly recommend this game to those who love going out and exploring and adventuring, it will drain a lot of hours, but youll always find something new and fun to do",1
"this game is a very amazing sandbox/quest adventure game with great graphics, gameplay, quests, npcs, and arrows to the knee. this is one of the amazing game series the elder scrolls! as you can see my gametime is huge and im not even nearly bored. the game is 10/10 then with all 3 dlc for the game, its byfar overwhelmingly good. then if you get into modding then, well the amazingness and awesomeness will explode!!!!!!!!!!!!!! fus roh dah!",2
"its a great game but its very buggy for me. my computer is at or past the recommended settings but i get constant frame drops and freezes. contacted bethesda and they pretty much gave up on me. the only solution now is to buy a better graphics card i guess. buy it if youre sure you wont have any problems.",1
"not a whole lot needs to be said about skyrim. if you havent been living in a hole for the past 3 years, youve at least heard of it. there are almost infinite things to do, but with a level of structure sandboxes lack. pc is definitely the platform of choice for this game, partly due to better performance, but mostly due to its extensive modding community thats always adding even more content.",4
"8.5/10 amazing game with beautiful graphics and a pretty good storyline. the side quests can get repetitive and the mounted combat is terrible, but other than that its a solid game.",1
"skyrim hardly needs a recommendation, but here goes: i have always liked the elder scrolls games, but i havent always liked playing the elder scrolls games. i still have my boxed copies of arena and daggerfall, and memories of endless patching. i never got anywhere much in morrowind, and oblivion just kind of lost me. skyrim expertly tickles that lizard part of my brain that likes exploration. no matter how much you wander -- and 40 of my 48 hours in-game have been wandering -- theres still something new to see, guaranteed. i havent even been to three of the major towns of skyrim yet. ive walked past countless towers, ruins, fortresses and caves. my journal is full of abandoned quests i wish i could move to a seperate section so i never felt a twinge about well, maybe, since i said yes, i should go and do that. and yet still i want to wander and find more stuff to do. i think this must be what crack cocaine is like. later edit: definitely not crack cocaine because suddenly, 58 hours or so in, my brain decided: nope! dont want to do this any more! and i stopped. still, how many games do i ever play for almost 60 hours? none, thats how many.",1
"for the small amount that ive played so far its amazing ive never played any of the elder scrolls games but its an awesome game their is so many quests and imense detail :)",1
"probably the best game of all time. you never get bored no matter how many playthroughs you do and if you get bored of the original you can try the dlcs and the amazing mods. they are really well. i cant really rate this game cause 10/10 is to low for it.",1
"skyrim is a very great game. it surrounds you with lore all throughout the game. the amount of detail put into it is amazing, every single dungeon and house is mostly different and unique. and it is the best free roam expierence i have had in years. it has kept me entertained for 2 years with all the mods and stuff.",2
"what can i say the best rpg game i have played. i love the mod support and the mods that you can find so creative and unquie, also naughty if your in to that. the game developers dont even mind if you fix the game because there is alot of unoffcial fixes and i know some companies dont like that",1
"best open world game ever alongside fallout 3. pure fun.",1
"quits skyrim every 5 minutes to install more mods #modituntillitcrashes",1
"phenominal rpg game that takes on a whole new look at the elder scroll series. out of ten, this game should receive a 9.9.",1
"huge environments. nice graphics. amusing(but not game breaking) glitches. tons of quests. massive character customization/growth. it does become very unbalanced(in your favor) once you reach higher levels(30+) since the enemies stop scaling their level to yours, but its still very fun exploring the huge world and dungeons full of interesting(and mundane) quests, fighting the random dragon attacks, and learning new abilities as you go! 100s of hours of entertainment for the ocd rpg lover.",2
"if you like to wander the world, explore, adventure, and learn, this is your game. the moment you hit the great outdoors, theres a vast expanse of wilderness and towns to discover. ancient ruins and moldering caves will also tempt you. what makes the game particularly good is the conversations with inhabitants. the amount of dialog and stories these characters posses is astonishing. the game may be a few years old, but it holds up well (particularly if you add some of the community mods)!",2
"got killed for stealing a wooden bowl. 11/10 would mod the  out of again.",1
"still a fun fantasy setting with high magic and decent stories if you are willing to look for them.",1
"one of my favorite games of all time. i dont know what i could say on here that hasnt been said, so if you havent played this game before, try it already. you wont be dissapointed (unless you have something against fun).",1
"extremely fun! awesome graphics and a compelling story",1
"im fat, and i got this game, so... this game is for fat people. i like it, i like fat people too.",1
"i hear alot about how the previous installments were so much better and blah blah but i can somewhat relate as i am a hardcore old school gamer (snes and nes). id pick snes mario and zelda games over current installments any time of the year. but in this instance i truly think skyrim changed tes for the better. there has never been a game that blended action and rpg so well as skyrim. the previous elder scrolls were really rpg heavy and therefore catered to pc rpg psychopaths that have a strong hate for console gamers. but what skyrim created was a bridge between console gamings action and pc gamings rpg and produced greatness. better is relative on the subject of tes games, but in terms of overall; skyrim hands down. everything cant be a loot fest, skyrim added incredible immersive combat that goes nice with the rpg legacy of tes series.",1
"one of the best immersive rpgs ive played. although too many mods can ruin some things. also would love skyrim with 2-6 player co-op.",1
"when youre bored, skyrim is there for you. always.",1
"alot of fun , fun with or without mods,looking forward to the online verson",3
"pros: +fus ro dah +like the biggest rpg +giant world +heaps of fantasy creatures and fantasy magic +epic and awsome gameplay +great graphics especially if you install a texture pack +epic story +quite realistic cons like no cons if you have the money defanatly buy this game great game",2

"if you like getting sucked into a game only to find that you spent the entire weekend inside then buy this game!!!",1
"this game is an amalgamation of all the game design experience and story telling expertise that bethesda has gathered over the years. this game is dense with adventure and contains copious amounts of polish on almost every level. i couldnt reccomend this game more!",2
"i love this game, used to play all the other elder scrolls when i was younger on xbox, but then i bought a pc and i realised i needed to rebuy this game. this game is never ending awesomeness if your into rpg and theres hundreds of quests and things to do. if you have a lot of free time i recommend!",1
"this game is an absolute treasure to have. dont listen to the bigots and the next-gen haters, who slander skyrim every chance they get because it wasnt exactly what they wanted. haters gonna hate, and this game is not worth the hate. it is fantastic, the visuals are great, the combat is smooth, every aspect is entertaining 120% be weary, however, that if you download too many mods, the game will become non-functioning. it is a terrible hassle to deal with, so i suggest you only get the most popular mods. most popular = most smooth.",2
"the epicness of skyrim just blows you away, huge land to explore lot of things to do in this game. the value added by mods to this game is nearly infinite. 100% recommended!",1
"im addicted to this game! there is so much to do in this awesome open-world rpg. the steam workshop makes it so much more fun too with a bunch of cool content to download and make your experience with this game even better. ive already spent 240 hours playing it.",2
"it seems long ago now, looking back, when this game was first released. i had played morrowind, i have played oblivion, loved both, and i was left eagerly awaiting skyrim. and i was not disappointed. bethesda again reminds me of what true quality is. in short, this game is amazing. but more that that, it gives everyone who would give it a chance, everyone that would allow themselves to gently fall into its landscape, a fantastical escape from the occasional blandness of life. we all need escapes, time away from the coffee and the concrete, and skyrim provides a window. its not a replacement for anything, its merely an avenue to get lost in your own imagination. those who cant let go, cant dream of fantasy, should avoid skyrim. for everyone else, i high recommend you give this game a try and give yourself a chance to get lost in its wonder.",1
"beautifully rendered open world with picturesque landscapes. engaging and intuitive combat and gameplay mechanics. rich backstory with worlds of lore to uncover. one of the biggest mod communities ever. yes please. mostly good voice acting, but a little repetitive and heartless at times. too much stuff to really find in one play through, easy to lose yourself (both a good and bad thing). those things are easy to get over.",1
"loved skyrim even with its flaws. high hopes for argonia.",2
"ever wanted to waste more time in one game than in real life.",1

"what more can be said? this is one of the best games iver ever played. it stands right next to new vegas. it is beautiful and as open as they get. you can be anything and pretty much do anything. the voice acting is great. and because the makers are wonderful people, any deficiencies you find can be modded away. i was happy with the step mod line myself. hundreds of hours of play. this game is one of the those rare games that is well worth the money. buy. enjoy. the dark brotherhood needs you.",3
"well, its hard to say really. skyrim is sort of uh, well you know, um. . . a lifestyle? no. . . a miracle? no. . . ah! i got it!. the eighth wonder of the world. yup, pretty much sums it up.",1
"worth every penny, a must have game. the elder scroll series overall is worth it.",1
"if your big in 2 rpg ,fantasy,dragons,storys that have adventure, makeing all diffrent kinds of wepons and amor, & yes did i say magic potions best of all this game is far from being short it has any where from 500 - 1000 hours of game play all depending on how deep you get into the game quest & side quest that sort of thing. i can go on and on and on there is just so much to do i give it a 5 out of 5 stars one of the best games i have ever played. and i played a lot of games i started out in the early 1980s on my 2600 atri.any how skyrim has it all. most of us gamers know about skyrim ! but there is always some 1 who hasnt. so check it out !!!!",2
"quite simply put, id say a brief summary of what skyrim is for me is pure awesome!",1
"like harvest moon but with fables. the crafting simulator 2014. 15/10",1
"few games have captivated me like skyrim. there are so many good things to say about it, but i am sure they have already been said. so i will mentiona few of the things that i loved, that are not often praised. first of all, i have put over 200 hours into my ps3 copy of this game, so much of my experience is based on that. i bought the game the day of release, and played for 20 hours non-stop. without even touching the main story line. the thing that drew me in was the absoulte depth of the scenery and the breathtaking beauty it brings. another huge positive of this game is its character upgrade system. many games have simple sliders that you increase whenever you level up, which makes things seem very unimportant. however, skyrim offers a huge skill tree that you can see individual skills that you can choose. finally, i like the the way the inventory is set up. although it was created with consoles in mind, it transfers pretty nicely over to pc (there are mods to make it just a little more mouse friendly). the information is presented in a clear, uncluttered way that really compliments the ambiance that the atmosphere portrays. buy this game, you wont regret it.",1

"this game completely blew my mind. real life in the old times. epic rpg! 10/10",1
"this is a very good game where there is many diffrent kinds of gameplay because of how you start & of what happens to you throughout the game. many games are not like this one just because it is open world, you can choose what to do & when to do it, & the gameplay is always unique to each time you play. hopefully for whoever reads this review knows that buying, giving as a gift & playing this game are all good ideas that are worth it.",2
"awesome game, if you havent played it, get out from your cave and do it now",2
"very boring game, just going to be honest. dont believe the hype for this game, it will have you wasting time walking across an enormous map, usually covered in snow and bland mountain scenery. the magic in the game (especially the higher leveled spells) is very disappointing and after the first couple of quests i simply modded it, unlocked everything, messed around, and uninstalled the game, never to play it again, disheartened that i couldnt actually kill everything i saw and ravage the land if i wanted to (kids/quest givers). if you dont like fantasy/adventure/open world games, dont believe the hype that its good and will change your opinion, it certainly didnt mine (although, i did enjoy oblivion, which could be partially why i am biased).",1

"skyrim is the fifth game in the elder scrolls series of rpgs. its an open world, western-style role playing game in which you assume a character that you create in a fantasy-type setting. you choose the charcters race (various types of human, elf, cat-person, lizard-person, etc) and its starting abilities. from there, you level up the character however you want, whether you want to specialize in stealth and stealing, bows, one-handed or two-handed weapons, or combinations therein. you also level up their health, stamina, and many other statistics, as you wander around the world. there is a main quest to complete, but much of the draw of the es games is that you can literally go wherever you want, completely ignoring the main quest, and many other paths open up to you. you can even become a vampire or a werewolf if you want, though both have their drawbacks. the game also changes and reacts to your different decisions. so if you want to play through again as a different character, with different abilities, you can do vastly different things and basically its like a whole new game. this game has a lot of content plus dlcs. steam workshop and mods bring a lot of different things and lots of replay value! highly recommended!",2

"this game is straight out of 2011, but still holds up well to nowadays standards when keeping it vanilla. youre given a bunch of locations to explore, a bunch of quests to complete, a ton of bandits and animals to behead, and factions. whether you want to be bladesman, professional robber, or hitman. all yours to choose. the game starts off with a heavily scripted event, where youre about to get killed, but freed due to a dragons raid.  that- everyone knows that beaten path already. anyway, vanilla is good from the quantity of things to do. only thing that was painful for me was the skill grindfest. now to the amazing part. you can chunk a ton of mods onto this game and itll look better than recent releases, depending on how much your rig can handle. 2k textures? all there. 8k dragons? all good. a ton of enb shaders? even better cinematics than the one console players defend. though, workshop is poorly done. better grab only a few mods off there. best methods are nexus mod manager and mod organizer. if youre new to making games awesome, take it slow, or you might flip a table because you installed your ton of mods in the wrong order. now, go play the beaten path everyone knows,  up the dawnguard, and kill the emperor with your cooking skills, and dont forget to get yourself a good enb.",2

"i killed a chicken and the whole city turned against me, i killed the emperor and i got away with it. 10/10",1
"buy this, just do it. its fun, it seemingly never ends (im like 30 some hours into it and nowhere near running out of quests), and for 20 bucks its an epic deal.",1
"every elder scrolls is an action packed classic with amazing graphics, insane mods and great gameplay this could very well be one of the greatest games of all time",1
"as with all elder scrolls games, this one immerses the player in a world of vibrant colors, sounds, and lore. this game is far from perfect, as i play with a large amount of mods to make it more enjoyable, but it does not detract from its brilliance. the story is great, albeit a bit lazy on the finish. the scenery is awe inspiring, sometimes leaving me just to staring off a mountainside at its brilliance. i reccommend this game to anyone who wants to fight dragons, explore ancient ruins, and save the world.",1
"i think there is an end to this game somewhere. the fights are too easy for the most part.",2
"this game is fun, but its alot more fun with mods. recommendation: buy when it is on sale.",1
"this is an epic game. the greatest problem is that you will find yourself wondering, where did the last six hours go? a few times a week. overall 10/10.",1
"skyrim its an incredible game. aside from the fact that the game just bursts quite literally with content, its is unique atmosphere that truly draws you into playing it. this mixture between the actual game and steams workshop manages to add even more to an already fantastic experience, achieving fixes and overall improvements that allow you to create your own personal experience with the game. dont like the available armors? change them! dont like how many dragons are in the area? change it too! you have the freedom to explore a world that goes beyond your fondest memories and fantasies of the medieval, magical, fantastical times, a world where there are no rules, a world that its alive.",1
"what a pretty game in a huge and explorable world. unfortunately, its also really really boring.",1
"wonderful immersive game. played it to death on the xbox360 but loving the graphics and mods on the pc.",2
"i used to be an adventurer like you, then i got skyrim.",1
"this game is one of the best ones. just so yallll know.",1
"the coolest of the elder scrolls series, though i only mean the weather. its no threat to morrowind.",1
"it is skyrim, need i say more? haha. great game alone, even better when it is modded. between pc and xbox, i have documented over 800 hours on this baby :p",2
"skyrim is a very good and a very immersive medieval rpg, the immersion is even deeper with the oculus rift, but back on topic its done everything right, i recommend you download mods tho, i recommend immersive patrols, immersive weapons & immersive armour and if you have already played thru skyrim i recommend skyrim unbound as it freshens up the game. another good mod is skrim hd which makes skyrim look amazing!! 10/10",1
"this game.... is amazing. it has all of my favourite rpg characteristics; extensive character creation, unique experiences, story-changing choices and much much more. it also has more realistic parts, for example: marriage (both heterosexual and homosexual), granted bethesda copped some flack for oblivions heterosexual-only marriage, but it is still good to see homosexual marriage in the game. one of my favourite aspects of this game, is the fact that everyone has their own unique experience. both me and my friend can talk about skyrim all day and we willl always have different experiences. there are two minor (and clich) problems that i have with skyrim: 1) it has no multiplayer; skyrim would be even better if it had multiplayer. to quote maiq the liar (main easter-egg guy) : some like taking friends on adventures. maiq thinks being alone is better. less arguing about splitting treasure. but none the less, i can live without multiplayer. 2) as skyrim is a huge open-world game, it has a little more bugs than any other game. but those can be fixed (usually). if you are considering buying this game, then buy it. it is (in my opinion) one of the most immersive, fascinating and addictive games ever. i spent all summer playing this game. so i recommend this rpg to anyone. ~darthhaydo1",2
"i hate morrowwind.....i hate oblivion...boring boring games. yes yes im blaspheming. anywho this game..is gorgeous and amazingly fun and i love it.",1
"its in skyrim! whats not to love? you can do pretty much anthing, it looks great, its hilarious and its skyrim!  yeah.",1
"this has to be the absolute best game ive ever bought on my own. ive tried the console versions, and i really couldnt compare them to the pc version of the game. the mod factor with the workshop and nexus both allow for an infinite amount of playtime. i would recommend this game to literally anybody.",3
"this game is one of the best i have played, allowing you to explore many places in multiple environments. a good game with a good story, it will keep you enthralled for days. overall, i give it a 9/10",2
"good game, but oblivion has a way longer deeper storyline that skyrim.",1
"the rendering, scenes, gameplay and action is outstanding. well thought out, designed and impliemented. cant say enough good things about the game... the over 500 hours (lost lol!!) should say it all. looking forward to es/ol edition and es-vi and beyond...",2
"killed a chicken. villagers murdered me for that. karma got them back when a dragon killed them. 10/10",1
"very fun game that can be played several times without getting boring.",1
"with many hours on this game i will say its a good game. not great or perfect but good. with that in mind the game can only get better with mods ,but if you need mods to carry your game then well needs more work. with all my time i have seen almost all of the map which is fun. the rare encounters are unique and can help you understand the lore. the story was basicly a huge side mission, and was better in obilvion (in my opinion). and the ai is ok. as a final note the lore has made me happy as there is enough to fill a truck.",5
"what can you say about skyrim that hasnt been said? it is a rich, immersive, deep, time consuming and thoroughly satisfying simulator for demi-god life; and thats just the vanilla game. this is one of my all time favorite games and i cannot praise it enough, as it has kept me occupied for thousands of hours on consol and now pc. an easy to use perk and crafting system and easy to learn combat mechanics make it accessible to most levels of gamer, and to the devout there is a stupid amount of lore to explore and easter eggs to find. the 3 official dlcs are highly recommended, as they compliment and expand the vanilla game quite well. the cherry on top though is the very active mod community, and i would suggest to anyone buying this game to check out the steam workshop or nexus mods, as they exponentially increase the quality and length of the game. i love it, so much ive bought it twice, and i consider it a perfect marriage of old and new styles of rpg.",2
"rip life ;_; amazing graphics, immersive storyline, tons of gameplay. limitless combination of skills and character traits. 3/10 -ign",1
"words cannot begin to describe the sheer amount of enjoyment i have had whilst playing this game. its fukin sik lad!",1
"skyrim excels in the open-world department. while the main storyline itself is great, it is the sheer amount of side quests and things you can do (rolling 1000 cheese wheels down a hill anyone?) that make skyrim what it is. with its included mod support, which is decent, although slightly unstable at times, there is almost no limit to what you can do in skyrim, and as a result, you can easily lose hundreds, if not thousands of hours in this game. the game is more than worth its price, and while i personally like all the official dlcs, you dont need to them in order to have a fulfilling gameplay. all in all, an awesome buy.",2
"+runs well on bad computer +very immersive and atmospheric +lots of memorable moments and characters +lots of freedom, very non linear +100s of hours of content to do -sometimes buggy -repetitive levels and gameplay",1
"an amazing adventure i will never forget- and you certainly wont either. i dont think anyone has truly regretted buying this game, except the time its stolen away from their social life. skyrim alone without dlc or mods will give you at least 200 hours. add in all the dlc and youll have around 500 hours. add in an average amount of mods and youll have about 800 hours. depending on how much you love it and how involved you are in the modding community, youve got yourself an endless game to play for years to come.",4
"if you need a reason to get this game, get it for the absolutely incredible, never-ending list of mods available for it!",1
"i was very unsure of this game at the start, but it soon started to grow on me and i now spend my time planning what to do on the game when i cant play it! the amount of quest lines on this game is amazing! they are not just thrown together, but each quest is well thought out and each one is fun and exciting. ive not yet been on a grinding quest! thanks for putting together an amazing game!!",1
"the single greatest game ever made. the elder scrolls online was a disappointment compared to its predecessor, and thanks to the almost half a million mods the playable content is constantly expanding. just buy it.",1
"awesome game, great graphics, would definitely recommend.",1
"i had originally played this game on ps3 and loved it the moment i started, on pc my experience of skyrim has just been significantly enhanced. aside from the few minor glitches and 1 major glitch of a mission being broken skyrim is definitely one of the best games i have ever played.",1
"a nice experience to visit the lands of skyrim and fight dragons, spiders, monsters and every damn guard in every city. the game has a nice athmosphere and it just becomes better with the beautiful mods availible in the game. try it out!",1
"definitely recommend! on the xbox i have over 200 hours logged, and the pc i have like 40. if you are looking for something to use up all your time, i recommend it so much. if you beat the game then there is a giant (so so so giant) modding community out there. buy!",1
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",1
"good game had it for ps3 and can not wait to put even more hours in to it on pc",1
"what to say about this game? its fun, exciting and teaches you to fly.. after you foolishly try beating up a giant. its got something for everyone, no matter what your favourite play style. like charging at the enemy? grab a suitable sword and get hacking.... enjoy stealing stuff.. theives guild for you, and you can always do worse than joining the mages guild, calling yourself tim the enchanter and spending your days blowing up bits of the landscape, before mocking a passing party of knights. stir in a civil war, plenty of side quests, odd jobs, not so odd jobs, and just plain weird jobs and youve already spent 100 gaming hours exploring one huge sandbox of a game world before youve even tried starting the main quest. does the game have its faults? of course. the menu system could be better for us pc users, and the 3rd person kill cam breaks the illusion while you are in the midst of a huge battle. but all in, its worth the money and gets a boris rating of 9 gallons of napalm out of 10.",1
"are you bored? are you sad? play the skyrim dont be mad!",1
"the first 40 were outstanding. i was totally immersed, mostly due to the breathtaking visuals and the gorgeous, understated soundtrack. eventually you start to see the cracks - bizarre combat system, boring conversations, and a sense that nothing you do will actually change the world in any meaningful way - but the fact that it took 40 hours for me to get to that place is very impressive. oh, and once you do get to that place... mods!",1
"game is awesome, who is unknowing enough to qeustion it? but.. you know theres a problem when dlc is more expensive than the game itself",1
"probably one of the best rpgs ever made, with few drawbacks. a timeless open-world paradise.",1
"this game is so good its sucked up so much of my time and iv barely even started the main story i just walk around doing random stuff.",1
"the other day i was in a cave and it started raining. rain. in. a. cave! what kind of sorcery is this? 8/10",1
"one of the best rpg games i have played. and mods make it all the better. my favorite game ever!! 11/10",1
"good game (from content & depth perspective) but shamefully inadequate controls and a very very confusing map, no markers and difficult to get a bearing on the world map as well as the local map. thoroughly bad game from that perspective and the combat controls are extremely bad, total wate of money. do not buy this game. ... extremely bad game-play.",1
"if you liked morrowind, oblivion, fallout 3 and/or new vegas at all, you simply must try skyrim. you will not regret it.",1
"11/10 | their focus on dialogues served this game very well. also; dragons.",4
"beautiful rpg game, never ending in-game activites,quests and  load of mods.",1
"went into a tavern, picked up a wooden bowl, and the entire whiterun gaurd was on me in a second. 11/10",1
"i play this game often, despite the arrow in my knee.",1
"its a really good game to play and test your skills and use your own choise of going on a rampage in skyrim",1
"this is a 3rd person/1st person game addable mods . this is a rpg fun mob slaying, qeust playing,kind of game .",1
"this is a great game many hours of playing and tons of places you can explore. there is never a moment where you are bored the moment you start this game you would spend hours on it. once you beat the game there are tons of dlc to have more fun.",1
"one of my favorite rpgs, elder scrolls has just been a great series. you can play as any type of hero warrior, wizard, assassin, even a trader. skyrim has so much to do over 200 hours by it self. dlcs add hours of gameplay, plus there are some many mods its not even funny. mods to make the game more real or add more items or just do dumb stuff. all in all its just a good game with high replay value.",1
"this game almost ruined my life. i already give it a 5/5 rating, this game has a amazing replay value and the fact that i can do almost anything i so god damn well please is also a great factor in a game. im saying if you like farcry 3 or gta 5 get this. open world, choose your path, so many diffrent things to do, long as fudge, and there is so many mods! you will start this game and you wont get off till you ether beat it or grow a beard to the point where it hits your keyboard and you cant play becasu ehte hair is blocking you. in my opinon i say buy the damn game!",1
"fun, entertaining, and has a great storyline. 10/10",1
"learn the coding to fix your own bugs and youll have a beautiful game. an entire world all to yourself.",2
"bethesda just continues to make games that will suck you in to their universe and leave you wanting more. after putting a good 50+ hours into skyrim on console, i decided to purchase the legendary edition for pc. i knew i would not be disappointed for two reasons: the graphics & the mods. getting this game on the pc has reunited my love for skyrim, and i feel like im playing a totally new game now. easily in my top 5 action / rpg games of all time. (along with a couple other bethesda games..) as long as bethesda continues to pump out action / rpg, they will get my money.",1
"the next xhapter in the elder scroll epic. a superb game with almost unlimited replay value and hundreds of hours worth of gameplay. as open and free form rpgs go, this game has it all.",1
"cant seem to get enough of this game! love it! you never play the same way twice...unless you really want to but whats the fun in that?",2
"skyrim is such a time filler and you can play it for ages and not get bored. the world is completely open and if you have nothing better to do this is a game for you",1
"the adventures in elder scrolls v are as good as it gets. theyve done a truly remarkable job in making a beautiful world where you just want to see what lies around the next river bend or hilltop. skyrim has set the benchmark for graphic excellence in gaming. looking forward to see what they can do with this type of game when they add a more positive script to it!",1
"one of the rare sequels that manages to live up to its title and it goes way beyond that. you have to see it in order to believe it: massive open world, tons of things to do, magic, politics, bandits, monsters, dragons you name it. on the other hand you have the creation kit and a friendly modding community. there is no doubt in my mind that the elder scrolls skyrim is one of the best games ever created.",3
"i dabbled with oblivion. during morrowind i was probably too entrenched in mmos to be playing many single player games. so this was my first real experience with tes. and i have to say that bethesda has created one of the most detailed and interesting worlds ever. i played the game for 121 hours and never finished it. i just enjoyed exploring, doing all of the stories, talking to npcs, etc. in terms of the world, the look, the feel, the music this has got to be the best fantasy rpg ive ever touched. story? combat? mediocre (though again i have not finished the story but plan to fix that now that i got dragonborn). overall i still call this a great game but i can only imagine if bethesda was able to take this world and give me a story that pulled me in as much as games like baldurs gate 2 or mass effect series (well other than the last 10 minutes of me3). still if you have not played the game yet, wait for it to go on sale and grab it. and keep an eye out for eso. heres to hoping we can get a game that feels like tes but can deliver on the promise of enjoyable and meaningful rvr! (im rooting for you xenimax and especially you matt firor!)",1
"with all the great mods this game is endless, this is the next step in gameing..",4
"amazing, truly talos has guided me to get this game",2
"i love this game, and i love having it on pc. having the ability to mod the game almost limitlessly is a defining factor in having games like this for pc, and you can basically find a mod for anything you could possibly want. i highly recommend the unbound and requiem mods. they take the vanilla game, and make it much harder, giving you a more fulfilling experience.",2
"skyrim is awesome. however, if you have arachnophobia like i do, i recommend insects begone. it turns a nauseating experience into an enjoyable one, the way its supposed to be. frankly, i dont know why bethesda keeps putting spiders in their games. they didnt need have any in fallout 3, and they werent missed.",1
"mindless wandering and immersive exploring. simple but varied gameplay. an excellent way to kill a few hundred hours",1
"addicting. epic. social life ruiner. its all of these and more.",1
"i am in love with this game, the fun never ends. the 3 main types of characters you can be have so much depth. plus you can combine 2 of the types or even 3. it is deffinatly a fun game. plus with all the mods you can get it makes it even more fun. take that console plebs",2
"great game, do as you like with in it and amazing graphics espically with shaders and mods",1
"best game ive played this year. the glitches exist but its still absolutely amazing",2
"skyrim i am restarting this reivew because i did not inclued every thing. the game is great being my first steam and computer game i had to go to the public library to install it because i did not have internet at the time. lets start out with the story you are dragonborn/dovakin you dont know it at first that is until you kill a dragon. the graphics are so awsome and the soundtrack is great the combat is wonderful and there is a ton of quest for you to do theres lots of armors and the game can be modded on the steam workshop and there are tons of enemies to kill and animals. also you can join the stormcloacks or impearial legion and its like being in the army you go in battle and do quest for the side you joined. my scor is 9/10 because i wish there was more to the game like in the legion or stormcloacks you cant get in a massive battle like there is raiding battles but thats it but the game is awsome i recomend this game to everyone",1
"pickpocketed a guy of all his clothes and left him standing there naked... 11/10",1
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"this is the best game i have ever played :) so many things to do and so much fun!",1
"this is probably by far the best rpg you will ever play (until tes:vi is released). the graphics by default are gorgeous, although for those of you expecting far cry level ultra graphics you may be a bit disappointed; bethesda intended the graphics to be good, but also to be able to run on lower-end pcs. the main quest is immersive and tells a decent story, and there are also numerous side quests including thieves, mages and assassins - also not forgetting the civil war or the companions. the dawnguard and dragonborn dlcs also add in loads more hours of gameplay, also including a main quest for each and other numerous side quests. your character is who you want him/her to be: mage, knight, soldier, assassin, thief, etc... which is great for an rpg - i cant forget that you can also be an alchemist, a blacksmith an enchanter and/or a werewolf and/or vampire! the best part of this game for me though is the modding capability: there is literally a mod for everything! high resolution texture replacers for just about everything in-game, ranging from the landscape to tiny bits of clutter, extreme quality dlc type quest mods, amazing quality house mods, armour mods, weapon mods, etc... this game is a must for any pc gamer! 10/10",1
"skyrim is the absolute best openworld rpg you can find, side by side with morrowind.",1
"thsi dispicable attempt to bring the musical wicked to the big screen should be viewed by know one. the performances by betty white and clark kent were contrived and unoriginal falling short of their cost benefit analysis.",1
"its a good game, but it gets boring after a while and i think this game messed up my mouse cursor which now makes it irritating to move around",1
"this game is the most epic game evah!!!! if you download mods it will would be so fun and epic. this game is the best gamr ever.",1
"love the game its one of the magic games that have action and challege continue updateing this game :)",1
"open world dungeons-and-dragons-style adventure game. play in first or third person. make a lizard man that shots lightening out of his finger tips and marry gay cat man. fight dragons that look like the macho man randy savage while dressed as iron man, riding your fluttershy pony. the guitar playing bear sings of your great deeds. if you dont enjoy the idea of hack-n-slash first (or 3rd) person games, then the add-ons (free and seemlessly downloaded directly from steam so so easily) are worth a looky loo. buy it on sale (since its on sale almost every 2 weeks),",3
"i love games like this they take you to a world where you can be yourself",1
"09:00am - i gonna play this game just for 10 minutes, thats it! 22:00pm - wat time is it again?",1

"this is the first elder scroll game i have played and its pretty damn awesome. i should have played the series a long time ago",4
"a game where if you dont like the storyline you can just make your own, granted its slow and time consuming, so you can just look online to find other versions of it. i for one very much enjoyed the vanilla storylines of alduin and dawnguard (getting other dlc when i can) but ive also heavily modded my experience and found so much enjoyment and refreshment to this already fantastic game. never felt so deeply immersed in a game before. ive played on xbox and pc, pc is so amazingly superior there is no comparison, its a whole wide world out there. buy this game, get into it. recommended nexus mods: frostfall hunterborn realistic needs and diseases winter is coming wet and cold pumping iron realistic carry weight climates of tamriel civil war overhaul skyui towns and villages enhanced sounds of skyrim open cities skyrim w.a.t.e.r. skyrim uncapper immersive patrols",1

"all elder scrolls games have been good. this is finally one the mainstream cant ignore.",1
"ok, now hold on all of you xbox skyrim first timers that are looking at this review......its not a bad game! i had this game on xbox as soon as it came out and i was thoroughly dissapointed with the quality of this new masterpiece. it was just destroying me slowly so i had to get rid of it. so i bought my pc and thought that i might give it one last chance to see if this game is worth its reviews and high price. oh my f*cking god! this game is amazing! the console commands, endless amount of workshop items, unbelievable graphics and just everything about this beautiful game make it an amazing experience for anyone that knows what true quality is. sure the first missions can be boring in all, but please give it a chance you will not regret it! it has me stuck to this chair full of buttjuices just staring at it admiring the beauty. it even turned me lesbian! (jokes im a guy^^) but jesus, this game is marvellous! 100000000/10",1
"been playing this game for 1 year ( my game record should appear way longer than it appears, seems steam doesnt log offline hours ) and enjoying it. good graphics and great number of mods available ( i have pc edition ) add up to my satisfaction besides decent story and voice actings. not to mention you can steal those sweetrolls while fighting dragons. but all of these came with huge spec requirements and plenty of bugs, so leave that autosave on and careful when modding it, else you may lose some valuable game hours.",1
"i played a  ton of games but this one.. holy moly, its my favorite.. buy it and you wont regret anything.",1
"skyrim is an epic game that combines fantasy, adventure, and dragons. your character is the last of the dragonborn, a hero destined to destroy terrible dragons. you should think about getting it. seriously, get the game.",1
".... what can i say about this game that hasnt been said already? ill keep it short. get the legendary edition with all the dlc. go to nexusmods and be careful with not modding them game into instability. then call your boss and quit your job. the best rpg of all time is here.",1

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the few games actually worth its full retail value. ive put in many hours onto this game on xbox360 then i saw videos with the awesome addons and personalizations possible on pc so purchased it on steam also. this game is phenominal and worth every penny, im saying this and i didnt even buy this on sale. im really looking forward to the next game elder scrolls online. if you can buy skyrim though you should its worth every penny. i would still be playing it on pc if my computer was better but it couldnt really handle it-dell xps 13",1
"skyrim is like one of most favorite rpg, this is like the best one out of the serious, so much to do, and a lot to explore. play as the dragonborn who are born of the blood and soul of the dragon, but are still mortal; they can speak the tongue and language of the dragon language in which you can hear what the dragons say as you meet dragons and also fight others roaming around skyrim as you explore the world. you are the last of the dragonborn as you have to stop an evil dragon alduin who plans to destroy the world. you get a lot to do as you explore such as quests and places to explore, and gain shouts which are a new additon to skyrim as a dragonborn, shouts give you a different power as you explore and find each power of a shout. i enjoy this game a lot even mod it for fun, this game is a worth buy and poeple should get this game.",1

"the game by itself (althought very buggy for a finished product) is amazing and is worth a buy, but then you throw in all the mods and how easy its made with various tools and programs like the steam workshop, nexus mod manager, loot (load order optimization tool), and tes5edit, you can make skyrim into a completely new experience, many times over, with all the mods out there + the original game you could easily spend all of or most of your life playing skyrim and still not have seen everything, theres seriously that many mods out there (note some may not be compatible with others). if youre going to get into modding thought definitely invest in the nexus mod manager, steam workshop is good but if you eventually decide to switch your mods from steam versions to nexus version youll have to go through a real headache and possible have to re-install the game like i did, either way my point is buy this game.",1
"i downloaded over 80 mods, i have no idea what this game is anymore. 10/10",1
"after spending a great deal of time just playing this fantastic game, i think that i can easily recommend this game to anyone. the graphics are not the absolute best but great for the time. the ai and ui is fair and fitting for the game. the level of options and choices on what you want to doing is practically endless. the workshop and modding support from the community really transforms this game as the possibilities are never ending. also, i can not go without mentioning the bugs with this game but there is plenty of patches to fix almost all of them.",1

(also my data got corrupted so i had to start all over after 90 or so hours)",1

"its as though you live a second life within game first of all,let me ay this was the bet purchase i have ever made ,the story is great,the music is beautiful and sweeping when on mountain ranges and eery and dark,there are many npcs that will make you feel more immered in the lore of the elder scrolls series and the best part about that is that you dont have to be a seasoned elder scrolls player to comprehend the ins and outs of skyrim as the history of skyrim is taught to through vists to random town folk ,books and even conversations with vagabonds.the graphics are beautiful and i have a old rig so its most likely going to run on pretty much any rig.the game is perfect for anybody who likes action,rpgs in general or just likes to relax,i promise this will be the best 7:49 (holiday deal price) youve ever spent. ps:buy all the dlcs its only right for the experience",2

"i have bought time game 4 times so far. one on my console, where i played for over 200 hours before starting a second character (then playing for another few hundred hours across other builds). i have bought it for my pc and if you are a fan of the game on console and are unsure if it is worth it... it is. the ability to mod this game is just amazing. there are so many amazing mods. from skyre to change the combat up, enb and other visual mods (static mesh improvement mod is the most notable for me, along with water and flora mods), falskaar to add new lands... this game just keeps on giving and giving. twice have i bought the legendary edition on sale. just because it was on sale and gaben pls. it makes a nice gift, except that the games so awesome that everyone has it. i highly recommend this to anyone who has not got it.",1
"i have played countless hours of this on ps3 and pc and i regret nothing. recommended for everyone with the slightest interest in rpgs",1
"bethesda is without a doubt my favourite game developer. i love all tes games and while i have to go back and complete oblivion and morrowind (if ever) i have put in many hours & love them a lot. skyrim is no exception. this game is the best yet. maybe its not for everyone but i built a new computer to play this game and hell it was worth it! the, quests, people and world are just amazing and when that gets a little old, well.. theres always mods - thats why you dont ever get it on console! gameplay: 9.8/10 graphics: 9/10 sound: 9.8/10 overall: 9.5/10",2
"another good installment in the elder scrolls series, though it can be plagued with bugs. in my case, for the longest time the game would crash if played in online mode. other, more minor bugs, need some console commands to fix. but when all is said and done, this game will give you hours of gameplay, with quests and exploring, especially with all the dlc.",1
"hmm... if you are reading this because you havent played this game, you shouldnt need to read any reviews to understand that this game is amazing. listen to your friends who are stunned that you havent played skyrim. skyrim is like grand theft auto in a mid evil time with better story line. you can be good, bad or evil. you can spend so much time on this game. i bought this game for ps3, but it had issues after installing the dlcs with loading screens taking 2-3 minutes. i then bought legendary edition of skyrim on steam (basically you get all the dlcs with legendary edition), and it is flawless. i have probably spent 650 hours playing this game between ps3 and pc. i highly recommend checking out the steam workshop if you play this game, because you can make the game look a lot better if you have a nice graphics card. there are also ways to cheat with steam workshop (stupid powerful weapons, armor that makes you invincible, etc), but i didnt feel like making the game easy. all in all, i think i will remember this game for many years to come.",1
"played offline with requiem. mods are great. 10/10. definitely better than the ps3 version.",1
"with the dragonborn dlc i have set the order of the story some what backwards. and now wish that there was a way to save alduin. because perhaps his complaint is that miraak was a jerk. or what ever but. i must wonder since it was alduin who saves me from the chopping block. please share!",1
"this game was incredibly overhyped. by default without mods the graphics are not astronimcally superior to the previous game that was released in 2006. (with extensive modification this game can appear next gen but it requires a beast of a pc and i dont have one.) it released with just as many bugs. did not improve upon previous games failings enough and in fact disapointed majorly in some areas. *cities in skyrim are smaller than they were in oblivion *boring repeatable mmo style fetch quests *uninspired linear, short guild questchains. i was very disapointed in the thieves guild and dark brotherhood guild quests. *no decision making, no morality just lame fame and infamy again. ask about rumors, decline and accept quests, say hello same thrilling dialogue style as the previous elder scrolls titles. *reused assets from oblivion , enchanted special weapons (chilldrend, mehrunes razor ect) *tedious crafting *sneaking nerfed *removal of skills and birthsigns and classes. quite the shame because after the disaster that was elder scrolls online and its continued support for likely the next 5 years at the least until they close up shop its unlikely we will see another installment any time soon.",1
"skyrim is fun, large, and interesting. my main issue with it is that the balance is pretty terrible, particularly for magic users.",1
"its a fun sandbox game where you can kill dragons and eat sweet rolls",1
"now it looks like i havent played much but, i have play at least 200 hours on the xbox and another 12 on here. this game is like your casual rpg but with over 500 hours of gamplay and so much extra content not including mods. it however does have a few bugs barely noticable but still there.",1
"i used to play oblivion till i took an arrow to the knee",2
"my personal choice for game of the year 2011. i enjoyed the fourth game, oblivion, but skyrim is so much better in every way. beautiful landscapes and old dungeons that beg to be explored. its sad that the game has so many bugs (many can be fixed with the console in the game) that sometimes ruin the illusion. but even with the bugs accounted for this is an adventure worth taking. if playing with swords or casting magic is your cup of tea while exploring never ending content (easily over 200 hours worth of game time) where you get to level up and slay dragons, then skyrim is the game for you. well worth every penny.",1
"for a very long time, this is the only game that ive played passed the 70 hour mark. great world and little snippets of story and lore every where. combat is nothing to write home about but the flexibility and mods allows freedom to enjoy what you want from the game.",1
"possibly the best game i have ever played! the gameplay is great, graphics are great, and the gameplay goes on forever! and if you get bored with the storyline, you can go get one of its dlcs! five out of five!",1
"its the most epic game ive ever played! worth every penny of price! huuuge world with so much to do, i think that every one must see skyrim. evrything in this game is amazing: graphics, music, living and authentic world, magic, combat, dragons, shouting and a lot of most beautiful places in games history! seriously, i played many games, i love either morrowind and oblivion, but skyrim... simply knockout its older brothers! i cant even imagine game that deserve more on max rate! if you call yourself a gamer and you dont have skyrim, then simply youre not.",1
"ive spent lots of time in skyrim and have done pretty much everything there is to do, from finding long-lost swords to taming dragons. very immersive and a good waster of your life. :) 10/10 - amazing!",2
"the greatest adventure youll ever go on in a video game.",2
"im still new to this game and i cant stop playin it so much fun alot of things that u can do :d u also dont need a beastly pc to run it my pc specs are gtx 760 and an i5 i play on ultra and full reso i get 100/60+ fps !!!",1
"almost 3 years later, and im still playing skyrim almost every day with no end in sight. tes universe never gets old. it is and always will be *the* greatest series of heroic/high fantasy games i have ever played.",3
"in my experience, words fail to comprehend the grand freedom skyrim offers to players... not to mention its incredible stance towards modding: it will welcome any and all mods, as long as they dont mess up the game engine ;) really worth buying if youre into rpgs.... but also if you just like to hack n slash your way through a grand game world",2
"this game is a singleplayer rpg game. its full of dragons,trolls,wolfs etc i would recommend this game it is very time comsuming but worth it you can cast spells and find bows,daggers,swords,battle axes,maces and so much more!",1
"damn this game is big. massive gameplay for your buck right here.",1
"the most awesome game ever, also happens to be one of the only ones i play, ever.",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. beautiful open world to explore and incredible replayability.",2
"absolutely brilliant rpg. very open game. beautiful to behold, and so much fun just to explore the world. brilliant. just brilliant. only problem is it is not multiplayer.",1

"so much fun, get hearthfire dlc to make your own house and adopt childrew",1
"i used to have friends, then i bought skyrim. 10/10",1
"skyrim is a generic cookie clutter action game that is terrible without mods. of course, mods and modders can create a great game from the base game, so i would reccommend it to everyone. great game modded, vanilla is horrific though.",1
"the reviews are right, this game is a must have. i wasnt really into morrowind or oblivion but this game is awesome.",1
"this game is great totally on my top 3. the graphics are good and so is the gameplay, and the modding community is awesome",1
"for some reason when i was trying to play this game when i startn it and it gets on the loading screen it atomatically closes the game it worked before but now its not working?????????????",1
"skyrim is a wonderfully made game, the graphics is awesome looks so realistic. this is by far the best game ive ever bought.",1
"well, bugger, bethesda went and did it again. skyrim makes for a splendid follow-up on the elder scroll franchise, walking proudly in the footsteps of oblivion. whilst updating some of the outdated elements of oblivion, bethesda also does what we all hoped, keeping the elder scroll feeling to the game. did you like the fourth installment of the elder scrolls? then get this. right now.",1
"it is so awesome that if you dont have it you shuldnt be on steam",2
"this is maybe the best rpg game, if not the best game of all time. the map is huge and it has many side quests and random quests and you can really just do whatever, from murdering citizens to riding dragons!",1
"for all you who like rpg games, buy this game. skyrim is easily my second favorite game of all time (sly cooper 3 is 1st). buy skyrim now, its awesome. buy it. buy it. why are you still reading this and not buying it?",1
"i completed my thesis 1 year later than i could of, due to this game.",1
"i spent 120 official hours and much more unofficial hours , got every single achievement in this game and there are still many more amazing things to do and see in this game. 10/10 - i want to go to sleep and wake up 10 years later when theres a co-op feature in this game.",1
"this game will last you forever. hundreds of hours of gameplay even without mods installed. a must-buy for all humans.",1
"the way it is with all bethseda games: beautiful world, great setting, short main storyline, interesting side story, many many sidequests, much to see and much to do - the other side of the coin? bugs - bugs everywhere. glitchin through objects and gettin stuck - npcs glitchin around, quests not starting, some quests become stuck and cant be completed, random ctds and so on - thanks to the community, there are unofficial patches for the game and the dlcs and boy, they are needed - bestheda, one question - what would you do, without the community that loves your games? let me answer that question for you - you would be out of business in 6 months. and for the enhanced game experience, go get yourself a lot of mods. but be careful of the random ctds.",4
"skyrim stands the test of time, unlike other rpgs, as a game with high replayability. thanks to a particularly spectacular and massive modding community, it is impossible to truely be done with skyrim.",1
"skyrim is better than morrowind in more ways than its worse while also being worse than oblivion in more ways than its better",1
"its the best game ever it has first person third person stand box it has evrytrhing but it is a fps killing game ok my pc is bad but i get 10 fps if u are tierd of playing any game or even tierd of playing a sandbox game play this one",1
"when you walk into riverwood. attack the chicken by the gate. and then save. 10/10",1
"i really like this game because of the massive world it holds and with all the mods to make it your own. iv played alot and i really enjoy this game.",2
"amazingly fun game, but it still has its far share of problems. at least the big ones finally got taken care of.",1
"so good game. full of amazing things :) i recommend this game!",1
"skyrim is such a great game! i havent had a decent gaming computer for a long time and now that i have built one i wanted to try playing it on pc, and its true, you havent lived until you play skyrim on pc compared to console. its soooo immersive and there are soooo many different things you can do. i do wish they came out with more dlc for the game but the modding communtiy is spectacular!",1
"this game is amazing its abit slow at first but once you get into it all you cant stop playing, ive wasted so many hours doing just the littlest things from exploring, talking to npcs, crafting/enchanting, buying/selling resources and much more. there are so many things to do in this game from the main story to the misc quests you get from npcs and with the countless amount of mods you can get and the dlcs there is even more things to do. 10/10",1
"this game is huge. mind-bogglingly huge. every time you think youve seen everything, theres always one more side quest youve never seen in an area that youve walked past a hundred times without seeing. skyrim is one of the most addictive single player games out there, and i would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. the dlc is completely unescessary to have a good time, but it adds a lot of entertaining content to the game.",1
"winner of wonder dunks top of 2011 best grames, skyman is truly the finest in side scrolling platformer action, effortlessly combining both time travel and puzzle based level design, fans of games like portal and call of man alike will see that this is the tippest of the top of the gaming world the elder scrolls v: skyrim: super mario brothers 2 gets a solid latte/10",1
"you like dragons? we got em! you like shouting? we got it! you like iron daggers? we got em! you like bugs, glitches and overused memes literally forced out of a redditors  and then beaten like a ing horse? we got plenty of those! so come on down to skyrim to- skyrim.exe has stopped working. windows is looking for a solution to the problem.",1
"the elder scrolls is without a doubt the best rpg series created.",1
"after umming and arhhing about a thumbs up or a thumbs down, honesty got the better of me. yes, the graphics are a delight, but the gameplay is a sticky mud pie, the combat awkward and unresponsive to input controls, there are way too many mini-quests where you have to go out and slay beast or animal and then report back, wasting so much game time on irrelevancies, and the game totally failed on the replay stakes. ive been trying to go through it again, having learnt from the mishaps of the first run, but it is not holding my interest -- quite the opposite. if you just want to roam an endless landscape in awe of the graphic artists, then this is ideal. if you want a play a game at the same time, leave it alone.",1

"you can walk across the country with hundreds of cabbages in your pockets. i highly recommend this adventure.",1
"this game have : scream can be so loud that peoples flies everywhere. giants > dragons. modders make a rally about who will make the first nude mod. so. much. weapons. modders always makes the elders scrolls games 50% more cooler than the game itself. lizards and cats boobs. amazings landscapes. defying gravity horses. cats boobs. racism but its agaisnt elves so its ok ? ice, like hell a lots of it. youre the dragonborn, a legendary warrior but you can get owned by spiders. youre the choosen one but the guards will arrests you if you kill a goat. damn it mansla4y3r. gamer poops did i mentioned that this game have cats boobs ? 11/10 too much ice ign",2
"when you start to wonder how long its been since you talked to your family you know its an amazing game",1
"what more can be said about skyrim that hasnt already been said? after switching over from console, its the same game i always loved: fun, immersive, and incredibly replayable. plus, steam workshop works brilliantly, especially when partnered with the nexus. 10/10 very okay",1
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"one of the best games ive every played i seriously reccomend it buy it now on the sale it 2 pound get it buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"best open world rpg with unmatched atmosphere. unique dungeons, ruins & caves like i have never seen before!",2
"especially with mods this game gives rediculous ammounts of playtime.",1
"an enormous game with seemingly unlimited content. youll find yourself lost in the world of skyrim just as soon as you set your foot in it.",1
"i have only 8 hr in this game so far. starting nice . the enviroment is so good done that you wishes you are living in that world. great gameplay i miss that alot in a few other games. the music is pretty good in this game thought i not like computer games music so mutch. one thing i am getting mad about when you shoot bow. you never get tired when you hold up the bow before fire it as in reall life archer . you getting tired after 25-30 seconds in you arms. hope they gonna fix it. othervise i like the game so far.",1
"im a huge fan of skyrim and my youtube grew off of it. great game!!!!!!",1
"its just amazing. enough said, just buy it. do it. now.",1
"ill admit, at first when i heard of the game it didnt seem as interesting, thought it would be like the rest that claims to be epic when its not. but over time i saw my friends play it, and when i looked it up for a voicepak project i was working on, i was wrong... the game was something i was actually expecting in a game: no ending point, full customization, the ability to fight in 1st person with any weapon, outstanding music, ability to make potions, armor, weapons and food like in mmo games, and a great storyline with many branching quests. all in single player! i never got the dlc yet, but i can already tell itll make the game worth every cent its worth! too addicting. even the mods make the game fun. never gets old with a character with wings. especially if killed by a giant! (flying in the air always cracks me up. xp) screw the 10/10 rating, and even the 20/10 rating... it deserves the 50/10 rating!! best rpg game ever on steam!",4
"this is a really great game. there are a ton of side quests and the open world is pretty big. i even enjoy just walking around the world and exploring. i have over 180 hours of game time and i have enjoyed every minute, heck, i am still discovering new stuff. i highly recommend this game.",1
"hours and hours and hours and hours of entertainment! such a good modding community - get nexus mod manager from off of teh internets and the game gets even better.",1
"if you have been living under a rock for the past 3 years or so, you might not have heard of skyrim, but it is simply a great game. with the right selection of graphical mods (thank the lord for the pc and the ease of installing mods on steam!) it even looks the part of a next-gen game. i normally dont like rpgs because they dont give me much in return for the hundreds of hours you have to sink into it. but this is a game, that not only is an rpg, but it is one of my favorite games. just the amount of detail and vastness put into the world of skyrim is astonishing and awe-inspiring. i have undoubtedly sunk more time into this game than should be advised, but by god i dont regret a second of it.",1
"a very solid title, however this entry to the elder scrolls series is lacking most of its rpg heritage. this makes for a much less rewarding experience especially late into the game. definitely worth playing, as despite its shortfalls it does still have enough redeeming qualities to make it enjoyable.",2
"this game is awesome ! for me, i would say this game is one of the best rpg of all time. if you find some game to kill your time, this game is must buy list .",1
"modded the game so much that i made a character with incredibly huge breasts and sexy looking that would do prostitution around skryim. thanks japanese modders!",1
"not as good as previous morrowind or oblivion. i felt like everything in this game was handed to me on a platter. in morrowind you had to work you but off in order to get anywhere in guilds. in this game, you show up, rescue them, and theyre like oh, even though youre new, and we have people who have been loyal for years, were going to make you the leader. really???? getting the best armor in the game is all really easy, especially once you become adept at slaughtering all those helpless dragons. i gave up on finishing the game. just didnt do it for me.",1
"this game is simply impossible to finish in the heart. i always wonder, if i was in this cave or not. have i been in this willage or not. am i found everything or not. a game that can be played for months i think. and again ask the same questions.",1
"simply fantastic. 9.9/10. two annoying things: 1) the leveling up is a bit unbalanced. at higher levels i became completely unstoppable, smashing dragons in 2 seconds each, even on normal difficulty. cant remember the name of the last dragon but he was also hacked to pieces in no-time; so much for the grand ending. 2) many quests are still repetitive. i can understand that it wouldnt be easy to add even more scripted content, but i am not fully satisfied yet. some quests are also a bit too long, or rather the dungeons or crypts or whatever are too friggin big at times. looking forward to the next one!..",1
"be careful if you get this game it will eat your life it is truly amazing",1
"this is a fun game that would give anybody a good time. you can do a lot of things and its great for people that like this genre. this game is awesome and just plain out epic. i really recommend you get this one.",1
"best fantasy somewhat-sandbox rpg in existence these days. vanilla is a tad bland, but with mods from nexus and steam workshop, this game has given me close to 500 hours of solid enjoyment. no other game in my library has nearly half that time put into it. okay, i digress, oblivion might gain that much, if i can get past the darned vanilla npcs not making me want to retch. dawnguard: good dlc, plenty of story worth the price, wait till you can pick up on a sale though. dragonborn: own the dlc, never played morrowwind, and have not had the chance to sink my teeth into this content just yet. from what ive seen though it has been interesting enough. falksaar: head over to nexus and check this one out, cant really say much more about it here since its unoffical and all that.",3
"basically medieval russia 10/10 would drink mead again",1
"this is one of the best rpgs ever only played for a couple days but already in love everyone should check it out.",1
"are you kidding me? dlcs are more expensive than whole game including dlcs? that is really great of you towards people who bought the game on its release date... not nice! game itself is really good, but this doesnt make me happy...",1
"has always been one of my favorite games and that was on xbox so on pc it only gets better with mods",1
"this game is so good it makes me want to rip off my own testicles and dip them in maranara sause and feed then to a homeless alpaca then go to wal-mart and give a fat man a hug!",1
"dual wielding warrior, an intelligent mage, a back-stabbing theif? want to kill dragons?! this is the game for you! :)",2
"this is by far one of the best rpgs ever made, and getting it on pc is hands down the best choice, there are so many amazing mods that you can turn it into a whole new game 10/10",2
"syrim is one of those games you just have to have if youre into these kind of games. it never gets dull and no matter how many times you have played, you are bound to discover something new. this is one that will never be deleted or whatever, no matter how old it gets. it just draws you in and doesnt release you. i would rather go mad then get rid of this game or stop playing it. there are a lot of crazy mods for this game out there, but i still play the old plain vanilla version and that still suits me perfectly. its a big world out there in skyrim and no matter what kind of gamer you are (thats into this kind of games) you always find something that suits you.",2
"one epic game must buy. why? -fun with / without mods -lores are always surprices -random questions often intriguing, mostly happen during daily routine/ on the way to a dungeon / keep / dwemer ruins / caves -dragons just awesome. -even after world eater defeated - therere still much more to be explored! -definitely a worthy one for achievement hunters - like myself as one.",3
"this is a good game. its a major time killer, so make sure you dont have anything important to do once you start playing. that is all.",1
"well, i played this game about 28 hours, so i think i know enough about this game and its dlcs, so i can write a review. i have played the both games before skyrim, morrowind and oblivion. in my opinion both were awesome games with graphics better than everything bevore them. that is the same in skyrim. also the main story is very good, although its just about 20 hours if you use cheats and dont enjoy it. but you should enjoy it. the main story is full with little details with make the game unforgetable. but the best on every the elder scrolls game is the sidestory. you can be everyone you want to be, you can marry, you can get chhilds and so on. so you should buy it, the price isnt high and you can spend more than 500 hours without getting it boring. trust me",1
"loved this game back when it first came out played it on a xbox. the game never gets boring for me as you can play with an infinite number of types of class with the make your own class in effect system and you can install mods to make the new experience even better 10/10.",1
"this game is incredibly immersive and has so much gameplay. i especially reccomend getting the expansions.",1
"i dont need a reason to recommend this game...just play it.",1
"skyrim is like a music album that has a few tracks that you arent particularly fond of, but the rest of the music is pure aural blliss that you cant help but think of the album as close to perfection as possible.",1
"great game, many fun, much cool! i love this game! needs to let u have multiple characters so one of your characters can be a mage and outher one can be a warrior! plz add this!",1
"the story if horrific but the fun in the sandbox world is unmatched.",1
"my favorite rpg. pros: - great story. - long gameplay. - allows mods. - very addicting. cons: - none.",1
"i cant help but come back to this game after the massive disappointment of elder scrolls online and wish they had worked using skyrim instead of oblivion as the foundation. such a vastly superior game, its sad i feel more of a connection with the ai in this game than the players in eso.",1
"if this game was a potato, it would be a great potato.",1
"i played the non-steam version before, i bought it when its up on sale. next time elder scroll release their new title, im buying without considering testing the non-genuine version :)",1
"one of the most moddable games outside of quake. -combined with almost limitless replayability, even with a vanilla save, the game will last you for untold amounts of hours. combat is a little clunky sometimes, but this is one game you probably owe yourself to playthrough once. #wabbajack",1
"amazing. a must have for anyone interested in gaming. make sure to check out the mods too as they can add infinite replayability and fix problems with the original release (lack of dynamic civil war etc).",1
"best mountain climbing sim ever! if you dont like mountain climbing, dont worry because im pretty sure there are other things to do too.",2
"love it! one of the favorites in my list. also has an awesome selection of mods to keep it interesting :)",1
"good god!!! love it love it love it!!! you can do almost anythig you want in this game, but the mods truly make the game what it is, an endless playground for you, plus theres the dragon fights, being the dragonborn hero, shouting people into oblivion, listening to an idiot and thinkin ive heard enough, just die, i mean you need this game, yesterday on it i punched a rabbit and drop kicked a fox, wha else could one possibly need i ask you......go forth and do what i have not (yet) and headbutt a goat! (lolz)",2
"beautiful game but pretty challenging..if you have the time and the effort its totally worth it",1
"love it, just wish i could commit to on character type",4
"i absolutely love this game, it truly lives up to the expections i had from the elder scrolls iv: oblivion, if not surpasses them. personally speaking, this is my favourite game i have ever played. ive always loved the free will you get from sandbox games, and skyrim is about as free as it gets! i love how bethesda acknowledges their human nature and allows for the game owner to easily create mods to add on to their games by offering a free program to do so with, the creation kit, or add mods made by the modding community with just as much ease. i give skyrim a 9001 out of 10 rating! thank you bethesda!!! ill play skyrim until i die from playing too much skyrim! skyrim!!!",2
"buggy and crashy as only bethesda games can be. wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle. still running on the engine they used in 2001, even if they renamed it. if you dont get a crash to desktop, youre doing it wrong. still a lot of fun.",2
"skyrim is an amazing game. ive put 109 hours into this masterpiece and do not regret it. the story is a bit short imo but the side missions and the open world bring you a whole lot of stuff to do. run up mountains. enter dungeons / caves. ride a horse. kill a dragon. buy a house. get married. etc. and btw, 10/10 for using consolecommands and changing my name into jesus and flying up to the skies. edit: played a bit of skyrim last night, went on a horse. and had the power to fly...incredible 11/10",1
"what is there to say, other than that this is one of the greatest games of this genre and potentially the best game of the year? learning from the formulas of their previous elder scrolls games (as well as from fallout 3), bethesda has put together the pinnacle of the open world exploration/fantasy game. whether you desire to do battle with dragons, conquor lands in the name of an empire, seek out treasure in ruins or just simple wanderlust, the overwhelming amount of options available to you in terms of how to play and what there is to do and see is staggering. absolutely phenomenal. everyone has to play this game.",1
"i really love this game! i recently started playing again. started playing with the bow!!! wow its so fun!! but i wish bethesda would add portuguese as language... i believe there is a horde of braziillians who would love this game even more if their language was available qq",1
"this game is amazing and if you dont have it you should get it and if you dont want to get it then i totally respect that but you are missing out on a lot of fun and frustration good day bye",1
"f***ing amazing. cant get enough. when i first got it, i saw the sunrise every day for a week straight. i think i might have skipped all my classes... its kind of a blur.",2
"skyrim is a game of great fun, its really a good game that can last you hours and hours but it falls prey to what many rpgs and mmos fall snare to and that is it just has to much for some people and just spread so far out that it can become tedious, that problem i suffer to from this game but from what time i did play of it i enjoyed. i can really recomend this game to my freinds that are into the elder scrolls series and games similar but ins really something worth mentioning to someone that arent really bortherd about that type of game, there is no wow factor in this game after you have seen the fisrt couple of hours of the game. what really has lead this game to survive on the pc markey however is the modding community, which has really just kept this game going and alive which withought the community it wouldnt alive today. i think this game definetly deserves a 7/10 but i gurantee you that you can find a modd to make youre experience even better and gretaer than the vinilla version of the game.",1
"as with any of bethesdas developments under the elder scrolls franchise skyrim does not disappoint. pros: exceptional gameplay quick, and painless installation, with adjustable settings depending on your machine endless hours spent on quests, and other enjoyable activities great downloadable content to spice the game up. heaps and loads of mods created by players to further enjoy your play time cons: like all current elder scrolls games the adventure is journeyed alone in single-player.(wait for elder scrolls online for that though!)",1
"i cant play this game further than the tutorial, the combat is just way too clunky and lacks any strategy or skill. my character even flails his dagger about like its a hammer, do you realise how dangerous that would be for you in a real fight. the world is drab and uninteresting, and its people lifeless.",1
"steps to enjoying this game! -have a powerful pc -know how to install mods -know how to use the skyrim nexus website -dont pick a khajiit oh you mean will you enjoy the game? its okay we all ask silly questions now and again! 11/10 - would serve to gaben on a plate",2
"say goodbye to your life, friends, and family. this game is amazing :)",1

"the elder scrollls:skyrim its an epic adventure trough the land of skyrim... often im asked what`s the best weapons armour, my answer to that is: that all depends on your point of wiew my friend if you wanna be stealthy i can craft you the finest dagger in all of skyrim, if you want to be strong i can craft you the finest battleaxe, if you wanna be a mage or maybe an archer i can craft you the most powerfull staff and bow, you can hunt for food,fish,steal,buy your food if you want you can choose to do sidequest or mainquest and learn power of the voice... you feel sleepy? then find a village or maybe a city and an inn with beds, or are you looking for an adventure heh if you are you can just talk to people and ask for quest or you can just find your own adventure need money heh then you can be stealthy and pickpocket people or do quest and claim you reward or sell stuff you dont need go to dungeons find chests loot bodies slay your enemies or be nice to them and get allies backstab people learn how to transform to a werefolf and eat your foes, get ambushed by bandits, fight the most eoic creature ever lived... dragon kill it loot its body take dragon bones and scales so if you wanna be strong craft dragon bone armour and fight kill and slay epic monsters in the hole world...this is skyrim... this is an epic adventure...",2

"very nice game. start on lower diffuculty though unless you like being sent to a loading screen every 15 min.",1
"great replay value, multiple story arcs to discover, and hours of entertainment. you can follow the main storyline or simply explore the vast world of tamriel.",3
"amazingly fun, very easy to mod, and easy to make mods with the creation kit, buy it! its worth the money.",1
"this is a game that no one has ever heard about, just kidding. great game, good follow up after oblivion and never gets old. even if it does get old, theres hundreds of mods",1
"brilliant game, one of my favourites. once you get into the game its hard to stop playing as it feels like youre actually there walking around personally. lovely graphics with amazing gameplay. i would recommend to anyone thinking about purchasing the game. you can spend hour galore exploring skyrim, the fun never ends! id pay 100 for this game with the sheer amount of fun and pleasure its given me over the years.",1
"one of my top favs of all time. a king along games. you are really missing out if you have not played this game.",2
"this game has great lore, indepth open-world, fun and powerful questlines...the list goes on. if youre looking for a great roleplay game, this is one you will want to have in your library. the dlcs are also low price and very expanding of the world and of game play. the modding community also takes great care in updating and maintaining their content. this is a game with a very dedicated community that i personally love and i hope you woill love as well.",1
"this game is not worth all the buzz, is overrated, and generally a waste of money. 3/10",1
"the best rpg that ive played in a long time. very beautiful and a perfect game for mods. amazing 10/10. its a steal while its on sale.",1
"what else needs to be said about this game other than its freaking awesome!!! best graphics for an tes game and the story isnt half bad either. one of the best sandbox games ive ever played!",2
"this game es amazering. i wood sayz spendz all the monies on its.",1
"[story]  [gameplay]  [replayability]  [gameplay hours] 50+ skyrim is open world rpg that puts players into the role of the legendary dragonborn. as expected of other elder scroll games, there are plenty of sidequests, caverns, and dungeons to explore alongside the epic main storyline. an active mod community ensures exciting and new experiences with every playthrough. players are encouraged to try out different approaches to both combat and character progression. with vast amount of content and freedom, skyrim is one of the best rpgs of 2011.",1
"pretty overrated but still a great game, a satisfying experience for the rpg hungry, nothing at all to regret here",1
"really good rpg but i do miss the repair features from the previous game oblivion.",1
"great game, although not as good as morrowind. still an acceptable entry into the scrolls games.",1
"i love games that give you total freedom to do whatever and anything you please. i can mod the crap out of it and even do other quest before the main. i have played and loved both elder scrolls oblivion and this one. if you get it for pc you can get mods to increase the already decent graphics. anyone who has not tried an elder scrolls game should and needs to try skyrim. the dlc dawngaurd is also a major must have. it adds more quest as well as improved vampires/werewolfs/others. i just love the game so much. i am one of those people who spends hours just customizting in character creations. which adds on to the fact they have mods to increase races and other cosmedics.",2
"awesome awesome awesome i love skyrim. this game is magnificent not only is this game great but the mods just take the game to new heights. i really recomend buying this game and downloading lots of awesome mods.",1
"skyrim is a fantastic game, and newcomers to the series will no doubt be enthralled by it. veterans of the series may find it lacking in comparison to the past titles, depth wise. its still a fantastic game.",1
"best betsada game ever! if you love rpgs like me and occationaly fictional creatures and middleage time settings i bet you would love this game to!",1
"i used to play other games; but then i took a skyrim in the knee.",1
"though it has a lot of bugs, i still love this game.",4
"who doesnt want to kill dragons and get all the loot :)",1
"awesome game! hours and hours of gameplay, lots of missions and side quests. 5 stars out of 5",2
"why the  are you here? theres an add to cart button for this product, just saying.....",1
"this is a game in the series of elder scrolls. a game where you can be a werewolf, fight a war, steal and kill, and is one of the very best games of this generation (my opinion)... this it the elder scrolls v skyrim!",1
"i can only imagine the face of the guard that was witnessing some random individual in front of him changes sexes and races within seconds for maybe 2 hours straight without interference.",1
"this game was alright, but it just fell short in too many ways. without mods the game quickly grows stale and nothing you really do feels like it has any impact on the world. just became leader of nearly every faction you possibly could ontop of being the dragonborn? nobody reacts. dont know any magic? no problem, become leader of the mages college anyway. my immersion was constantly broken ontop of being quite annoyed at the game being 90% draugr dungeons which really got boring after the 10th time. its not that the game is bad, and with mods it becomes a lot more enjoyable, there are just way better games if youre looking for an rpg experience and there are also far better games if youre looking for more of an action experience.",1
"much like its predecessors skyrim is your typical well rounded and polished elder scrolls game. its a lot of fun, its pretty and it has a good story.",1
"im not quite sure whether i have written a review of this game or not and i honestly couldnt care less. i have spent hundreds of hours playing this game alot of it was offline some of it was online and dont even get me started on the countless hours i have spent modding this game to look good and better and what not. i love skyrim its like a drug that satisfies you and keeps you wanting more after long periods of time away from the game you get angry and upset for not having it there to play at a miniscule amount of time. i myself am in love with this game and its ancestors (not literaly) among the elder scrolls franchise. so if you are on the fence about skyrim you shouldnt be bcause skyrim is most definitely a well worth the money and time kind of game if you are a true die hard fan also the negative reviews you hear from people not on steam but on like ps3 and xbox 6/5 times are cod players.anyway this is a good game 11/10 ign would fap again.",1
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",1
"wait, i have over 870 hours played? what, how? this can only be a good game.",4
"amazing game, countless hours of fun to be had, if you dont have it, get it!",1
"ive only been playing for a while but... its a great game and im sure more fun is going to come :))",1
"the game is amazing, fun and addictive. could have been better if there wasnt spiders in the begining because of how popular aracnophobia is these days. i literally had to squint my eyes to finish the first part.",1
"this is a groundbreaking game. graphics and environmental detail are astonishing on max settings. comparing this game to oblivion and its expansions is difficult. yes i like the graphics, and the game, however, once the player reaches level 35 or so, the game becomes boring. this is because the enemies you face do not change with level as in oblivion. many of the quests give better gear than the dungeon loot which makes them pointless. hope you like killing zombies time and time and time again.",1
"breathtaking immersion, wonderful graphics, and endlessly fun gameplay makes this game a prize to own. there are some problems with it, though. to start with, the immersion is so complete, youre disappointed when a feature isnt there, like when a character cant talk with you. secondly, the wonder that encompasses gameplay the first time round just isnt there in later saves, and this can be a huge loss for such an awe-inspiring game. however, if youre willing to try out mods, theres no end to the content you can find. the final issue is how combat and even other skills can become incredibly unbalanced in the latter part of the game. my answer to this is, once again, mods. the community has done an excellent job of rebalancing the game. and any of these slight problems pales in comparison to the wonder and glee that will fill you when you kill your first troll, or join the companions, or successfully evade a way-too-powerful-for-you dragon. this is one of the greatest games i own, no doubt about it.",2
"no words for such an amazing game fun for the whole family",1
"i loved the game so much, neat graphics. neat story. good animation, and story, but its remindes me of cod:mw, just without guns, go to a, from there go to b and get c. but its fun. because its a fresh thing. in here you can go to some directions, like go to jail and break out, if you dont want to, [because if you did go to jail you lose all of your stuff] so you can just roll back while auto-saving. the game has a secret message of peace, if you go with power when you speak to people, you will get screwed. whell i really enjoyed my first hours in the game. totally recommend.",1
"best freeroam and adventure game evar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"awesome game, awesome storyline, awesome side quests, awesome skins,weapons, awesome graphics, awesome dialogues, awesome open world landscape.. tes v skyrim is an epic game and i recommend it to anyone that likes this kind of games.. its a fantastic game!!",1
"the elder scrolls series is epic in its awesomeness. skyrim is a masterpiece of rpg games. morrowind, oblivion, and now skyrim all are kings of their repsective time periods for rpg games. a must play for anyone who loves emersive games that suck hours upon hours from your life.",1
"the fifth edition of the elder scrolls was a big hit and its just amazing compared to former games from bethesda. it does cost quite alot of money but its worth it. if you buy the game and need tips or any good mods, friend me on steam (zero) and ill help you to the best of my abillity. i personally recommend the elder scrolls:skyrim to anyone above 7 years of age.",2
"used unrelenting foced on lydia from the top of the throat of the world. found her the next day in a creek. 11/10",2
"well, i had this game on xbox 360, but it felt short. i bought this mainly because of mods.it makes the game way better.",1
"this game....is the  100/10...okey 90/10...dahm glitches...",1
"modded the hell out of it. completely changed the game. 10/10 would play fallout 3 again",1
"took too many arrows in my knee but managed to climb a mountain with my horse. 11/10 would play again.",1
"this is a great game with weeks of gameplay. it is definitely a game i recommend",1
"this game is maybee one of the best installments of the elder scrolls series, it has the best story of them all, and the best all around gameplay. the one thing that sets the game apart from all of the others is that it has the most roleplay capabilities that i have ever seen. themost distinctive and recognizeable part of the game is the experiences that you will never see anywhere else, other than solstheim!",2
"your social life is now going into whiterun and talking to nazeem",2
"there is nothing to write... you have to play this game! this is awesome - lots of quests, armoury, many characters to do, open world, spells, alchemy, enchanting, damn! if this is too little for you, theres 2 dlcs, big dlc - great dlcs! new world, new history, more characters, if u didnt play, you have to hate rpgs. great game! good job bethesda!",2
"this is an absolute fantastic game. the story and side quests never get boring, and if they do you can always add something from the workshop to make it a bit more fun. i lose track of time when playing because the game itself is just so mind blowing. this is an absolute must when you are bored and looking for a game to play. there seems to be endless possibilities on what ever adventure you wish to choose.",1
"i think this is interesting game. i like how the combat isnt guaranting a blow will land or that it will hit the particular target you aimed it at. i also like the perk system for improving abilities by your choice.",1
"great game (even though its single-player). great lore and storyline, when you completed most of the game its always fun to start messing round with mods. :d very addictive.",4
"make all your dreams come true with mods. 11/10, i use to be an adventurer like you, but sadly i dropped out of highschool to take care of my wife and child and have a really bad skooma problem.",2
"oh skyrim how i love thee, let me count the ways.... 140+ hours of gameplay, 49 out of 50 achievements!!",1
"i love this game its awesome you can explore add mods and just fun buy ledgendary and you will get all the dlcs cheaper",1
"one of the best rpg games currently existing, months of gaming and a big open world with lots of random events like assasins, thieves, mages, insane people (sheogorath) and with the dlcs u get vampires and cult members",1
"great game. why? you can do anything you want from becoming the one person that saves the world to killing pregnant women and kids",1
"skyrim is a well executed epic open world rpg with stunning graphics and great story. i would highly recommend this game as you can get tons of play time out of it. the only issues i had with the game were as follows. 1) like some of bethesdas other games, this one can; and i say can not will, have crashing issues with save files being corrupted. 2) the combat system while being robust, isnt as robust as it was in previous elder scrolls titles. however, you shouldnt let these two things deter you, the crashes dont happen to everyone, and the combat system is still great. plus, if you include all the dlc and the workshop mods, this game has nearly limitless content. well worth anyones time.",1
"by far... the best -open world game- ever played !!! and enjoyed also a lot of very good mods. big thanks to the devs and the great mod-makers ! 9,5/10 !!!",3
"it is certainly true that skyrim is much, much better on the pc rather than on the consoles. why? 1 word. mods~ there are many, many, many, many mods all over the internet. besides, the gameplay is pretty good as well. as far as im concerned, this would be rated at a 9.75/10. its pretty good, but not my absolute favorite game. still, its good!",1
"skyrim is not one of my favorite games, oblivion (the game before skyrim) is my all-time favorite game, but that doesnt mean skyrim isnt worth every penny!",1
"the biggest and best open-world game ive played so far, and ive tried many. the number of missions, places, characters and stories is limitless. the game can devour you, and it will. beautiful graphics, a+ character customization, lots of fun. the only flip side is the length and monotonity of the dungeon missions. have you tried to finish off san andreas to 100%? that was a cakewalk compared to skyrim.",1
"miss hit the guard when trying to kill a dragon ... get a bounty points 13/10",1
"what can i even begin to say about this game that hasnt already been said? bar none, one of greatest rpgs ever released. nearly endless in its vanilla form, if you mod it out, it really is the fantasy world that never ends. gaming, storytelling and immersion doesnt get much better than this. buy it. wait for the legendary edition to go on sale and pick it up for a song. mod it. there are endless possibilities and it is much easier than you think. enjoy one of the greatest gaming experiences of the modern age.",1
"one of the best single player open world rpgs in my opinion. a few things could have been done better, but overall i really enjoy it... maybe too much seeing as how i have logged over 600 hours on my xbox version.",2
"what can i say about skyrim at this point that hasnt been said already? there are still times, over two years since release, that i find myself wanting to go back and play. i dont discover something new every time, but there are certainly still discoveries to be made.",1
"i played skyrim approximately 900 hours on ps3 without any of the add-ons before it started losing its appeal. when i bought the legendary pack on steam, i dove right in and am just as addicted to the game as the first time i played it. the game can be extremely tedious sometimes, especially for loot hoarders and people get killed a lot. the graphics are extremely adjustable and therefore are only limited by your hardware. the musical score has an impeccable range and leveling up and learning a word of power become unforgettable melodies. the main story line is intense, although a bit short. the real story is completing all of the side quests and conquering all of the dungeons. there is a fairly good balance in the explorable areas but when i finished the biggest and best dungeon, i realized none of the others mattered. i just wanted more of that one. the combat system is not very unique but manageable. overall, this game is a good buy.",1
"mastered alchemy, enchanting, and smithing. instantly became the most powerful character in all of tamriel. who needs a large pool of magicka when your armor allows for unlimited spells and no cool down time? ultra powerful weapons and armor with enchants and potions. stronger enchantments when using potions. stronger potions when using enchants. 15/10 easy. oohhh, and you can role-play... if thats more your thing. collect all the cheese wheels and sweet rolls!!!!!!!!!!! shame evey door means a long loading screen. thats where exactly half of my playing time has been has been dedicated.",1
"the appeal of skyrim is its immersive open world that offers countless hours of exploration and questing. compared to older entries, the gameplay has been streamlined for a casual approach. constant micromanagement of attributes and preplanning of skill advancement is a thing of the past and you can just play without the worry of accidentally ending up with a dud character. while skyrim offers arguably the most enjoyable gameplay of the series, it lacks the depth of morrowind and has much weaker questlines than oblivion. the ui is also frustratingly atrocious. thankfully, the thriving mod community can address these fallacies and allows you to literally tailor the game to however you want. skyui and the unofficial patches are addons that everyone should get regardless of how they play.",2
"this is just a great game. ive played it about 15 times but havent actually finished it once because its so immersive and theres so much to do.",1
"theres a mod that turns dragons into thomas the tank engine",1
"this game is awsome and with all the weapons and all the things to explore the fun is endless with all the work they put into it its amazing you sould play it.",1
"this i say is one of the best games ever there is so much u can do ther are lots of bosses and its just amazing,this game is just the game that everybody has been waiting for!",1
"i wanna die and be reborn in skyrim. thats how much i love it.",1
"had more fun in morrowind. but its the elder scrolls.",1
"havent even completed it yet. but with 96hrs into the game it is the best game of the year by far. i seriously recommend this if you enjoy fallout 3/ new vegas or the elder scrolls series.",1
"great game open world more time i want to play it to clear all mission , awesome it more more mission to play this game has real life ...",1
"this is a great game. but there is always a ing mountain in the way.",1
"why do people like this game? an rpg is about actual story and the choices you make and leveling up your character. none of this makes any difference and no choices in any factions mke any difference to your non-existent storyline. worst of all you wander for 2 hours just getting to your destination so that you maybe get there. major time waster.",1
"so far most of my reivews on pc games are written shortly after games releases: to offer insight and recommendation for those who are on the fence about whether the game is worth playing/ buying. skyrim has been released for more than 2 years, it is one if the most popular games so far and almost everyone who calls themself a gamer owns the game. so why bother write a review at all? well, firstly i believe what defines a successful game does not only lie in how many copies were sold or how high the ratings were given by the ign (duh!) i am writing this in hindsight to show how much impact this game, compared to its earlier franchise, has changed the indulstry. all the simple details on the scale of the game, the open world and various immersive tasks leading one character from a convict to a hero, they have all been examined in full detail. mods are rated as extensions of the game and even play styles inspire gamers to start over as a pure illusionist (thanks pcgamer). what more can be said? it is simply a great game with endless possibilities and each playthrough offering an entirely new experience. more importantly this review serves as a constant reminder to me of what modern pc gaming could achieve, as publishers strive to push graphics and engines to the next-gen standard; let us not forget how much replayablity and game style can result in miracles.",1
"i have a friend that literially took an arrow to the knee. and this...... was his story",1
"im a huge fan of skyrim and my youtube grew off of it. great game!!!!!!",1
"this game is one of my favorite games and plus there are many mods to make the game more fun!",2
"so lets get into a real review. of course this is an amazing game. you should buy it before any other elder scrolls, the main story is greatly tied together with the civil war going on in skyrim. i love this game and yes i recommend it.",2
"my prelimenary opinion would be that this game is even more awesome than the ones that came before. i was a big gamer when it came to oblivion and i do miss some of the pleasant features of that game in the skyrim gameplay. luckely, in my opinion, the conversationwheel was parted with. a big plus for skyrim is the smithing-feature as are the dragons obviously and the medieval, scandinavian, mythological feeling in-game. regarding to the use of magic, i think it was a great move on the part of the developpers to go with these shouts...very well done. each factions, race, etc. is now even more diverse than in previous games. a big point of critique is that bethesda still has a lot men and women in the game talking in the same voice (but of course it is obvious as to why that is so). the vanilla world map could use some improvement, if you are against using mods for this. as a big fan over the series, i think a 9 out of 10 (with oblivion being 8,5 and morrowind a 7) is an appropriate mark for the elder scrolls v skyrim.",1
"decent game, but the pc version isnt without console-ridden features that annoy mouse/keyboard users like myself. hopefully a modder will address this issue. skyrim in no way threatens morrowind goty as my all-time favorite elder scrolls game. there is some fun to be had in skyrim but be warned its very streamlined and built for the masses instead of niche open world rpg lovers specifically. the price at $60 is a bit steep but you can get many hours out of this game, despite bugs and streamlining, and numerous annoying console-esque run-ins with the interface/menu.",4
"skyrim, making giants follow you into the mountains so that you can shout them off. 10/10",1
"its a really good game to spent your time with because its good for those who like adventure",1
"wey 2 open wurld, i got lust nd i luk at mep i wus 938389494839408302304898947897478974994 fet awey frum my houz i was only gon for 3 mins doe?",1
"awesome game and its open world!. you can do wutever you want. you can get married you can slay dragons you can become a vampire you can steal things or even sleep in inns. great game and you can approach a quest how you want. you dont even have to do quests! so i reccomnd this.",1
"very fun and extreamly moddable game, if you dont own it yet best pick up the legendary edition for all the dlc ect.",3
"another great game of the elder scrools series. skyrim is much more than just another rpg, it is a deep, packed and customizable roleplaying experience. whats better than journeying through icy mountains, returning with a pile of loot, bring that pile to your home, then storing it and doing some redecorations to your house while your companion watches your back. and there is plenty to do, the world is simply huge and populated with all kinds of evil, whose goal it is to murder you in your sleep. the game has its flaws, bugs and glitches are common, but much less than in oblivion, and some gameplay elements feel a bit stale after a while, but thats why we have a massive modding community, which fixes and expands the world of skyrim every day. to conclude, skyrim is a enourmous game, with content that grasps you and after 20+ hours it is still hard to resist to this grasp, especially with a good modpack to iron out the missing stuff. 9/10",1
"your social life is now going into whiterun and talking to nazeem",2
"this is by far one of the best rpgs created with 273 quests this game is a must buy.",1
"its skyrim. i shouldnt even have to review it. you already know how good it is.",1
"the sequel to oblivion. it easily lives up to its predecessor, and its significantly less buggy!",1
"if you like adventure this one is for you. best rpg ever",1
"what can i say about this game, if you havent played it get it, the dlc and mods available for it really enhance the graphics and gameplay more. a must have for your collection no doubt.",2
"so i played this game on console and completed, after getting my pc and loving it so much on the xbox, i decided, why not get this on pc with the graphics improvements and increased frame rate potentials, plus which is a huge plus, the modding potential for this game. it is absolutely fantastic and the mods just add to what is one of th best games on the steam store. a definite must buy for all rpg fans! please do not miss out on this experience!",1
"this is one of those games where you think crack would be less addicting. ive wasted hours of my life playing this game and i think it was worth it! this is easily one of the best games ive ever played!, there are tons of workshop items, dlcs, and most of all, fun to be had! i really recomend picking up this game if you have too much time on your hands. dont be afraid to try oblivion either, its not as good in my opinion but its still a pretty good game.",1
"this is by far one of my favorite games ever! so much to do theres just hundreds of hours of playing time. the main quest is only the beginning of this game! very fun and amazing game.",1
"very awesome game cant put it down. easy moding and with developer controls its very hard to beat.",1
"downloaded a mod that lets my character put naked chicks on a torture rack and plow them 11/10",1
"got to lvl 70. forgot to save after adding too many mods. game crashed. had to start new game. 10/dragons will play again",1
"this game is awesome. you get to play as a slayer of dragons in the province of skyrim. dragons appear after centuries and there just happens to be a civilian war at the same time. good idea and, the opposite of most todays games, actually well executed. but the main advantage of this game (besides its lore) its that you can do anything. ever heard for a phrase skyrim can do that? well it exists for a reason. let me highlight some of the features skyrim has: -can use magic -can buy horses -can buy houses -can build houses -can become a vampire/werewolf -can catch fish -can have a garden -can kill dragons -can fight in a war -can shoot catapults -can become a thief -can become an assassin -can cook stuff -can have a library -can marry npc -can adopt children -can go into certain daedric realms (kinda like heavens and hell irl i suppose) -can shade the sun -can listen to guards but seriously the game is awesome and worth every euro/dollar/any currency. specially the legendary edition mods and console commands are a whole new thing and provide even more stuff to mess with.",1
"awesome game, easy to run and doesnt take an amazing pc to play 10/10",1
"one of the best rpgs ever! if you like bethesda or open world gaming, youll love skyrim.",1
"in skyrim, you can defy the laws of gravity, send isaac newton the good ol finger! fly horses off cliffs at distances you would never believe! jump up the sides of mountains where in real life, you would probably be gravitying to the ground! the only thing we forgot to add is a  you isaac newton line for whenever you perform one of these anti-newtonist feats! god i love this game. get it for the love of god. 10/10 would defy gravity again.",2
"if you ever just want to lose yourself in a huge  world with a million things to do and a million other more places to go and are a kleptomaniac. god help you.",2
"another great title added into the elder scrolls! i would recommend getting nexus mod manager, and incorporating a few mods into the game, as that tends to give it that new game feel and keeps you interested longer. not that its a boring game, but once you have beaten most of the quests, you can actually get mods that give you even more quests.",1
"mods mods mods. still discovering new things and with mods completely changes the game",1
"skyrim is both the best game i have ever played and the worst. i have done so much debugging with consol that i think i should work for bethesda.",2
"how to begin? i started playing skyrim on xbox 360 back in 2011 christmas when i was still a console peasant, and boy did i not see the sunlight ever again, massive huge world, so much to do, never bored whatsoever, the storyline is average to good, not as immersive and gripping as oblivion, but to make up for it is the multiple dialogue choices you can choose during this, compared to oblivion with limited answers. the graphics are awesome too, they have slightly looked a little worse as time went by and advancements have been made, but with a few mods on pc, in which i got skyrim in early 2013, its very worth it, there is also so much playback value with the side quests and the character specialities, such as mage, thief and warrior, or even a hybrid of those classes. however the few downsides i have seen is its really poor engine and its lod, and how the water on the game looks so crap in the distance, and also how it is quite badly optimized, so even the beefiest of rigs will kneel before having an enb mod or something in that nature. overall, my favourite es game in the series, basically tied with oblivion. such an engrossing and amazing game, truly. so excited for es6, these games never fail to make me not sleep at night with the excitement of its release.",1
"im just doing this so i can level up.....but badass game though",1
"skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played in my whole entire life. right behind star wars battlefront ii ;). this game has soooooo many things to do on it. just like in oblvion or even fallout 3/new vegas. perfect game! i always enjoy this game and it is so hard to find things that is bad about this game! there are a few bugs, of course, what game doesnt have bugs. the legendary edition contains all of the dlc that is totally worth it! none of the dlc is bad at all! good job bethesda :)",1
"skyrim is a must have game for all gamers. it is the most detailed game world ever, and is host to any playstyle imaginable. cant wait for elder scrolls vi",2
"great game ,good graphics,fast, allways somthing to do,if it does get a bit boring=solution=mods!!!!",1
"so i originally had this game on my xbox 360 since the first day it was released. but two days ago i decided to re-purachse it for my pc and i have no regrets what so ever, the game is alot better on pc in all ways. and if you cant really be bothered downloading mods off of a website like me, you can just get them through steam workshop by simply subscribing to the selected mod. would reccomend this game to anyone who likes rpgs, fantasy or just swinging swords about.",1
"amazing game. 150hrs plus spent playing. still not completed everything. 9.5/10. would be 10 but too many dragons trying to hunt me down.",1
"this game is amazing! so much freedom to do whatever! a must own!",1
"still havent even scratched the surface of this game. 83 hours in and i barely know what the names of friends and citys are? now thats a good time killer.",1
"great immersive world, but with a few problems regarding the downsizing of the spell and ability systems in some ways from prior games. overall, amazing game.",1
"talk about bang for your buck. i got skyrim for the ps3 back when it came out and also got all the dlc. i put in 200+ hrs. when i upgraded my pc i got skyrim. i have put in 30+ hrs. with all the money i put in this game i am still very happy!",1
"elder scrolls always provides the ultimate rpg experience in terms of replayability and skyrim is no exception. it also provides one of the freest game environments, you can do pretty much whatever you want, and the full game experience is not defined by completion of the story. very strong modding tools and a very strong modding community that creates the best user made content of any game.",2
"i keep telling myself that i hate this game, yet i keep finding myself coming back to play it every once in awhile.",2
"a game that many people have lost countless hours of their days to, and one that rightly deserves them. so fat the only gripe i have with this game is that when im playing batman enemies see a corpse, run to it and search a small area for a bit, then just say ah  it, i never liked that guy anyways. if batman entered your  cave, started picking off all of your buddies, you would be  your pants and praying to all the elder gods that he doesnt kill you too. not just giving up and going back to bed.",3
"skyrim is the best rpg game i have ever played. the game is almost endless and the adventures are amazing. i fully recommend this game.",2
"immersive world, great gameplay and great community support. get this game!",2
"awesome game, just hrs and hrs of gameply play and almost no end.",1
"skyrim is a great game. i love it, but it isnt fast or overly difficult. consider modding the game to high-heaven en enjoy some great community-made stuff too.",4
"all my wife cooks is pie! so i killed her in front of the kids as a lesson! now they will never eat pie!!! and my new wife will not clean up her body! now that she is dead all i want is pie! buy this game if you cry every time! if not for me for the pie!",1
"see those mountains? you can go there. welcome to skyrim, its amazing.",1
"probably the greatest video game that will ever be created. if you do not own this and have not played morrowind... well you just suck at life.",1
"definitely worth the money, if you enjoy open world experiences. plenty here for hundreds of hours of gameplay.",2
"amazing game. if your computer can handle it, the graphics look amazing. i would not recommend playing vanilla, add some mods! spice it up a bit! the gameplay is good, controls are good, has 1 to 1 headtracking. hours and hours of fun. if you are reading this and you have completed every quest in skyrim ever, i congratulate you. if you have just bought skyrim, i encourage you to finish the main questline at your own pace, not right away. anways, the game is great, totally worth the money.",1
"why are you reading this review when you can be playing this game??",2
"my favorite game of all time, the moding community are amazing and make some of the best content i have ever seen even compared to the besthesda scriptwriters themselves. if this game is ever on sale dont hesitate to buy it its the greatest.",1
"played a bit. moded it. played a bit got back on to play more. doesnt work anymore. uninstall mods. doesnt work. reinstall game. doesnt work. loved this on my xbox though. it just doesnt work for me here.",1
"i may be the last guy to buy and play this game. i dont know why i waited so long! if you scrolled passed all the other reviews to read this one, just buy the game already! ou wont regret it!",1
"this game is amazing! the story line is very detailed (just like the textures) and very long. it can be difficult at times, but the side quests, and they have a ton of them, can raise your level, get you new weapons and armors, and help you beat that main story quest line! they have an inventory system where you can only carry a certain amount of items before you cant run because it is too heavy, and the magic system has a menu where you can select a shout and spells! you can favorite both and open the favorites menu in battle and equip a spell, weapon, or an item. you can unlock shouts by collecting dragon souls, which come from dragons once you kill them. dragons will randomly appear. you could also become a vampire or a werewolf! as you can see, there are many things to do in skyrim, so i would rate it a 10 out of 10!",2
"easily one of the best games ever made period. the hype was real and it delivered. first few hours are boring though, but after that you get addicted. period. archery best perk just kill dragons in 5 bow shots lmao",1
"i am at a loss for words of the sheer size and scope of this game (not even mentioning mods) in total a 10,000/10 in my opinion a near perfect game.",3
"ive always loved the elder scrolls, morrowind and skyrim are by far the best.",1
"an absolute privilege to play. bethesda again prove that they can still create the most impressive rpgs. core elder scrolls combat, new level up system, a new, brilliantly realised land to explore.. i could go on, but you shouldve bought this game long before you read this.",1
"explosive chickens and all the game of thrones/tf2 characters and weapons i could ask for, buy it now!",1
"skyrim is a buetiful game with some of the best graphics for bethesda ive ever seen!",1
"best game i played so far besides team fortress 2 i highly recommand any one to get this game 10/10 if you do ever get this game write in consol !coc qasmoke and to get out !coc whiterun !",1
"i never liked this at first, but given enough time i loved it just as much as all of bethesdas wonderful games.",1
"fantastic game, just wish the dlcs were such a rip-off",1
"77k written about this legendary product. how can i say any new for you? its one the greatest game in history you should shame on yourself if you dont try it once.",1
"the greatest adventure youll ever go on in a video game.",2
"defenitly one of the best games i have ever played. had it on xbox first, but the mods made me buy this game again for pc 10/10 would recommend",1
"the fun never ends! skyrim is an epic game with over 80 hours over gameplay time on the standalone version. graphics, sound and free roaming = 10/10",1
"this is probably the 2nd best game i have ever played in my entire lfietime (next to the mass effect trilogy)its enriching story proves to be one of the best to the point where we are still playing this game 3 years after its release, and its freedom of choice allows you to be whatever you want to be. for instaqnce you could be a shield wielding tank mage or dual wielding assassin. this allows the game to be constantly replayed over and over to try out various classes and is an element that i believe all rpgs and mmos today should learn from. 10/10",1
"this game is very fun and immersive. the graphics are outstanding and so is the amount of content. this game is a must buy.",1
"the best game i have played all summer. it is so massive and has so much to do that you can get lost in it",1
"dont let my pitiful steam time fool you. ive got hundreds of hours logged into skyrim, on the ps3. i just bought this for the pc to mess around with mods, and sadly had to uninstall it to make room for games that ran smoother on my non-gaming laptop.",1
"mod the  out of it and it can be anything. if you dont then its alright i guess.",1
"10/10 go on sale pleaseeeee i want teh dlcs u iung wot m8 101 - ign i crave more",1
"a worthy successor to the elder scrolls iv, my all-time favorite game, while some things have been greatly simplified (enchanting/magic) the game as a whole stands as the most immersive rpg i have ever been fortunate enough to play in. the story is fantastic, and all the guilds are well developed, even if they sometimes get a bit predictable. surprise, you are the chosen one to a lot of different groups. and you know whats even better? you can break that immersion at any time and just dink about in a huge entertainment sandbox. use the console, spawn a million dragons, send an army of sellswords at a giant and watch as he flings them 300 feet into the air, put a bucket on someones head and rob them blind, you are only limited by your (twisted) imagination. my only concern is for my poor khajiits soul when she dies. it has been firmly pledged to both hircine and nocturnal, and hermaeus mora is showing some interest. i am also an agent of dibella and mara. poor lass is screwed.",1
"i wish i could experience this game for the first time again.",1
"i made mike tyson as a redguard. then i punched a dragon to death.",1
"trust me guys this game is not only the most time consuming game ever its also probably one of the most diverse games ive ever played with layers and layers of a amazing story to epic boss battles and even some bad  loot you dont want to miss out on this epic adventure. ya the combat could use some work but have you seen the modding community you can find anything to put in your skyrim to make the expereince even better so buy this game grab some chips a bottle of mountain dew sit back and relax.",1
"if you have not played and logged at least 200 hours onto this game, you have just missed the excellent experience in visiting a world with one of the most well-established lores in games. the elder scrolls franchise takes place in tamriel, one of the continents in the planet nirn. in this game, you explore skyrim, one of the districts of the imperial empire at the northern part of tamriel, except skyrim is currently politically unstable, and is at the start of a civil war. you will decide who you want to fight for. buy the game, play it, and immerse yourself into the vast world of the elder scrolls. the game is worth every dollar spent and every hour played.",1
"such a fun game. lots of play time and different paths to choose.",1
"easily one of the greatest games. would put top priority on anyones list.",1
"can literally play for hours and hours. endless fun",1
"the elder scrolls v is essentially the epitome of an rpg- immerive world, massive amounts of content, and story that intricately explains places that arent even that important in the big picture- this attention to detail is what makes this game quite possibly the best game i have ever played. the availibility and ease of installing mods makes it possible for even more immersion, or if you want to, lore-breaking fun. verdict- 10/10 with badass seal of approval.",3
"i wish i could erase this game from my memory... so i could experence it for the first time all over again.",1
"despite having all the system requirements, had it checked by a profeesional so my computer is 100% able to gun this game, it has no problems according to the packaging for running on my pc, despite this it keeps crashing after hte first scene at the execution scene, pile of rubbish dont buy!!!!!!!",2
"have you ever wanted to see if you would like the elder scrolls series? this game is the perfect introduction for you. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is the perfect game and introduction if you never played the series and or are looking for the perfect open world experience. with plenty to explore throughout the land of skyrim, adventures to be had all over, discovering treasure and hundreds of quests to play, this is the rpg to play if you really love open world type of games! it is your story, after all... you are the dragonborn! however, this game isnt for everyone. if you dont like open world type of games and prefer something with a more linear experience, then this isnt the game for you. but if you want an rpg that will last you 300+ hours that will never bore you, with mod support, and want the perfect introduction to the elder scrolls series? then pick up this game. you will be satisfied!",2

"if you are looking for a lifelike and immersive customizable game skyrim is the game for you. this game has an incredible amount of detail in world design, every single building in this game is accesable. there are literally thousands of items in thsi game, everything from weapons, equipment, armour, potions, keys and much more. this game has an immense world full of detail with hundreds of quests to do, the best part is its up to you what you want to do. you can change the course of history within the game in so many ways, you can do any of them whenever you want (there is a little bit you have to do at the beginning however). this game is a true masterpiece, i highly recomend.",1
"i killed a chicken. whole town attacked me. 10/10 would kill again.",1
"i killed a chicken and was murdered by a housewife as a result, all while only wearing a helmet and underwear. 10/10 would buy.",1
"a very open, and engaging world. with added mod support for pc, the adventure never ends. if you can look past the bugs in this game (of which there are many) you are looking at one of the most wonderful worlds.",1
"amazing. immersive. a huge map with enemies galore. many quests to keep you continously occupied for hours on end. truly a well made game.",1
"if you want a game that you can play for hours and hours and hours, and then just stop for a long time, and then come back to and play again for hours and hours and hours, then this is the game for you! the only reason not to buy it, is if you dont want to slay dragons and be awesome!",1
"coming from someone who is a huge fan of all the elder scrolls games and also a huge lore fanatic...i absolutely love it! its been my favorite game since its release, if your debating buying it...just buy it already, you wont regret it.",2
"this is a must get game!!!it has very good graphics and very good gamplay!!!one of the best games ive every got my hands on!!!epic metal theme",1
"i love this game. i played way to many hours on my console and now to restart here.",1
"counting my xbox hours i have well over 200 hours on this game and i still havn t seen everything. like every elder scrolls game, it has a great story, good voice acting, fighting and quests are fun and challenging. dont like something about it? want to make somthing better or just add more hours to the game? look at the steam workshop and/or the nexus for great mods that will do most everyhing you could want (not everything but most) dont know much about nexus but geting mods is very very easy. it looks amazing too, and thats without all the graphical enhancement mods you can get this game rocks and with mods it rocks even more. pay all the money for this one guys! =)",2
"it is very buggy and nearly unplayable without mods. but it is a good game. get it and get mods that makes it work and you are golden. you will not regrett it. get skyui first of all because the standard ui is more of a punch and vomit rather then an actual ui. you might suffer the occasional crash and such. that is rather the norm these days anyway. bethsda might not do much to fix errors in their games but at least they let users try to. not perfect but at least its something.",2

"i suplexed a mean old woman in an orphanage because a little boy put a hit out for her. 10/10",1
"an absolute joy to play! - kool19 the game is full of content that will keep you entertained for hours plus by purchasing the pc version you are purchasing the best version availiable due to community created mods availiable at the skyrim nexus as well as the steam workshop! my only complaint is that bethesda seemed to be more focused sometimes on making a lot of content instead of quality content in a few cases. i recommend all the dlcs even though dawnguard was a bit boring if you buy it during the steam sale your getting it at a steal!",1
"skyrim is one of the most entertaining games ive played in a long time its been able to hold me up on many different consoles with the easy to play game or straight out impossilbe depending on the difficulty. i highly suggest this game to people who like the idea of just wandering a place you dont know and you have to find out what to do.",1
"skyrim is one of those games that is okay without mods. and then you get mods. and then you get more mods. and then you crash to desktop. and then you install boss. and then you install wryebash. and then you install more mods. and then you realise that nothing is the same as vanilla skyrim and everything is way too high texture quality which causes fps loss and everyone has custom armour and special walk animations and jiggly  and you randomly start swimming and everything explodes when you open any door and your sensitivity in 3rd person isnt symmetrical for up and down and left and right and... and youre okay with that because you have a mod that fixes all that. and youre not addicted because you can stop modding anytime. and youre getting really frustrated that nmm doesnt let you have more than 150 things in your load order.",2
"cant seem to get enough of this game! love it! you never play the same way twice...unless you really want to but whats the fun in that?",2
"very addicting and fun. with all the options you can play dozens of times and still find something new to do",1
"i know this game is getting a little long in the tooth these days, but its a masterpiece. with the mods made by the community to upgrade the graphics sound gameplay, add extra missions (mostly all for free) this game could roll on for years without ever feeling dated. if you secretly harbour a passion for role playing games and dont want to harrased by the mmorpg player intent on ruining your day, then look no further! offline yes! better than any online game ... definitely!",1
"i only buyed this game because you take off people clothes in public! one of the best rpg games i have ever played,full recommended from me and its a huge game and many quest and caves to be explored and its freaking awesome!",1
"excellent rpg. enormous game world. too much to see and do! must...return...to...quests... the game world is so detailed and expansive. you can spend hours just wandering around exploring the random landscape and encounters before you even set foot on the main quest. loving the game so far. cant wait for the dlc or expansions. if you liked oblivion or morrowind, you will love skyrim. it takes the best of the previous two games and melds them into a wonderful new gaming experience. two thumbs up.",1
"love this game!! i got it for the xbox 360 on release date and a year later i built my pc and bought it for it again a few months or so back on sale. this game is just as fun the 4th time for the pc! i love getting mods and using the console, graphics are very nice. i think bethesda should drop this whole eso thing and make another single-player rpg. make the graphics like what they did with oblivion on the crytek engine! if they did that and made it span across a world id pay top dollar for that, glitches and all! anyways, i think destruction mage pretty much sucks in this game versus oblivion, combat and archery is great though. i love smithing, never got into alchemy. i adore playing stealth in games and i had fun sneaking around in this game. one thing that disappointed me about skyrim vs oblivion was that the mages college, companions and dark brotherhood were really lame in comparison, though still enjoyable for the 5 minutes it took for each. they definitely could have extended the gameplay in those areas. overall, great game! play it if you havent! get it if youre on the fence about buying it again if you had it on a console at first!",1
"this game is one of my highly favorite games. you take place in a beautiful fantasy land, and you are the dragonborn. you can do so many things, i mean tons. this game has sword fighting , battles , magic , thievs and the best part ; dragons!. nuff said. 11/10 rpg factor : 9/10 graphics: 9/10 story line ( of the dragonborn) 8/10 combat system : 9.5/10 ( best ive played ) pros: a very polished ,well done game. the open world factor is fantastic. insane amount of things to do. i see people with reviews that have like 700 hours on the game. almost never gets boring ( as long as you do missons most of the time) cons: a fair amount of glitches here and there. there is a good amount of oh ill stop playing in a bit or i stop when i finsh this mission, and you continue to play for a good amount of time, while most people and myself like that in a game, it can become slighty addictive. this is a weird one but. the fact that there is so many things to do means you might not ever feel like you can finsh this game. buy factor : if you can get the legendary editon while on sale go for it right a way . or if you feel like this game is enough for you, go for the game for full price, ( which i think is now $19.99) this game has it all so if you think that you might like, there is a good chance you will really like it!",1
"its a great simple fun to play game, be careful. you will get addicted!!",1
"i thought this would suck but it actually wasnt that bad. cools spells and fighting system. i wish the weapons could be easier to swap but i bet theres a mod for that somewhere.",1
"this game is amazing! it was brilliantly put together! the detail in this game is amazing. there is a very strong story line to go with or you can do whatever! i recommened this game for everyone who can afford or play it! 100/100",2
"unreal game - one of the best rpg games ive played. and ive been playing rpg and adventure games since the original colossal cave adventure and the infocom zork era. wow, adventure/rpg games have come so far !!! thanks for the years of enjoyment. all i need to say is xyzzy and im teleported to a better place. lol merry christmas to all",1
"i took a week off from work to play this game when it was released...i should have took two.",2
"obviously skyrim is a phenomenal game, but specifically, the pc version is incredible. the modding community for this game is insane. the mods will do anything from improve routine aspects of the game that bethesda should have in the first place, to introduce new amazing features, or just fun . i saw a mod today that literally changes the dragons to thomas the train. the roars are train whistles. thats the level of modding depth there is to this game. its absurd. if youre going to play skyrim, you should be playing it on pc. if you have a pc capable of playing it, and you purchased a console copy, you made a horrible mistake.",1
"one of my favorite games. it has some of the most amazing mods.",1
"not even close to role-play games of olden times, but with enough mods, skyrim can be whatever you want it to be. thats where its value lies. and you can yell at clouds, like abe simpson. that has to be worth something!",1
"very good game! maybe the best of the series! lots hours of fan but when you level up is getting less challenging.",1
"this is bethesda, and with that, all pc gamers know what that means. its means, a vanilla game thats buggy as  and by itself not worth playing. on the otherhand it also means a game that has a thriving modding community that fixes most if not all the issues people may have with the vanilla product. purchase this with that in mind.",1
"if youre looking for an immersive, fun and customizable experience, you should look no further than here. the modding system on its own makes for endless replayability, and i find myself coming back to experience what new user-created content there is ever so often.",1
"watch out, its quite the adventure! complete with workshop its never ending!",1
"great game. completed it originally on the console, and now got it cheap on a sale through steam for old-times sake. no doubt will enjoy ploughing hours into this again, especially with all the dlc i didnt have before. would echo some other reviews and comments that the engine they used is certainly dated now, and mechanics are a bit clunky, but who really cares if it plays good. i mean, fez is brilliant and that just a bunch of old-school pixels.",1
"the graphics on here when you install the better texture pack as so good, i feel like im looking at 8 bit graphics when i leave the house.",1
"ive played the game so many times ive last count, and im still not bored yet.",1
"skyrim is one of, if not the, best rpgs of our time. if you havent already, dive into the land of skyrim to discover your destiny as the dragonborn. defeat your enemies with magic, or steel. discover beautiful locations, and make new friends. just avoid nazeem, whatever you do.",1
"easily kills hordes of dragons....gets killed by 3 whiterun guards... 10/10 would die again",1
"first time, hated it. gave it a second chance trying to follow the story line and not wander around thinking oh so open world but i cant find anything to do this is pointless. amazing fun and captivating game. i dont follow the story too much, it carries on from previous games, though not needed to know for skyrim. level up, customise, dungeon crawl, quest complete, kill dragons, faff around jumping up mountains and shooting npcs from afar. sometimes i just sit and stealth shoot some elk around whiterun as some mock animal hunting simulator. great variety available well worth any amount of money.",1
"one of the best, deepest, and most solid games out there. definitely a 9.7/10",2
"best rpg out currently. it will likely stay that way until fallout 4 is released.",3
"a good mod-able game. if you still havent played it ^.^",1
"a huge time waster, but in a good way. theres an almost limitless amount of things to do and a huge variety of mods thanks to the community. this game gets a 10/10 from me!",1
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",1
"to ye who gaze upon this review, if this game is on sale (hell, if it isnt, either), buy it now. steam says i only have about 400 hours into this game, but i actually have well over 3000 hours into it. not only is this the most expansive open world game i have ever played, it is also the game that kept me sucked into its world the longest. even if you have done every single thing in the entire game (even after my play time, i havent), there are 3 awesome expansion packs and a massive modding community to get into. if you are looking for a last minute christmas present, this is the one.",2
"this game was absolutely incredible. a fine addition to the elder scrolls series. the entirety of the game is breathtaking and deep to where you get completely wrapped up in the environment, lore, and characters.",1
"its a good game but it does have really bad combat but it has alot of mod support but for me it got quite old fast its a good game but not the best by any means",1
"skyrim is fun and addicting, but the dungeons are too linear, puzzles are a bit easy, and the combat can be a bit dull. id give it an 8/10",1
"this game gives us an amazing and terrific feeling from the world of skyrim! a huge world with many places intresting places to explore... many choises to evolve your character. graphics gameplay and soundtrack are all very impressive and its one of the best games i have ever played!!! mods will add unlimited value to this game... skyrim is really a pc exclusive game...",1
"what are you doing reading reviews?!?!?!?!?! just buy it already!!!!!",2
"this game is amazing beyond belief why did in never play this earlier.",1
"this game has kept my attention for a long time and kept me coming back to it. the gameplay is varied, the quests are interesting and the world is amazing to explore. plus, dragons.",1
"playing it through the 1st run through is great as it takes a while to finish off the campaign. the missions are diverse and intense, yet some show surreal serenity. the one problem which i have come across is repetitiveness, as when you make a new character you will find that you will drop off slowly. - squinty",1
"whats to say that hasnt been said already? this is an amazing, open game that is more beautiful with every new space you find. it runs well on my three year old triple-core amd box and i couldnt be happier.",1
"i originally had this game on my xbox, but my desire for mods made me use a laptop. skyrim is a fun game with lots of content. you maybe wondering wouldnt it get repatative doing the same quests each time you playthough the game?. well, thats where you are wrong friend. with the wonderful mods available on steam and the skyrim nexus, this maybe one of the few games that may never get old. each day new quests, cloths, and other additions are being added everyday to this wonderful game. i would highly recommend. many hours of this combined with my xbox hours have been wasted on this game .",2
"skyrim. its an elder scrolls game, which means youre going to have a huge world to explore again and that really is the main feature of the base game. the combat system, if you want to call it that, is unimpressive and magic feels more limited than it did in previous elder scrolls installments and the main storyline is acceptable but not great by any standards. however what bethesda did do right is the creation of the world all this happens in. dungeons and ruins are more varied compared to what they were like in oblivion and the outside world is huge in its own right and allows for days worth of exploration. so despite its flaws id strongly recommend this game. there is however a lot of snow. you probably should be looking at an other title if you have a phobia for snow.",3
"dis gam is es cool bcuz i get to fus ro dah peple and tak of ter cloths.",1
"what can i say about this game? its a elder scrolls game! a elder scrolls game does not dissapoint! skyrim is the coolest thing since sliced bread with the killing dragons and fighting wars and- hold on a moment, ... its just so beautiful... skyrim is a very pretty game and you can add hours with dlc and mods. get this game!",1
"if u have soul by this game. if u dont, buy watch_dogs",1
"this game is amazing it ias so large so open hours of fun can be had with just the game itself however the expantion packs just add more.",1
"this games pretty sweet. but you probably knew that already.",1
"stabbed a dragon , ate 10 apples, stabbed the dragon again, ate 10 more apples. on the 3rd blow the dragon asked me to share the apples. were friends now. 10/10",1
"what else is there to say about this game. its skyrim. love it.",1
"exceptional game, a++ highly recommend to any person even remotely interested in open world games.",1
"are you ready for the slowest frame rate of your gaming career? well then download and waste 30 hours in bethesdas not fallout 4 game, skyrim. in skymall, you play as the swag god, dovahkiin or dragonborn, who minds you into a different dimmension with his spooky spaghetti squash that he inherited from some dude who nailed a dragon. your main enemy is some shrek looking dragon called alduiin who saves you from getting killed so i dont see why youd kill him but hey bethesdas bethesda. you know whats funny? bethesda doesnt even have their headquarters in bethesda in maryland. anyways, another main enemy is the imperial army, or the inbreds called the stormcoats. after you chop off alduiins uncircumsized , you use it in battle against whatever army you choose, but at the end of the day it doesnt even matter because every ing character looks the same and dont move their faces at all.  you",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim, presumably the most anticpated game of 2011. the game brings together various aspects of real life such as buying a house, getting married, adopting children (dlc) and of course, shouting people off of mountains with youre intense voice. but then, it brings in a fictional and mythical nordic era in which we are able to explore vast dwemer ruins, ancient nordic crypts and the wildland of skyrm to hunt down treacherous foes. the combat system.. it allows you to be a sneaky elf raining down arrows with his bow, a towering nord wielding a two handed axe of complete destruction or a peaceful, but dangerous wizard wielding a humble staff. overall a 10/10 game.",2
"it could have been better honestly, the guild quests were just bad. looked better than oblivion though and as usual was still an amazing time wasting game that i had fun in.",2
"600+ hours in so far, would have been a great deal at $100. the modding community keeps churning out incredible free mods that are almost as in depth and expansive as official dlcs. new quests, new story lines, new spells, armor and weapons coming out constantly and free. great game.",3
"one of the greatest gaming experiences ive ever had. skyrim will easily consume hours or even days your time, and youll enjoy every second. even the glitches have a sort of endearing quality to them.",1
"fun game with grate addons and funny random moments, grate grafixs and good stroyline on xbox beat the main story line",1
"o.....m......g this game is soooooooo amazing i reccomend this game to everyone!!! buy it buy it now!!!",1
"great game, its been some time since i played a good rpg game as such. very similar to swkotor 2 mechanics-wise. great setting, infinite quests, fun gameplay and endless replayability.",1
"another elder scrolls... what more can i say? if youve ever played them before, then you know how the series works. skyrim just takes its predecesors and multiplies it tenfold. skyrim is literally yours to roam and conquer. this open world sandbox rpg is a definite must for any pc gamer. plus the endless amounts of mods make the gameplay, immersion, and content so much better. its just really really good.",1
"this game is awesome!! amazing story and extremely detailed =d",1
"why are you even reading reviews? just buy the game if you like action rpg open world games where you have so much to do over 500 hours of gameplay, (can have way more hours of gameplay with mods)",1
"this game is fantastic, theres tons of moral choices you have to make and the story puts citizen kane to shame. plus theres tons of stupid s you can j/o to, if you buy this game at any less than $60 you are straight up stealing.",1
"this game is my second favorite game of all time.it has a lot of replay value,allthough its hard to finish the last few levels. unmoded its a good game but moded its awsome,so i recomend moding it.",2
"good graphics, great gameplay, awesome storyline. what more can i say?",1
"im just typing this recommendation for the community badge. awww yeah.",1
"this is a very fun and time consuming game. if you like large maped rpgs with dragons and fun quests this might be for you.",1
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",1
"very good game! imo it has been improved in every aspect over oblivion.",1
"this game took several hours of my life and i loved every minute of it.",2
"amazing! probably one of the best fantasy realms ever created. there is so much to do and its tons of fun! be prepared though because youll either play this game for a very long time or force yourself to stop. i also recommend the dlcs if you can. now sadly the storyline is not that great but there is so much extra content involved that it doesnt matter at all. skyrim is definitely an amazing game!",1
"this game is really fun. i have no regrets for purchasing this game. there are so many quests this game will practically never end. it is also real fun, and some of the killcams are epic. if you are deciding if you want it or not you should totally purchase it. worth the $90.",2
"must have rpg!!! awesome gameplay, graphics and totally captivating!",1
"this game is amazing for people who like rpgs and and with the wide variety of mods avalible on the steam workshop and the skyrim nexus the game will never get old.",1
"totally worth buying but if your thinking about buying the dlc eventualy it would be smarter to just buy the legendary edition but other than that awesome game and totaly recomend it",1
"the epicness of this game is just unreal! and the mod workshop? intense! if only there was a workshop for oblivion and morrowind :)",2
"pretty sure fus-ro-dah is telling dragons to suck it but definitely worth yelling for 100 hours",1
"the most fun. i waste my whole life playing this game",1
"i used to be a meme like me, until i took a skyrim to the knee. all (horribe) jokes (memes) aside (patella related arrow shaft incident), this game (in its vanilla state), is solid. with mods, (god[s] forbid[s]), this game can well... make it whatever you download it to be. depending on the mods you get yada yada yada, sweet rolls something about being a dragonborn and grey beards. 420/doritos, would mountain dew again.",1
"this game is so fun with mods! and even with no mods it is a fun game to adventure around in. i recommend the game!",1
"32 hours in, yet to kill my first dragon, and i think im just about ready to start the game proper. content rich much?",1
"while my pc play time might not show it, i love this game. i must have played 100 hours on the xbox version, so im probably skyrimd out right now.",1
"awesome game, but how do you exit the charecter creation?",2
"skyrim is for sure one of the best games i have ever played everything about it is awesome and for what ever it lacks there is always a mod for that... just trust me i know",3
"this is definately in my top ten probably my top five of best games ive played all time. it is defeinately the best rpg i habe ever played. you can create just about any character type you can think of and then take that build to the extremes. the graphics are excellent and the gameplay is smooth and fast moving. it provides you with a first or third person viewpoint but does not force you down a linear path. there are a large number of story missions with atleast ten times that in side missions. outside of the missions you have the ability to own homes and make families. even with 150h in i still am just barely scratching the surface of what this game has to offer.",1
"i love it you can punch things and shout at you enemies",1
"this has to be my favourite game of all time! id never played rpgs before this, so i didnt really know what to expect. all i knew is it was big, and that attracted me to it. i played this through to 100% on vanilla settings and i thought the graphics and scenery were awesome. then i discovered the modding community. the amount of available mods is mind blowing, to the point you can create a world so beautiful youll never want to leave. 630+ hours on multiple play throughs and modding and i dont regret a minute of it. buy this game. 11/10",3
"fun! its a game where you run around stealing things and then running away on a stolen horse. epic game!!!!",1
"if you havent played skyrim at this point, do it! this game is fantastic, i logged 80+ hours on ps3 back at the release and picked up the legendary edition on sale to play through the dlc and revisit a great game. i promise it will fill soooo many hours with adventure, youre going to love it.",1
"if the fact that ive played over 300 hours of this game doesnt convince you, i dunno what will.",2
"loaded up 100 mods, duplicated 3000 cheese wheels at the peak of the throat of the world. ctd. 10/10",1
"quite frankly one of the best games ive ever played. beautifully designed, engaging, and with a world of opportunities this game can be played multiple times from different angles and never become dull. recommend it for anyone.",2
"skyrim is an amazing rpg and i always find myself playing it.. the communities mods are really good and make the game much better than having it on an xbox or ps3.",1
"great game, especially if owned through steam and the available workshop. still after 2 years, development is strong and the games new downloadable content make it even better.",1
"ever wanted to experience the sprawling, living world of an mmo without having to deal with all those pesky other players? then this is the game for you! its all the best things about the truly expansive environments of those games, but a single player story that keeps the player at the center. its a couple years old now, but the fact that new content is still coming out from the player-base should give you some idea about how well the games holding up. everyone is going to have a very different experience of the world of skyrim. no ones dragonborn is going to quite be the same as someone elses. personally, i cant wait to see what the elder scrolls mmo shapes up to be. in the meantime, though, ill be content to live out an adventurers life as the bucket stealing viking of my dreams.",1
"my favourite game of all time. nothing will out-do it!",1
"this is still an awesome game. with modding the skies the limit, just make sure to mod the guards dialogue, the arrow in the knee thing is a little bit too old now.",1
"if you like hardcore and intense battles this is totally the game for you!!!!",2
"is okay i guess u have to get the dragan soles a,d opne guy is goof dragoan",1
"this game was brilliant when i played it on the xbox360, but on pc with added mods has given the game a whole new dimension.the mod frostfall adds more realism to the game and has made it feel like a new game.",2
"this game is an easier to understand version of past elder scrolls games, fairly large sandbox but smaller compared to tes4 however, this game contains more content per square foot, with an absurd amount of quests. good game. it is easy for people new to elder scrolls and sandbox rpgs to get into. as a stand alone game, it is very good, could be the best fantasy sandbox rpg to come out for 5-7 years. the dlc refines this game, though it is not entirely needed for a great experience. the modding community is massive for this game, and credit to them for letting players choose what they want in their gameplay experience. at this point the sky is the limit when it comes to modding, allowing players to fix most of the problems with the game. need bugfixes, mods do that need new weapon designs and choices, mods do that. want the game to look better, mods do that. want to balence out the game more, mods do that. it is a different style of game than tesiii/tesiv but still a very good game. buy it, still better than the $60 games people are releasing three years later.",5
"i was going to make a 1 work stupid review, but many people beat me to it so...... skyrim is the kind of game to which you will dwelve countless of hours, you think to yourself man, i will do this quest and go to sleep but then bam some idiot lost something, and you need to de-enchant some stuff. when i play this game, i know im at least going to play 5-7 hours straight. if you think skyrim had too many bugs, or that it didnt had enough npcs to make it feel alive, or perhaps you didnt liked the whole leveling system as a whole, theres mods. mods < m. o. d. s the one thing that will make those 5-7 hours pass like 5-7 minutes. unofficial patches, overhauls, immersion, non play-doh textures, you name it, they have it. overall and excellent game and i would give skyrim a 9/10. it lacked a few things, but im sure the next title in the series will fix that.",1
"this is by far my favorite game i have ever played. the open world of skyrim is full of countless captivating adventures and you create the world you want to live in. the whole game is completly in your control and costumizable!",1
"by far my favorite game in years. you can do no wrong by getting this! worth every penny. endless custimization and the best single player game out there! get it!!!",2
"dis be gud gaem. buy dis. but no, fo reels, this is an awesome game, plenty of hours to be spent here with lots of sidequests, tasks, whatever.. and, theres a workshop for it. so buy it.",1
"ive been playing the elder scrolls for years now and skyrim is by far the best.",1
"amazing game. if you play it without mods, it is wonderful, a great expansion to the lore. mods, however, is like adding carmel to ice cream. it only makes it better. best mods are enbs and other graphic mods, to make this game bueatiful.",1
"if you like questing in a fantasy world and dont own this game you might be insane. say whatever you like about simplified mechanics and action combat, skyrim takes you to a world like few games do and is fun from begining to end.",1
"skyrim is pretty amazing, but if you have a slow computer the experience is ruined. its a great game though, especially if youre into fantasy stuff.",1
"hey friends i rite this review from india. india libary, i ask women to install steam on computer. she do install it and i make account and buy skyrim. it is good game for many reason. first i say i buy game by selling goat, if u want to send me moeny to buyt back goat so i can drink milk slumdoggillionare@ind.ia. i like to play this game, every day i play game at libary. i do not get in trouble because libary women is nice. good game i say. hourse i play this game, i like to do story. play as khajit and steal from people like my brother at home. i show brother he laugh say no realism. i say  you  face. i become theft guild master and kill people. was good game when youi kill big dragon. kill dragon is funnest part. also kill nasty black man who tell me abbout clouds. i reccomended 10/10",1
"i use to be an adventuer like you but then i took an arrow to the knee. killed every guard who said this 10/10 would do again.",1
"i have played skyrim on every system the ps3, xbox 360, and now the pc and i have to say that the consoles dont even come close to the preformance of the pc and i dont even have the best computer. so to all those wondering if you should buy skyrim on the pc or on the consoles id would tell you if your computer meets the minimum requirements defiantly buy it for the pc, if your computer doesnt and you cant upgrade your computer then get it on the xbox 360 because the ps3 is the worst of all!!!",1
"wtf?! i stoped playing this game for a year and when i try to play it again it says unavailable for your region???.....",2
"love the graphics, the voice acting, the side quests, the combat mechanics, the dungeons, the caves, the creatures and animals and mammoths and giants, the songs sung by npcs, the crafting, the chicken hunting, the fusrodah-ing, and everything else about this game. then i hit 75 hours of playtime, and decided ive had enough and got bored of it all. such a pity i never went far in the main quest storyline. would definitely come back to finish the main quest, one day.",1
"there are nearly endless opportunities in skyrim. i played it on the console before buying the legendary edition for pc, so i knew what i was getting. the ability to mod the game makes for even more customizations and adventures. amazing story? check. amazing graphics (with texture dlc)? check. customizable? check. not needing to be connected and play with idiot teenagers? check. tl;dr: worth it. buy it.",1
"very g00d game. you can kill wolfs and stuff. better graphics than in real life.",1
"when it comes to medieval genres, think skyrim! skyrim can really immerse you into a medieval fantasy of fighting and magic, its crazy! you can explore the vast land of skyrim and fight dragons, giants, bandits, draugrs (ancient warrior zombies ;) ), etc! really cool game, so go get it!",1
"first off, its a great game, it would be stupid to deny it, but if youve had some issues with morrowind and oblivion (and even fallout 3), they havent been fixed. the animations are still awkward, the combat ai is stiil fight or flee, without any variation or tactics needed. i dont care about the main story as its a sandbox, but the dialog is abysmal. the balance later in the game crawls into a hole and dies, making the game quite dull the farther you get. and as with any bethesda title, there are bugs everywhere. but its still fun to play and when the community starts churning out mods, its gonna be amazing. as someone who hated oblivion before it was cool to hate it, i say i had fun with skyrim. get it when its on sale.",1
"married the puppygirl who claws faces off... 10/10",1
"a must have! so many possibilities and endless quests! i rly love the game even tho its the buggiest ive ever played! looking foward to elder scrolls online!",1
"excellent game, right up there with morrowind and oblivion. only faltering in some aspects, such as underpowered magic and a lackluster main questline. it built on the foundation that oblivion and morrowind had and improved on the combat and mechanical aspects of those games, while maintaining the great immersion and storytelling youd except from an elder scrolls game. overall, 9.5/10. if you plan on playing a mage character however, youll need a few addons to bring magic up to par with melee and ranged combat.",1
"this is probably my favorite elder scrolls game. the map is massive and there is a never ending amount of side quests to complete.",1
"my most favourite rpg game that i own, or even my favourite game. 10/10",1
"even though it is a few years old it is still a great game!",1
"this game is an amazing work of art! i currently have 15 hours and counting, and 1/3 of those hours were spent exploring the world. it has a vast open feel to it, and is quite rewarding the more you play it. this is probably one of the best open world, fantasy, rpgs i have ever played, and nothing comes close in terms of character building. i currently have 15 hours on one character, and i plan to start another. also, one of the main reasons this has so much replayability is mods! with steam workshop you can be playing skyrim: zelda edition in minutes. this games is a 10/10 must buy!",1
"dis gaem iz 2good4u m8. u can becomez a l33t destructionz mastur, and raep all the dragunzz!!",1
"all around a very good game. though it lacks the depth previously seen in games like oblivion and morrowind, skyrim is a much more accessable game and a good way to start the series.",1
"i made the terrible mistake to buy this game. now i usually dont play much else. really awesome game and definitely in my top 3 of best games ever.",1
"very good game. while the story may not be as good as in previous elder scrolls games, its still a epic game. the fact that you play as a dragonborn is a nice change, which brings me to the shouts. they were a very good addition to the game, and they can be pretty fun, for example unrelenting force (a.k.a. the popular fus ro dah). graphics wise, its not the best there is in terms of textures (theres also shadow striping in some spots), but graphics arent always the main priority of a game. there are bugs, and stuff that should have been in the game, but the dlcs add extra questlines and content which are really great (my favorite is dragonborn, but you may have different opinions). dragonborn and dawnguard add extra questlines and places, and hearthfire gives you the ability to build your own home in 3 places. even so, if you want the game to be perfect, then get the mods you want and your experience will be very great. score: 9/10 (by itself) 9.4/10 (with dlc) 10/10 (with dlc and mods)",1
"very good game but can be very laggy. it also has the dlc packs that are great and are at a good price.",1
"epic gameplay with a so-so story some bugs and glitches but with countless mods on the nexus and the steam workshop there is almost endless replay value.",4
"buy this, just do it. its fun, it seemingly never ends (im like 30 some hours into it and nowhere near running out of quests), and for 20 bucks its an epic deal.",1
"excellent, cant wait for elder scrolls online 10/10",1
"even long after the announcement that bethesda is closing out im still playing the basic version and finding little things i missed/forgot/sped by. its not one of the biggest open worlds, but this is plenty of cave crawling (about half) you still have a lot of exploring to do.",2
"by far one of the best games on steam or any console.a must have for all serious gamers",1
"welcome to skyrim! oh look a giant! oh look a bear! oh look a sabrecat! okay... that was too much. lets just go play some hearthfire. oh look. youve got no money. back to adventure. behold the skyrim cycle",1
"i think skyrim is a very good open world rpg great character customization and amazing world. physics could better, but in there difference it does make for some good laughs. just and overall good rpg game it portrays the fantasy world very well with having the ability to create any class you could choose ; things such as a heavy mage, or a robed warrior these are all classes that you get to make yourself no set classes like other rpg. its a fun time killer and there are a ton of side missions to keep this game going for very long. you will build up hours of fun with this game.",1
"cant talk, slaying dragon. ..... ok, in all seriousness, this is one of the biggest rpgs ive ever had the pleasure of playing, and there is so much to do before delving into the active modding community that it is well worth the cost.",2
"this is a fantastic i would recommand this game to every one who likes free to rome games.",1
"this game is fun i do not like the fact the main person is about to be de headed but it is a fun rpg has great mods and all kinds of fun stuff that i do not want to ruin for people who want to try it.",2
"best game ive ever played. almost endless modding oppurtunity and hours of entertainment.",1
"ive played the previous tes: oblivion goty on my ps3 and i cant seem to find the incentive to finish the game. the game became repetitive and eventually started to feel like a chore. this game seemed to address both, i love the immersion this game gives, especially with the introduction of shouts, dragons, better graphics, etc.. even if there are still some areas that can be improved from ui to combat, it seems that there are various mods available out there to addresss hem. i look forward to start utilizing mods to further enhance the immersion. i own both xbox 360 and pc version of this game and ive only played the console version a couple of times and never bothered to go back after playing the pc version with max settings.",1
"i love all the es games. i started in morrowind. skyrim is great if you lear how to mod it, especially using nexus",1
"pretty addicting if your the one for rpgs. its also a very beautiful game too and nice ambient music when going around a village or in the wilderness (yeah im a real sucker for ambient music).",1
"look for the lower case l and you will be kissed tomorrow: lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll lllll *now look for the q and your wish will come true: ... ... ... ... ... oooooooooooooooooooqooooooooooooooooooooooooo o.. .oooooooo *this is really hard, now find the n: mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmnmm *now find the mistake: abcdefghijklnmopqrstuvwqyz *something you really want, after the countdown!!!!! 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 now close your eyes and make a wish! ;*;*;*;*;*;* now paste this on 9 pages and your wish will come true! hurry, you have 20 minutes! or what you wished for will be the opposit",1
"very good rpg reccomend anyone to buy it . its completely worth it",1
"this is possibly one of the best games ive ever played!",1
"expansive, beautiful, open-ended, tons of stuff for treasure hoarders, tons of stuff you can make through smithing and enchanting, a creation kit for those who love to build dungeons and program quests... how can you play this game and still have a social life? just ask yourself that one buddy.",1
"i cant believe i put off getting and playing this game for so long. its a very rich open-world experience, and i feel like im just now getting into the game after 70+ hours. while you can concentrate on doing storyline stuff, you could just as easily spend many hours exploring the nooks and crannies of skyrim, building your house(s), or reading the many in-game books loaded with backstory. it would be very easy to spend hundreds of hours immersed in this gem of a title. all that said, you absolutely need to make use of a few mods to get the most out of the game experience. skyrim script extender (skse) is a vital underpinning, and skyui helps shed the console-centric feel of the default menus. from there, youve got almost limitless options for customization via mods. theres even a project working to port morrowind into the skyrim game engine.",1
"most in depth game ive ever experienced. so many things to do, so many journies to take.",1
"ive played the xbox 360 version and i have to say that im more than pleased with this one, for the love of god give me more lol",1
"a great game. not without its bugs and glitches, but a excellent addition to the elder scrolls series. with the addition of the steam workshop and the amazing mod creators the replayability shoots through the roof. 9/10",1
"best open world game ever. if you are into modding games and love to waste a bunch of time look no further. easily put 300 hours into this game and it is still fun. great lasting appeal. note that you may want to be experience with at least general mods because there are a lot of mods that are necessary to fix bugs.",1
"a must have for pc i completely love the elder scrolls series and i played the heck out of this on 360 but i recently bought it for pc and now i can mod it which makes it more fun and longer with all new quests and story lines. i highly recommend this to anyone who loves rpg games",1
"this game is just phenomenal, have great story and surrounding and so many things you can do either in questing or in the world of skyrim. this game is must buy for every single rpg fan.",1
"my addiction. its like heroin. skyrim is love. skyrim is life.",1
"the best game ever and has some of the best mods!!!",1
"lots to do, best looking fantasy world ever created, oh and 10/10 if there werent so many glitches",1
"dragons, swords and sorcery. has consumed more lives than alduin ever will with its quests and beautiful landscapes. the dlc is also excellent and adds even more life consuming quests and more places to explore and pillage. 10/10 would buy again",2
"the elder scrolls series is most likely the best rpg series i have ever played and skyrim as the newest edition makes it just that much better",1
"omfg this game is my fav game all time nuthing i bet can bet it",2
"wait hold on 4th review lets put this in to cattory gameplay-unspeakply awesome iwill be trying to get to one place then on the way there i see some bandits cave i go in there get some money to go do something else. graphics- watch the trailer. intro by starmade gamers baconhoggaz",1
"this game is absolutely briliant. even in the year 2014 i have still yet to complete the main story because of all of the extra content. if you love rpgs, this game is exactly what youre looking for.",1
"my house vanished and then a flying train tried to kill me. 10/10",1
"great. really,  great. just wish melee combat wasnt so boring. but, after playing this game for a ridiculous amount of time, ive come to realize it is essentailly a game about balancing the three resource bars.",1
"one of the best rpgs of this generation, building off the success of morrowind and oblivion, this game does the elder scrolls series justice and its a good intro to the series. the character customization is great, letting you play one of many races or classes. do you want to play as a fireball-casting lizard? a boxing cat wearing chainmail armor? an orc with poison tipped daggers sneaking in the shadows? go for it. the choice is yours to make. with a huge storyline and many side quests, this game is sure to make that $30 (or what have you) completly worth it. just stop reading this already and buy it.",1
"if you were a fan of morowind and were outraged by the simplifications in oblivion than this game is not for you, if you loved oblivion but could only get 5 minuites into morowind witout having a fit then this is your perfect game. every annoying level related problem from oblivion has been fixed making leveling no longer a curse but a happy momment in your adventures. and if you havnt played any of the past elder scrolls, then you can either jump straight into the world of skyrim, start playing oblivion at least, or just go back to your miserable existence and those wierd jrpgs.",1
"skyrim is such a fun game with many hours of gameplay with many paths to choose as the dragonborn of tamriel.",1
"a very great rpg if you like roaming a vast world and levelling up various talent trees, crafting items and slaying dragons. theres a lot to see and do. seriously a lot of fun. truly a game that grows on you the more you play.",1
"one of the best games ever. also one of the longest. i have 200 hours on it and im still finding things to do.",1
"if youve played the earlier elder scrolls series morrowind and oblivion then skyrim you will love the game is set in the next land called skyrim you are captured and sent to the block for crimes sort of unknown to the player, but things take a turn for the worse when a dragon destorys the village and you use this to escape from being killed. it is here you are giving the chance to explore the beautiful world of skyrim and meet all different kinds of folk and become the hero to save the world of skyrim. the combat is fairly the same with an improved leveling up system the world looks amazing but the added bonus is the steam workshop where people around the world have created mods to enhance the game or add things to make the world of skyrim even better. there are litery 100s of mods to choose from from the workshop as well as the 3rd party app nexus mod manger which have also has 100s of mods to make your experience better. the game is great edition to the series and you can be spending around 100 hrs+ because there is that so much to do.",1
"definitely a good game, would reccomend it to all my friends.",2
"i even got my sister to play it. but, then she wouldnt give me my computer back. thats usually how i pitch it. and even as awesome as the game is on its own merits, i follow it up with ... it gets better. thanks to the amazing modding community, ive added nearly a gb of extra content and polish. however, (disclaimer) just because you can doesnt always mean you should. installing mods can potentially make the game unplayable, or a more pristine product than bethesda produced. either way, its hard heap anything but praise for the game itself.",1
"this game is so good, i cant even write down all the things that are to be said about it. ive played 300+ hours of this game and i still cant wait to play more. skyrim is an amazing open world rpg. the quests are fun, going around and being a sneaky assasin is the best!",2
"awesome game ! gets abit boring though ! :( recommended recommended recommended recommended",1
"skyrim had one of the most disappointing combat systems in a modern game. it had a less interactive combat system than oblivion even. go and play some m&b or something, then come back to skyrim. notice how you are literally left and right clicking, maybe circling an enemy if youre on master/legendary. the combat has no interactivity it is a  console port of a  console game that ruined my enjoyment of tso. 6/10",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim- flying simulator included",1
"never really got into morrowind or oblivion, but dammit, skyrim has me more than hooked. even if i stop playing it for months, i can come back to the same game save and binge for 20 hours and still have so much game content left to play. 67 hours of game time so far and i havent even seen what is west of the initial city or attempted the main story quests.",1
"i launched this for 2nd time thinking of completing 2 more missions, and then i played it 13 hours without any break. 10/10",1
"skyrim is an amazing game released by bethesda 3 years ago. it is the 5th game in the elder scrolls series. i have only played skyrim (tes 5) and oblivion (tes 4). skyrim is a game with a lot a re-playability, so unless you have no patience, then youll enjoy it. allthough it can get very repetative sometimes. one of my friends describes it as going into dungeons and killing draugr. the main focus is around the dragons, which have returned after the oblivion crisis. i highly recommend this as it is now quite cheap and so are the dlc which let you ride dragons, become a vampire lord and build houses among many other things. cant wait for the next elder scrolls game. (not online, thats daylight robbery)",5
"i owe the destruction of both my social life and gpa to this game. but it was totally worth it!",3
"in one word.. bethesda. in more words.. a game that takes no less then infinity to truely say you had enough of it. buy it and all its dlcs.",2
"skyrim is an epic game :d, if you love medieval games with lots and lots of fighting and action :a you found the right game. love you bethedsa",1
"i aleady owned the game on my xbox, but i wanted to try out the modding. the game was enhanced by over 9000%",1
"the elder scrolls series has forever been a part of me, morrowind, oblivion and now skyrim -.. words cannot describe the experiences and the accumulation of hours that i have put into the games. skyrim nor displeases or fails to live up to the expectations. the gameplay and missions are extensive and unique and the rpg revolving around dragons is literally amazing. the shouts and skills operating around each character makes the game even more addicting. i totally recommend this for anyone, especially skyrim, alongside the older games and especially the newer one; the mmorpg.",1
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",1
"very fun game and once you beat the game, you can download other mods to emhance and change your playstyle!",1
"great game , lets me forget time , got me addicted.",2
"fantastic game, huge world ... the only problem is the complexity of the crafting which i will eventually figure out.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim its a fun game it can be very cool and if you get the right mods you can get an addiction to it but overall its a really cool game and i think you should buy it.",1
"this game makes meth look like a baby. it makes heroine seems like childs play. i turned it on and next thing i know i have nearly 200 hours of playtime. worth it.",1
"great game, worth the money. the modding community is great and gives you a great variety of ways to enhance the game.",1
"hands down the greatest game ive ever played i saw my horse flying on top of a mountain, it fell down and when i went looking for it i found him perfectly healthy. 15/10",1
"very fun, beat it and completed all acheivements/throphys on ps3 and xbox 360 now its time to do so on pc",1
"a lot of fun with out mods and more fun with mods.",1
"awesome open-world rpg. huge world with numerous points of interest to visit. good amount of customization with the ability to play how you want (melee, ranged, spell caster, etc.) enjoyable main story line, with a satisfying end, unlike most games. there are lots of gripes and nitpicks about the pc version. many things could be better and more fleshed out, but the game is enjoyable to casual and hardcore players alike. i find this game a bit clunky at times, but is overall much more enjoyable all-around than i found oblivion to be. lots more to say, but youll just have to play it for yourself to judge. i give it a 9/10 because its definitely not perfect, and theres a lot more to be desired, but its not an unplayable game by any means, and definitely has a hundred hours worth of content, if thats what youre into.",1
"youre about to get your head chopped off when a dragon swoops in and destroys the place you were gonna die in, then you find out that your objective in life is to kill these dragons that magically appeared out of the ground because some other dragon that magically came out of the ground started resurrecting the other ones. mod the game, do whatever you like, its basically a sandbox game but with mountains blocking the way.",1
"this game is awesome and very addictive, i played this game for over 200 hr and i still enjoy it. its worth buying. if you are a fan of rpg than this game is a must have. im not suprised that skyrim is voted to the best game of 2011.",1
"get ready for high fantasy! quest for the lusty argonian!",1
"favorite game ever. if you dont want it to end it will oblige giving even the strongest dovakin more and more challenges to overcome.",2
"10/10 i dont know what else i should say about this game. i played it on ps3 it had its cons on that console but i didnt cared, its awesome give it a try! who wouldnt like to shout at people and watch them fly away??? fus ro dah!",1
"skyrim, the 5th instalment on the elder scrolls series. after completing it on console, and moving to pc, the game well out strips that of its console counter part in graphics, comunity and something that consoles dont have, mods.",1
"what can i really say that you dont already know? if you dont/ havent owned this game yet, you should probably go jump off a cliff... in-game, once you buy this... because of my review.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best free-roaming rpg games i have ever played, the game has a solid story-line even if you dont play by the storyline there are likely over 300 side quests that can be obtained from just talking to bartenders or a civilian the game never gets boring, you can play anyway you want as well want to be an elven warrior? or a orcish mage? you can be practically any race or class because you arent restricted, dont like to be the good guy? you can be a thief, murderer, assassin, or you can be righteous and honorable, the game also has many easter eggs. to simplify it this is gta but with much more options a new storyline and based in the mythical world of tamriel. the only problem i have with this game is the fact it is not co-op and has a few bugs here and there. overall rating: 9/10",1
"very fun game, where the game falls short, it more than makes up in the great modding community",2
"not as good as oblivion but easily one of the greatest games ever made.",1
"bethasda, as always, releases another amazing game. a must have game, need not say more",1
"great game, even better when modded out from workshop or nexusmods.",2
"ive put in over 100 hours in this game and still love it. the best open world game i have ever played.",1
"i pushed a horse down a cliff and it teleport back behind me and died. 11/10 horses",1
"its almost ludicrous to write this. if you are reading this right now, wondering, hmm, should i buy this game? than you really need to get out of that rock youre under. this is the game of the year. this game provides countless hours of gameplay, along the path you want to take. its enthralling, every part of it, from the main quest, to the side quests to the enviroment, which feels as if it were living and breathing. if youre still reading this, just buy the game. you wont regret it.",1
"the best rpg game ever. +you can experiment with workshop.",1
"very large game world and lots of things to do. i didnt like the open-world genre before i played this game. the rpg is great and a lot of customization. one thing that could have made the game better is more auto save. it sucked when i was far didnt save then died.",1
"having blast with this game, now i know what i was missing for 2 years.",1
"one of the best single player games of all time. 10/10 must have. nuff said.",1
"this game is best on pc with mods makes endless fun",1
"got it on summer sale 2014 with all the dlcs, 91 hours played and still not bored and not done! money well spent, great game!",1
"the point at which i screamed at my computer  off dragon i am trying to pick flowers, was the point at which i realised this was the best game ever.",1
"who on earth wouldnt recommend this game? 5 stars mate 15/10 150% every good thing",2
"i have spent an obscene amount of time just wandering around stealing whatever looks shiny and sniping anyone who has a problem with it. this game is a great way to just do whatever you want but not in that boring sandbox way.",1
"this game is the climax of role playing and adventure. with mods it is the greatest game ever made. no joke.",1
"really good game. lots of stuff to do. hundreds of hours of content. you could proably spend hours playing this game without even touching the main story. a definite buy for any fan of rpgs. also looks great with graphics mods.",1
"this game is definitely one of the best games i have ever played. ive spent hundreds of hours on it across many systems, pc being the best, and would recomend it to nearly anyone.",1
"this game is amazing, i got this game for 4 bucks, but i would pay 60 if had to. its hard to wrap your mind around when you consider this game has mod support. for those who dont understand what this game is, it is an open world rpg and its massive. 10/10",1
"got this game recently and since killing people in self defense is ok i thought its be fine to kill a chicken. i was in riverwood. i was wrong, the dude started yellling insults at me and killed me immediately. it was hilarious. 10/10 would kill a chicken in riverwood again.",1
"what can i say, morrowind came to me first, then oblivion, and now this. once again, countless hours spent doing everything from slaying dragons and finding the relics of old, to building my own house and adopting a kid. once again, a great deal of life will be eaten away by the elder scroll series. classic.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a great open-world,adventure, rpg style game that lets you decide what to do and when. the best features (personally) are the races and there special abilties. another point is your capability to choose between 2 groups at war, or just join an independent group to get more quests. my only minus point is for people that have a strong (negative) reaction to spiders could or will have some unwelcome jumpscares. i would recommend this game to all rpg loving gamers.",1
"fabulous game thats flexible as a flacid  due to the ability to mod easily via steam workshop and skyrim nexus.",1
"hate this game all you do is walk about and next thing you know theres a dragon gettin up in your grill and its kills you, then every time you restart it keeps killing you so the next thing you see is your desktop after quiting that crap.",1
"you know you played this game long enough you start whistling the dovakin theme song when you pee",1
"so i had over 1000 ingame hours on skyrim xbox 360 edition, so when my account got frozen and i lost everything, it was great comfort i could get it on pc and remake my save from the ground up... plus mods...",1
"i love this game. bethesda did a nice job with hardly any bad bugs. one of my faverite things to do is launch lydia off high hrothgar and find her still alive. this fps rpg is great for adventureing,fighting and getting sent flying by giants. i much perfer to play this game on pc because the loading is much shorter than on ps3 or xbox 360.",1
"this game is large and expansive with no end to its modding capabilities, a game i cant get away from.",1
"sidequests are boring main story line is pretty fun get dat feel of adventure overall this game is worth it, but isnt anything amazing. 6/10",1
"great game! fun game! if i had to make one complaint its that everyone is horrible to you. seriously, the people in fallout, a post-apocalyptic world, were nicer to you. everyone will brag about how much better they are than you, how much of a peasant you are, and make fun of your race. although the children make you want to stick a sword in their throats (yet you cant) the game is very immersive and fun as you can play however you want.",2
"by far one of the greatest games ive played in all my years of gaming. i got this the first day it came out and i havent stopped playing since.",2
"wonderful addition to the elder scrolls line. fantastic environments, characters, and stories. the community surrounding this game is great as well, giving it plenty of replayability.",3
"one of the best game ive ever played, so worth the money",1
"i quite love skyrim. as my first elder scrolls game i have nothing to base my opinion of the series but for the game itself ive never played such an imersive and rather addicting game, ive had it for a year or two now and i still havent found everything there is (granted i reset quite a bit to try new characters)and even if it did get slow its community and high moddability put new twists on it so you can never really be bored unless you just dont like these types of games. i do like the fighting system over other auto target type fighting systems as well.",2
"put a bucket over a shopkeepers head, then i stole everything. 10/10 would use bucket again.",2
"rating: tubular, dude! this game summs up all together a game that i would most like to play. its got the lush landscapes ranging from snowy ice caps to heated boggs, its got the emmense gameplay that keeps you hanging on wanting to see more, and it even has the traditional elder scrolls lag after youve downloaded too many cbbe mods. i simply love this game, and cant wait to see what else bethesda can crap all over us to make money. although, id rather play super mario brothers 2.",2
"i love the elderscrolls seires and when this came out i was stoked i played for hours on end this is the bomb.but i think this should be for macs also thats all i would change",1
"made an argonian and spent my lifetime in a lake 10/10",1
"playing, too busy looking at my characters boobs. <3 10/10",1
"skyrim, you bane of time management. skyrim, you bane of my life. skyrim, you bane of my boredom. skyrim, you bane of my strife. oh look, that rhymed.",1
"like this game so much. it is super when you can just walk accept quests and kill everyone do anything. 9/10 little bugs not that good graphics but... it is old game... and it is still super playable :d",1
"im sure youve heard all the hype and well... to be honest its all true. one of the best games of this generation.",1
"ok i think everyone knows what i have to say about this game... i love almost all the bethesda games, so there is no surprise that i love this game. skyrim is just another one of bethesdas master pieces in my opinion, this is a true open world experience with so many choices, i do kinda like this game a little better then some on the fallout games because of open world, in skyrim you can keep walking and find a ton of stuff (caves, quests, towns, etc), where in fallout there is not too much to find. so i would give skyrim a 10/10 just because of how amazingly awsome it is. also steam workshop yaaaaaaay!",1
"in the eyes of a ranger, the unsuspected stranger had better know the truth of wrong from right, cause the eyes of a ranger are upon you, any wrong you do hes gonna see, when youre in texas look behind you, cause thats where the rangers are gonna be!",1
"the most awesome rp game to ever exist. killing dragons, bandits, and exploring an open-world game with stunning graphics is just the best.",1
"play through it once legit, then abuse cheats the rest of the playthroughs.",1
"best game ever! this game will give you hundreds of playtime, side-quest and amazing story line. absolutely worth of money but dont forget to buy all dlcs - they are better than basic game :d",1
"300 hours + says it all. this game is addicting, sometimes in an unhealthy way. the easy with which one can play over 100 hours of skyrim is astounding. i paid full price for this game right when it came out and have never questioned my purchase, even when i saw it on steam this weekend for $7.50",2
"great game! huge world seemingly endless tasks. one of the best games ive played! graphics are great too!",1
"funtastic. just bought the dlcs looking forward to playing them",1
"this game is the true meaning of the word epic. it is a beautiflu adventure, has great gameplay, and enough content to last 5 years (when the next game comes out hopefully) the only thing i can find wrong with it is that you cant kill the children without a mod. but mods are easy to install with the workshop so it does not even matter. buy this now.",1
"player.placeatme 00064b33 500 cheese! cheese for everyone!",1
"a very well done rpg with lots of dragons, magic and weapons, a nice open world. would like to see a bit more variation in outside environments though.",1
"one of the best rpg these days!!! its so complex that perfectly takes you into that world.",1
"solid game with hours of potential play time...lots of fun",2
"biggest game ive ever seen my laptop can handle it so i give it an a+ it has so many mods that can add so much content and fun when combined!",3
"make sure to pack heavy because once you enter the world of skyrim, youre not going to be leaving any time soon.",1
"if you like oblivion, then you are going to love this. id recommend this to any rpg fans, or those of the elder scrolls series. ive already logged 20+ hours in it, and intend on spending many more.",1
"a cultural phenomenon, and probably the best game ever made. tops my list, anyway.",3
"a great game if you dont like certain limits, and being able to play even if you finish the main story.",1
"this game... this freakin game! never has a game pulled me in like this one. the voice acting is good, combat is fun, the story is engrossing. i cant imagine anyone being on the fence about this game - but if some reason you are, buy it and know youve made a fantastic purchase.",1
"love this game and its hard to stay as a board and sword/dw/ or even 2hand",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best elder scrolls out there. it has almost a endless amount of fun and quests, also has a good amount of armor on the game you can find or create, and has a good level-up system as it includes perks for many types of things as in smithing magic armor weapons etc etc... also has many followers you can earn from missions and also has many roleplaying game system that a lot of epic games have also has many things to choose from and a epic story line aswell and also has the steam workshop. i highly recommand this to anyone that loves roleplaying games.",1
"this is my all time favorite game. if you love fantasy genre then this is the game for you.",1
"if you enjoy medieval type of fighting, hours of gameplay, open world, and heavily moddable, this game is perfect. having played this game on ps3 for about 500 hours then playing it on my brother account for about 50 hours then 100+ on my account, the game is addicting and a perfect game to buy.",1
"i both recommend and dont recommend skyrim. i recommend because gameplay is fun (modded), its kinda fun to fight dragons (modded), and the world is huge (bigger when modded). i dont recommend because the graphics are really ugly without pretty heavily modding the game, and parts are still broken requiring additional mods...basically, the entire game relies almost entirely on mods to be anything you were expecting from the elder scrolls. the final reason i dont recommend is because you would have to give bathesda money for a game that is only any good because unpaid fans of the franchise have made it the game it should have been in the first place.",2
"skyrim is a good game all around with the main quest and all the side quests. but if you want a better game with more armor and weapons and make skyrim seem like a survival game, mod it! frostfall, immersive armors and weapons, enhanced blood are just a few mods that make the game better!",1
"so much to do, good old classic sandbox game set in a viking inspired world. highly recommend for anyone looking for a very expansive game with almost limitless gameplay.",1
"fantastic game for both 1st person, and 3rd person gamers.",1
"i am a long-time fan of the elder scrolls series, and they have been putting out game after game for years. each time a new game comes out, it pushes the limit of the gamers experience. this game is no different, 50 hrs of gameplay will pass before you know it.",1
"hands down this is my favorite adventure/rpg ive ever played. being highly customizable with community mods is what keeps me coming back to this gem. the graphics are stunning and the gameplay is top notch. just like when purchasing a car, i judge games i play on how they feel. when i play this game, i can get lost in its world for hours at a time. while the gameworld itself has vast depth, the story itself is lackluster. bethesda has a habit of making interesting and deep worlds, but shallow characters and storylines. if they could master how to make characters feel real and like your character is part of an unfolding story, rather than the centerpiece by which the world revolves around, i would probably quit my job and play their games without eating, drinking, and/or defacating. myself and my couch would become one and together we would rule tamriel together.",2
"step 1: mod this game to look stunning and beautiful. step 2: never leave the house again. ...because it will never achieve the glorious beauty of a modded skyrim. water will never look as good. youll grow jaded to the joys of being outside in actual sunshine. plus you cant be dovahkiin in real life, and that is just utterly awful to think about.",1
"love this game. i played alot on my 360 but breaking down and getting it for the pc was a great descision. i already am a big fan of tes games dating back to daggerfall but this one is just splendid... and thats just the vanilla game. just about anything you want to change can be with the tons of mods on the workshop and nexus and it makes the game seem even more personal because you made it just how you wanted it. before modding i would give it a 9/10, after a solid 10/10 its a great game in its own right but with the addition of mods it goes from great to amazing.",2
"endless gameplay and amazing mods. game is incredible. tons to do. definitely one of the classics.",1
"nice game, one of the best so far. but seriusly, you have to buy the legendary edition, you wont regret it.",1
"one of the best action rpg games so far, as bethesda has once again managed to expand the elder scrolls saga - this time with norse-themed adventure named after the frozen, snowy tundrous province skyrim. altrough not so original like its predecessors - oblivion or morrowind - the newest addition to this wonderful series is heavily influenced by nordic and scandinavian folklore. while morrowind was the most original place ive ever visited in game, and oblivion managed to bring the feeling of imperial rome - skyrim takes a different - albeit very common and not-so-original path - dragons, huscarls, fjords, hargravens and its own version of valhalla - sovngarde. pack your winter clothing - dont forget to bring your axes and horned helmets, and... be prepared for excellence - but not perfection, as skyrim tries to grasp the throne of rpg genre - but it still cannot best its older, more mature (and in my opinion flawless) siblings - morrowind and oblivion.",1
"one of the all time greatest open world adventure games made if you havent played it buy it!",1
"if this game was a potato, it would be a good potato.",1
"oh boy, heres an interesting one. now this one is going to be hard to describe in a small paragraph. skyrim is a big sandbox game where you go around, killing dragons, bandits, and even guards. you choose whether or not youd like to be a good guy or a bad guy (though i prefer to stay neutral so i dont have to choose between the two). you can join the companions, become a werewolf, and be badass. or you can become an assassin for the dark brotherhood and totally kick some  while earning a fair amount of cash all together. like i said, i cant put it all into one paragraph. but if your computer can handle it, or you have a console (and like medieval/fantasy games) i highly recommend this game.",1
"------------------------------------------------------- thai ---------------------------------------------------      xd -----------------------------------------------------eng------------------------------------------------------ ( if you play this game. you will know it. highlights of the game is not merely clear a main mission to accomplish.in sub quest.you can see the details of the game as well as the relationships between the characters.it allows us to know many things in the game such as the history of each character, the source of the association. or even the reason for the conflict between the society and others. sometimes your choices may affect the relationship with the npc in the game as well. so think twice before choosing the answer to. lastly, have fun with the game. xd )",1
"i do like the game but there are a few small bugs that you notice when you first start but as you play the game more you learn how to combat them but a bug that i have now discovered is that everything has dissapeard of the screen my compass,stamina,magica,health,subtitles and crosshairs along with the sneaking eye im not sure if it is a mod that is doing this but it works on a differant computer if anyone knows a fix for this i would like to hear it but other than that the game has been great the wolves falling out of the sky was a great thing as well (it was a bug that came with hearthfire after i had built my house) i would recommend if you have a mid end to high end pc otherwise it doesnt look that good nut is still a good game 7/10",1
"no doubt the best game i have ever played. there is no need to say anything else.",1
"skyrim is not the best in terms of game play compaired to other elder scrolls but it does get the good stuff right and gets rid of all the old bad stuff. get this game and morrowind you wont regret it.",2
"this game shouldnt really need an explaination as to why you should buy it. just get it.",1
"this game is awsome and a must play when you buy the game your going to have a awsome time playing and if you get bored then get mods on the steam workshop thay will inprove your gameplay :) so good job steam ten outa ten beat buy evar waring:game will cause lost of social live and events.",1
"impressive graphics, deep deep story arc and sub arcs, factions, etc. hours and hours of playtime. pro: you have to listen to the game sounds as part of battle tactics, rare among games. con: you will fnd bugs. pro: the wiki helps you get past most of them, and more.",4
"this is a must have for any type of gamer, if people tell you otherwise, their honestly impared in some way. anyway, do not, here me, do not let the massiveness of this game let you feel like there is no way of beating it. there is, it just takes time to get settled in, and by settling in, i mean playing the game a week or two. soon youll find yourself addicted to the beautiful yet massive game known as the elder scrolls v: skyrim john~10/10",1
"you say just five more minutes then you end up playing for 3 hours.",1
"a great game with a lot of replay value with a extensive modding community both on steam workshop and on the nexus.",1
"i have this game on the ps3, and that is mostly what i played it on before i built my pc. this game is fantastic, i have over 650 game hours on my ps3 alone. it never really gets old. be careful though, it is very addictive.",1
"ever time now when i play this it keeps closing any help?",1
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"please everyone go buy this game! i love it! i can not get enough of this amazing gameplay!",1
"300+ hours of playtime later i can certainly say that skyrim has quite a bit of content... its a vast expansive and ridiculously pretty completely open world filled with monsters, ruins, interesting stories and just so much stuff to fight, explore and loot. plus if you ever run out f stuff to do, theres the workshop with a near-infinite supply of very decent user created content. for me itll always be something ill return to every once in a while. id guess the only downsides to this game are the fact that the main questlines (as opposed to say, oblivion) are somewhat on the short side and that the population of skyrim is a bit scarce (youd really expect to run into just a few more people in the capitals), also watch out for the random vampire attacks with dawnguard that will decimate your population if youre a bit unlucky (mods can fix that though).",2
"walked into cave, got mauled by a bear. 10/10 would play again. ps: my old account has over 4000 hours on this game. mod it and have the best time of your life.",1
"i bought this game for $60 and now its at $20 what is this",1
"my favourite game by far, only have 150 hours on it on my pc at this point buy i have over 400 on my ps3, its awesome, the questing is epic, graphics are really good with some mods on it, gameplay is great(would be better if it looked like chivalry a bit more but meh) and the lore, oh god the lore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"i have 650 played hours in this gameand id recommend skyrim to anyone who like rpgs, the main game can get a bit boring at times, but there is a lot you can do in this game other then the quest and such. seeing as the game came out in 11/11/11 there is a vast amout of mods to also keep you coming back for more that add things like weapons, arrmor and spells, to how it looks and plays. also see as it has been out for more then 3 years there is not a lot that has not been said about this game. if you have not picked it up yest and you wanted to id say go for it",3
"youll start out not caring much about, but after a couple hours youll be wanting to explore everything skyrim has to offer! a must have game hands down!",1
"plain and simple its another part in the skyrim saga thing.... pretty freaking awesome too if i dont say so myself. if you like multiple abilitiy trees with a semi-complex system, pick-pocketing people, fighting dragons, and being an all-around badass then more than likely youll enjoy skyrim. i own this on my xbox and have completely beat it and obtained every acheivement and i bought it on pc so i could do it all over again with mods, graphical enhancers, and play it when traveling. 94/100 if you ask me and im still probably understating how good this game is",1
"the mods available for this game, make it a much better experience on pc. better textures, more sounds, incredible immersion on top of the incredible job the game did already. quite simply a must-have for any rpg fan.",1
"youre not cool if you dont love the tes series, this one tops the list, with the exception of being a fukn console port.... bethesda you have really let down the true tes followers (consoles are obsolete, quit ruining the pc gaming world)",1
"an excelent game that provides a world that is so detailed, so immersive that one would think they are in another world. the combat system is interesing and easy to grasp, while providing playing styles unique to the player. i whole-heartedly recommend this game to others.",1
"i dont know how to express this enough. this is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you are thinking about getting it get it! in fact if you dont even want it get it! if you are alive you should get this game! if you are dead you should get this game! this game will channge your life!!!",2
"skyrim, an awesome rpg! you fight  and then you get  its its brillint i mean i shouldnt even be ing recommanding right know thats how ing awesome this game is i mean its better then",2
"best game i have ever played, if you havent played it, go for it!!!",1
"skyrim is an all around great game, but it doesnt feel like a proper elder scrolls game. although it has the same mechanics as previous installments, the shouts make it feel like a different game and the dragons make it seem more generic. dual-weilding was a nice touch though. the fact that you didnt need a class and all skills could level you up was a much needed change in my opinion, and the marriage system and adoption system in the hearthfire dlc, add a sense of realism to the game.",1
"such an amazing game and its even better when you can get tons of awesome mods!",1
"what can i possibly say that hasnt already been said ? this is possibly my favourite game that i have ever played. i cant find one single fault. immersion, story, characters, atmosphere, longevity - the list goes on. if you are one of the few that hasnt played skyrim then just do it now.",1
"if your bored and want to beat the  out of dragons, try this game. :p",1
"the most immersive and brilliantly composed game ive ever explored. i have lost count of the replays, but i can say each time i explore it anew it is just as thrilling as the the first. in the extremely implausible event that i could only have one game, this would be it without regret. most games, when i have finished them i never touch them again, even if i enjoyed them immensely. not so with skyrim.",2
"by far my favorite game in years. you can do no wrong by getting this! worth every penny. endless custimization and the best single player game out there! get it!!!",2
"this game may be a old, but it still does not stop amazing me. the story line is epic and when you finish the main ones there are still a dozen plus more that you can enjoy. if this is the only way that i can thank you elder scrolls. -cameron-",2
"fus. ro. dah. excessively huge, infinitely moddable, a world you can and will literally get lost in.",1
"giant smashs you with a club and you take a ride to the moon best game ever 11/10",1
"pretty fun, a bit buggy without a few patches but thats to be expected. i had more fun doing my own thing instead of the story quests. overall rating... 7/10",2
"this is exactly what rpg fans are looking for. the world is vast and intricate, theres a lot of characters youll remember and the leveling system really focuses on what you want to do as you do it. its by far one of the best and most addictive games ever.",1
"this game is amazing! best rpg of its time imo! also has an amazing and active modding community, who help bring the game to life i give the elder scrolls v: skyrim a 10/10!",1
"ive modded this game for 3years. as vanilla maybe not that good, but when you start modding it, even the graphics look beast. this game + all of ultimate  mods = (   ) shout out to loverslab modders, keep up the hard work (   )",1
"this is amazing ! :3 tons of fun awaiting you in the world of skyrim :d lots of diffrent missions, companions, mods in the workshop :) and loots of other stuff :d",2
"an amazing game with an awesome story/stories. theres so much to do that you can easily put 150+ hours in without touching the main plots.",1
"lots of fun. really enjoy how you can interact with items in the game (i.e. lockpicking).",1
"skyrim is my most played game and thats not including my xbox and ps3 character. i love all the things you can do and the side quests to beat",1
"cant say enough good things about this game, i love it to pieces, its impossible to get bored!",1
"in my opinion, skyrim is a very entertaining rp game with a nice ploot line, and in my opinion, i love games that differ based on the players decisions. skyrim is one of those games, and you ae open to many different oppurtunities no matter where you decide to go. i cant think of much else to say but, yes i believe skyrim is worth the money!",1
"report yourself ill from work, lock yourself in the basement and prepare to forsake all social intercourse rest of the year. skyrim is finally here and 300 hours of first-class role-playing entertainment lies ahead of you in a frozen, viking-inspired winter kingdom.",1
"though i havent played it much on the pc this game is a beautiful, fun, and over the top creative rpg. if you like rpgs or fantasy games this should be your next game.",1
"this is the best open-world game ive ever played and i never got tired of playing it because it does not end you can play and play it will always stay entertaining...and with the steam workshop you can download mods that make the game funny and add stuff from movies...and in conclusion if you dont have this game get it now.",2
"steam workshop makes it a millon times better, console commands make it possible to work around game breaking bugs, and its just better overall",1
"killed a dragon. celebrated by smacking a giant around. he gave me flying lessons. 10/10 would fly again",1
"omg this game has consumed my life for days and i been modded mopsting of the time just started playing 12 hours ago and i just stopped thanks skyrim now ima be lifeless for a while",1
"i dont like fantasy but still i have lost about 150 hrs of a life here. i spent about first 20 hrs in warez version and then went to shop to buy xd",1
"the game is just ok. this game has so many bugs in it its ridiculous. this is the only game i know of where if i am looking at its wikipedia site, i specifically go to the bug section to see if what happened or what i want to do is a bug or not. i told myself id beat this game when i started(not just the main questline but all quests) and im close enough to completion (non dlc) that im done. i felt that i was bored throughout the whole 100+ hours it took me to complete it. i would tell myself just keep going and get it over with so i can move onto the next game i tried mods but it didnt make it any better(except for skyui)",1
"i think myself and most of the rest of the world would recommend this game... lol. but no, seriously, i took a first look at this game, and said, nope... never gonna get me to play that. then my friend told me how good it was, and let me borrow it... and then i just had to buy it. if you havent played it- you will love it. i dont think it matters if youre an rpg, fps, rts, or whatnot, im pretty sure theres something for everyone in this game, the puzzles, the small stories, the quests... and its such a huge map, you can play this thing a few times, and still see different things each time. just a tip though, make sure you install at least the hd textures before you play, the graphics are a little dated. also, if youre a hardcore graphics person, youtube gopher and his series on how to mod skyrim. if you havent played it before, i wouldnt mod the gameplay at all- but feel free to mod the graphics systems to your hearts content! enb makes everything look so amazing in this game- the stars and the nightsky look so realistic, as well as the shadows and the direction lighting system.",1
"great game, best game i ever bought, despite all its flaws. its still relevant. damn good game.",1
"well what cant be said about skyrim, i have put more hours into this game than any other and i have still never beat it, there is so much to do and it is still so much fun.",1
"i need help whenever i want to play it it just goes to the bethesda screen and then its gone.will someone plz help?",1
"epic landscape and dungeons. story is like the other elder scrolls games, nice but nothing special. what keeps you going in this game is the loot, the sidequests an the exploring.",1
"good game i killed a dragon and found a flying mammoth",1
"great story ect. also dont forget to install the 2k hd texture patches, really mkeas a great difference",1
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"just around 4 dollar for legendary edition !! (this game discount often so dont buy it when full prices) i think this game isnt good enough (because a lot of bug) but there have mod it useful for fullfill everything that you need and fix every bug and then trust me you will became a mod addiction if you play this game without mod i can tell you the original game is suck! (in my opinion)",1
"this game is just essential for any gamer wanting to make that leap from casual gaming to hardcore gaming, it is by no means a hardcore game, but, oh man, its a good game",1
"very intriguing, breath taking and utmost interesting game that i have ever played. the reason why this game is so interesting is the game simulator, which is what makes this game a dynamic one, based on actual variables instead of following scripts and predefined gameplay.",1
"this game is awesome.variational{my new word hehe}",1
"great game totally worth getting 100s of hours gameplay and more if u have the money to get do it !!!!",1
"i killed a chicken, the whole village tried to kill me, i ended up killing the whole village. /10",1
"stole a plate and got killed next time i misclicked, still got killed 14/12 would listen to darude sandstorm again!",1
"open world, this game is like a country in one download. rpg created for the fps fan.",2
"this game is absolutely amazing, my favorite game of all time. the combat, the story, the characters, love everything about it. buy it!",2
"i love this game. the world is huge and full of things to do and see. characters are varied and interesting. loot is satisfying. and the mods... my god. honestly, i couldnt enjoy skyrim in its vanilla state. the combat is boring for me, so got the ulitmate combat mod. that was the first mod i got. since then, ive got a whole lot more and theyve really improved the game a whole lot for me. vanilla skyrim is good, but with mods (in my opinion) the game can become so much more immersive and enjoyable. my favorite open world rpg to date. oh yeah, and its theme is one of the best in any game ever :d",1
"killed a chick, then the whole town came running after me with kitchen knives... 10/10 would die again.",1
"this game is my favorite game ever it dose not take much to run it, it has amazing replay value, and it is over all a very action packed game. if you like open worald games this is the game for you. you can build youre character in any way you please it could be a hevey knight a stealthy assasin or a badass mage and its not like in dragon age where you simply chose what kind of class you want you can upgrade skills no matter what you try to be.",1
"i think i like skyrim even better than heavily modded morrowind. thats saying a lot.",4
"amazing. immersive. a huge map with enemies galore. many quests to keep you continously occupied for hours on end. truly a well made game.",1
"just think of that first ten-second feeling of juicy fruit. put that into a video game and here it is. 10/10",3
"i have about 150 hours writing this review and though im sure many have more by now seeing as how the game is two and a half years old, but i can say i have yet to actually finish the main story. there are so many things to do, place to go, towns to rob blind, priests in whiterun to brutally murder over and over only to restore their screaming with the consol. and then theres all this other stuff like dragons, magic, and giants that used to bounce you like the ground was a trampoline.",1
"what is there to say? its elder scrolls! its skyrim! a large open world, tons of places to explore, plenty of armor and weapon sets, and enough quests to keep you busy for a while. even better, modding! with tons of mods, you can keep busy forever. you can use the steam workshop or, as i prefer, the nexus site. the fight against the thalmor series, immersive armor and weapons, frostfall, skyui, and even 2k textures! what are you waiting for? its on sale constantly!",1
"good fantasy game with a good main story but even if the main vases vases pib get tired you can do side quests like to join a guild to kill someone or zvate hunt for fun but now the game has bags like that you piece-figure bugno the rocks or that it will kill an animal but otherwise very good game! i recommend",1
"if you havent played then ermagohd 10/10 lol just doing this for a badge :p",1
"amazing game. amazing lore. a huge amount of stuff to explore through and a huge map. awesome leveling up and engaging dialogue. hundreds, if not thousands of quests with different endings for many of them. incredible detail in everything you explore. hundreds of mods. what more could a gamer want to sink their teeth into? 10/10",1
"such open world a so much to do. beauftifull music and great graphics. only thing that isnt perfect are npc and story i dont remeber them and i dont care about them witch is shame. 9/10",1
"cant believe it has been 3 years since this game came out. still addictive as f**k , huge modding community makes it a lot better and optimization is really good. infinite possibilities.",1
"amazing. so many hours of gameplay to join the amazing story and world. (not including all the mods you can install) just get it. give steam your monies. theyre waiting...",1
"what really is there to say? the elder scrolles franchise once more doesnt fail to dissapoint but now its back and better than ever. the world is gigantic, showing insane scale and beautiful scenery from the high mountains to the waterfalls. locations absolutely crowd the map (in a good way), leaving you on your own to carve a path into the game as you see fit. near endless customization adds to the immersion and bethesdas standing concept of the power of choice. whether wizard, warrior, or theif, this game will not fail to immerse you in its deep and awestriking stories. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the richest, largest, beautiful, best games i have ever experienced.",1
"epic gameplay with a so-so story some bugs and glitches but with countless mods on the nexus and the steam workshop there is almost endless replay value.",4
"do not buy this buy legends if u want a completely full set of expansions and a new mode and etc if u want full gaming dont buy this",2
"this is possibly one of the best games ive ever played!",1
"its a wonderful game! who dont want a spider horsy?",1
"i dont think i need to convince you to purchase this.",1
"i play this game with 8 giant fans pointed towards my genitals to retain immersion so i can pretend im in the snowy mountains with my character dongbeetle420 10/10",1
"fun role playing game to have on your computer great charater creation great graphics and great gameplay.",1
"beautiful game, but shallow non-interactive world and boring combat...10/10 but seriously, even with major bugs, and lots of them, skyrim is the one game that can make me just lose myself in a gameworld. if you have played previous games in tes, you should love all of the references youll find in this. and why do you not own it yet?",2
"hours and hours of vikingy fun, from helping some poor bugger out by doing a quest or ing up some villagers day by going apache on their asses this game has it all, ever wanted to hit a mud crab with a ? well now you can! the workshop has a vast amount of mods that make my crotch tingle at the thought of what i can aspire to do. the possibilities are endless you son of a ! now download this game!!!!",1
"the most immersive gaming experience you could possibly hope for. well over 100+ hours of content. 10/10",1
"it is a very good game but get boring after every things done",1
"buy the game, it is wonderful. ive sunk so much time into this game and havent even begun the main story yet. plus with the workshop support it makes mods so easy to install.",1
"i can totally lose myself in this game. however after a while it get a bit predictable and i wish that it would have a better controller support. still i absolutely love this game and i hope that the next installment is just as good",1
"engaging quests, excellent graphics, loveable mechanics and an outstanding world in which to experience it. of course, despite all the quests and stories they offer, perhaps the ability to totally ignore it all and shout people off of cliffs for six hours straight is what makes the whole experience so great.",1
"77/100 pros: -open world -lots of loot -fun gameplay -lots of game time -great workshop stuff. cons: -bad pc menu -meh graphics (vanilla)",1
"the best, most fun and legendaryst game ever made!!!! buy it now. multiplayer coming soon!!!",1
"you need to read the reviews? as in: you havent bought skyrim already? wow.",1
"this is an amazing game and i reccomend it to anyone who likes mideval fantasy books/games.",1
"wonderful just wonderful best game ever!!!!!! exept steam updated and i cant use mods it says failed to enumerate subscribed files",1
"if youve ever read an old scroll, thats equivalent to playing skyrim. 11/10 would level up again.",1
"dear bethedsa, i absolutely 100% love this game! but there is one major major issue with it. the updates!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! even when i switch it to do not update, it updates automatically. maybe you should figure out a way to... say skyrim needs an update and then have a yes or no option. please read this and consider it, i will appreciate it if you did. -invaderchaos",3
"i love this game! its so fun and addicting, and i have not even passed it! the sheer size of the game, the amount of npcs, the details, their all awesome. even though my computer is slow, it only takes about 40 seconds for the game to launch. some things are messed up, such as the chin detail, but that doesnt get in the way of the rest of the game. the dova provide fun boss battles if you arnt too strong, and shouts are fun to use. one thing i do hate are guard warnings (im going to have to ask you to stop). companions are fun to have around, but it gets annoying if they randomly die, same thing with horses. enchanting is fun. in general the game is fun. 9.8/10",1
"this game is awesome, especially with the right mods!",1
"if your computer can handle it, youd be crazy not to buy this. very fun game.",1
"a classic open world game. by far the best on pc due to the excellent modding community. the main story and combat are indeed mediocre, but this game is all about pulling you into its world. one of my all time favs!",2
"what ive learned from my, so far, few hours of playing: lydia is so ing annoying. nevermind that though, because this game is completely wonderful. im really glad i picked up on this when i did, because now im addicated. this will soon take over my most hours in a game. i reccomend buying this. and if you happen to get lydia as your little slave, i will pray for you. god bless. not really.",1
"this game is great for free roam game fans. the main storyline in the game is great, and so are all the other game quests you can do. the fact that you can become an assasin, warrior, mage, alchemist, or enchanter is pretty cool. i love this game.",1
"across pc and xbox ive probably sunk well over 300 hours into skyrim. if you count watching friends play it too, itd be closer to 500. the only game i might have sunk more hours into would be halo, and even then thats across 7 games, not one. best game of the last decade. easily.",1
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",1
"its elder scrolls what more could you expect other then pure perfection. if you even liked the elder scrolls: oblivion you should play this game, so much to do and every new game you start with a new charcter is like a new game all over. there is so much to exploer and every single town, dungeon, any place really is so unique. i have no reason to right a good review because this game came out weve all heard it a million times, this is game is perfection!",1
"this game is amazing, if i where to say how amazing, it would be an article not a review.",1
"almost never ending goodie goodness, best cabbage collecting-simulator i have ever played. 10 out of 10 cabbages.",1
"forget about oblivion. skyrim is a true heir to morrowind!",5
"one of the best games ever in my opinion and its even better with mods its a must have!",1
"this is honestly the greatest game i have ever played. i enjoyed every second of it. it is beautifully designed, and there are so many ways to play this game. 10/10.",1
"in the top ten games ever for me. (ive actually played like 400 hours, this is just a different account) its beautiful, fun, and even more fun to mod!",1
"this might possibly be one of the greatest rpgs of all time. i would buy this in a heartbeat and im sure some of you agree. this game will always be remembered. the modding community has kept this game alive and still going strong for nearly five years. if you want an open world rpg thats immersive, has an amazing soundtrack, and want to be lost in the large amounts of lore this series has to offer, get it. its the game for you. you can also expand your experience with the dlcs. unlike its console ports, tesv features an unprecidented amount of mods that can add hours and hours to the total play time. i took a moment on plenty of occassions to take in the views from throat of the world. its on of the only games that has a truly beatiful (and mod-able) skybox, with stars and moons giving light at night, along with nice shadows cast in the trees down in falkreath. i also killed braith, hiding her body on a building (hiding) 10/10- like far cry 3 with bows -ign",1
"amazing game. if you are a sick nerd baller with the cravings for living in an alernate fantasy world, sign right up.",3
"many have compared this game to dragon age, the witcher and even oblivion. however, the style of game is closest to another fairly recent bethesda game. quite simply, it is fallout 3 with swords and magic.",1
"good but theres loads of glichies but over all a good game.",1
"this is one awesome game... you should get it as soon as possible :p asn hra.... jendoznane si ju kp hne ako bude mc, nebude utova.",1
"good game, but something is missing... maybe im just so big fan of these medieval/fantasy-themed rpgs anymore... anyway, messing with mods is fun! 6/10 9/10 with good mods",1
"somewhere better than oblivion, somewhere worse than morrowind, somewhere somewhere better than both of them. and in general one of the best games of all time (great world, excellent story, fantastic gameplay, high level design, nice interaction with the world).",1
"now dont be fooled that i only have a tiny bit of time invested in this game because that counter is a lie. this game is good enough that i have three saves, all level 50 or higher, on my xbox 360 and still was willing to buy it on steam. the emersion that i feel while playing this game is the deepest and most satisfying out of any of the hundreds of games i have tried. no matter how much i play this game there is always something to do, someone to meet, and a quest to finish. overall this is my second favorite game after dota 2, but unlike dota 2 i know why i love skyrim (see above).",1
"an open world and engaging environment provide the setting for a game that allows you to explore and discover. this is one monster of an rpg.",1
"this game is massively expansive and has a huge modding community that allows for just about any content changes, from graphical improvements to full conversion mods. it is a personal favorite of mine and many others. if you havent played it yet you are missing out.",1
"this game just keeps getting better and better as you progress through the story. i have no complaints. i can honestly say ive never sat and played a game as much as i have been doing with this one. im hooked.",1
"having never played the preceding games of this saga, i didnt really know what i was getting into. skyrim is one of the funnest and most enjoyable games out there. you can log so many hours on this game. and, if you finish the main quest and begin to get bored, you can explore the mods. would definitely recommend!",1
"i could never get into previous elder scrolls games, but had a greatly different experience with skyrim. i highly recommend this game, even to those who have not be fans of the series in the past.",1
"played this more on the xbox than pc, however its an amazing open world rpg. if you are looking for an open world, rpg, exploration, and freedom in class customization than this is for you. it is by far one of the most amazing looking games of its time and still is today. skyrim also has some of the best side missions in an open world rpg where you feel like they matter instead of simple fetch quests. if you have ever played any of the past elder games than this is a no brainer. the only down side for me was the lack of gear that mattered that could be found in the world randomly. its not like fallout where you can find a rare weapon out in the world. all the best gear is laid out before you, all you have to do is craft it. i would recommend buying it, because at this price you will get 100s of hours of gameplay.",1
"dragon appears in town, all the town guards, follower and i start attacking it, shout at dragon, hit guard accidentally with shout, all guards turn on me, get killed by guards. 10/10",1
"its skyrim. this is my thrid time buying this game.",1
"a huge, expertly crafted and insanely detailed fantasy adventure with literally hundreds of hours of gameplay and thats without even touching the main quest line. an excellent modding community also helps to build on what is already a great game. 10/10.",1
"i loved it now im hopeing for watchdogs if someone would be nice and give it to me your money according to you woulnt be wasted o_o but yes i love rateing out of 10 i 1000 =3",1
"wide as a field. shallow as a spoon. but hey, it does have great mods like s of skyrim!",1
"who does not want to shout at people and blow them away? no one! get this game get awesome mods to increase the awesomeness! you can be a cat that cat meow and that ignites them on fire! cmon! get! this! game!",3
"this game is amazing. there is so much to do and even when you think you are done theres more side quests and mods to further enhance the game play. two thumbs up.",2
"a great free roaming game with multiple paths and choices. youre free to live your life however you please, chosing when to relax, play, or run one of many campagns.",1
"huge world to explore and a wealth of mods. hours and hours and hours of enjoyment possible.",3
"can honestly say that the only things ive actually completed for storyline qwest was the archmage, stormcloake/imperial (both storylines) and the theives guild. everything else i havent complete, own all the dlc. not because i dont want to play the qwest line, but because ive spent so much time free roaming the map and completing all the side qwest instead of the story ones. i will say that mods is a must for this game as the original vanilla gameplay/graphics/npc is very vague and also gets really repeditive with hack and slash/magic powers. mods will 100% make your gameplay experience alot more funner, enjoyable and at times just stop to look at your character and go man......my character is awesome!!!",2
"you will not regret a cent when you buy this game, there is so much to see and do. not to mentions mods, which can easily give one playthrough thousands upon thousands of hours of playtime. you need to get this game, there has not been any other western rpg like it sence its release and there probibly will not be anytime soon. not untill elder scrolls vi comes around.",1
"do yourself a favour and lose yourself in one of the greatest rpgs ever made. a breathtakingly beautiful fantasy world, full of rich and in-depth quests and combat, skyrim will stand the test of time and win your heart; one shout, level-up and arrow in the knee at a time.",1
"i downloaded mods for boobs....they look real good",1
"yes. yes. and yes. dont expect your hand to beld or a linear path at all. its not. you do some story missions, then you do factions missions, then back to the story missions, then do another factions missions. so much. at 40 hours i had done like 1/4 of the story missions, and completed 2 out of like 10 factions missions. (the companions and the dark brotherhood). there is so much to do. gotta say it took me about 4 times to get into it though.",1
"found a mod that makes chickens explode. played hide and seek with a mud crap. chased a rabbit off a cliff. 10/10 would chase that rabbit again.",1
"at first, i was going to sit here and try to list out all of the things that make skyrim amazing, but realized that a) this review would never end and b) the game speaks better for itself than any person ever could. the graphics are decent, but with the right mods can be downright gorgeous. gameplay is fairly fluid, although i personally could never enjoy the speed of playing a caster in skyrim, and storylines in quests are very immersive, but still can have a grinding feel like most rpgs. ive played this game a lot between pc and xbox 360, and there really are very few games that can compare.",1
"great game that offers lots of freedom for the player and lots of hours of entertainment",2
"this game gave me a modding addiction, i now have 211 mods.",1
"amazing game ! endless hours of gameplay and quests with loads of in game roleplaying potential. you can buy a house settle down with a wife ,pillage towns,pickpocket kings, teebag guards i would recomend this game to anyone. and with the dawn guard dlc the infinate world of skyrim just got bigger ! in this amazing free roaming adventure. world of advice dont become a vampire ! (well unless you want people trying to kill you all the time) this amazing game will challenge you with traps and puzzles and from a horrific monster down to a lowly skever it captures the minds of children and adults alike. wow ! i have lost so many hours playing this wonderous game unlimited potenital and a diverse range of weapons ranging from a bow and arrow to a fireball and staff exellent role playing compatibility, and praticaly endless quests and fun to be honest :)",1
"great game! i cant wait till the workshop community completes the vardenfel island of morrowind!!! elderscrolls 3 is still my most preferred and skrimm is super close in playability and enjoyability!!!",2
"a game about the dragonborn in his quest to save the world from the end of the world. + many questlines + many quests + interesting main story + big map + customisable + offers the biggest amount of mods on nexus & steamworkshop + interactive + nice landscape + offers great roleplaying opportunities + classes + great skill tree -/",2
"hmm what to say about this game, its a good game, and with mod support its pretty much endless, id say about 20-200 hours of gameplay without mods",1
"300 hours of play so far. still fun and not even finished yet...",2
"i think this game is just so awesome because of the time you can put into it, and the awesome it radiates.",1
"this has on average like 20,000 people playing and has one too many awards to count. why the f*ck are you even reading this bro?",1
"shout nordic profanity at dragons until they die- 10/10 (+ great multiplayer, beat faze clan like twice)",2
"ive put more hours into this game than any other, the breadth of content avaliable thanks to the massive modding comunity is skyrims greatest strength. if you play this game with vanilla settings then it doesnt hold up and you can see that its showing its age, however with a wealth of readly avalibale mods you can create on of the best looking games on the market, tailored exactly to your tastes and if you find any of the mechanics of the game are substandard you can be sure someone has modified it to be to your standards. the game however is plagued by crashes and freezing issues with some of the mods either helping to stop them or causing them in the first place. its a huge issue and a decent debugging tool is noticably absent which makes pinpointing issues a herculean task. with hours of work and following multiple guides you can get a stable and beautiful looking game unmodified this game should get a solid 7/10 a fully modded games will surely get a 9/10 from anyone who is willing to put in all the hours of tweaking",2
"i am in love with this game, the fun never ends. the 3 main types of characters you can be have so much depth. plus you can combine 2 of the types or even 3. it is deffinatly a fun game. plus with all the mods you can get it makes it even more fun. take that console plebs",2
"my only gripe about this game is that the hearthfire dlc is almost worthless (thankfully its not expensive), and there are still numerous bugs abound in the game. otherwise, its not a bad game.",1
"who doesnt like a game when you can shout at dragons, absorb their souls, then use the souls to unlock more ways to shout at dragons...",1
"i only recommend skyrim in pc version only because of mods. pc community mod is what makes this game great. i honestly dont get why console version gets so much praise because skyrim is well...  without mods. skyrim without mod is glitchfest, boring, and non immpersive. mod is a must in this game. i recommend going to nexus site for mods to check and see which mod has high score and subsribe them in steam workshop. though i recommend just using nexus site and program to get/organize all the skryim mods",1
"late to the party, but loving this game. made even better with the 2k texture pack on my new pc.",1

"played skyrim for the 360. its a hell of a game. gaphics are great and game play is long. if you enjoy open world play its a must play. i spent over 100 hours playing it. loved it. i still like fallout 3 more but skyrim was a great for the melee play. i recommend this game!",1

"well, honestly, amazing rpg bethesda never fails at making a game. love em or hate em, its true.",1
"the game is fairly fun but if you go down the tank route (heavy armor and 2 handed) then you area basically (almost) invincible. but still its a lot of fun. altough adding a few mods to make the gameplay harder is always nice ;) 10/10",1
"very heroic, adventurous and exciting! this game is an rpg, adventure where you wonder around, visit temples, enter pubs, shops and all sorts! there is also a wide range of races to chose such as: argonian, breton, dark elf, high elf and much more! brilliant game! 10/10!",1
"skyrim is a great game........a really great game......",1
"skyrim is the best game habe it on the 360 and pc cant stop playing this game :)",1
"a sickness is upon this game, dragon sickness this game is a sickness. its like dragon sickness. like the thrain. you become a monster with this game. you will play it like 5 hours , then you gonna say yourself, i want to drink a cofee. while drinking cofee, you will just think about skyrim. while going to school/work etc. you will only think about skyrim. skyrim will be everything to you. you gonna love it and at the same time you gonna hate it. its like the one ring . this is the one game to rule all gamers. it will destroy your real life. in real world, you gonna think, i dont belong here , i belong to skyrim. and also skyrim belongs to the nords, dont forget that. and one last think: if you want to live in real world, if you have a good social life and a happy family life, do not play this game! this game will make you crazy! you can do whatever you wanna do in skyrim. even you can make your own world. you can mod everyting.(until it crashes.d) anyway i spent too much time writing this , i must return to skyrim ,alduin must be waiting for me . have fun.",1
"this is one of the most enjoyable singleplayer role playing games i have ever played. there is a lot of replayability and so much to do and discover. i run about wearing the bones of dragons i have slain and i lay waste and slaughter entire villages... whats not to love",1
"this game is huge, epic and breathtaking. ive never felt so immersed in a game before. go get it, but be cautious, this will drain your spare time before you notice",1
"if you are new to this game kill every chicken you see-trust me nothing bad will happen",1
"amazing game when you mod. i do sugest an amd series 7000 and up or nvidia gtx 430 and up.",2
"i know its 4 years late for me to write a review but i still meet people who have never played an elder scrolls game o_o! so for those looking at this...just buy it! this game is a masterpiece and we need more games like this. not to mention with the addition of mods makes skyrim that much better. somehow here on steam people have left negative reviews on skyrim. i dont even understand how skyrim can have a single negative review aginast it other than trolls buy the game 10000/10",2
"tons of stuff to do, the quest are fun. tons of mods. do whatever you want",1
"just started, amazing and beautiful!!! go get it!!!",1
"if this game isnt in your library, you should be ashamed of yourself.",1
"if somebody asked me what is the best game you ever played i immediately think of tes skyrim this game has it all story, quests, atmosphere, music everything about it is fantastic 10/10",2
"this is one of the best rpg ive played in a long time, so much to do and so much to exsplore, ofc as all bethesta games theres the normal bugs and crashes but hey the gameplay and storry makes it worth it =) an dif you mod it a lil tada bugs gone so i recomend taking 10 min to learn how to mod the game and get some mods to make it bether =)",4
"my favorite rpg ever, no doubt about it. ive never been so in love with any game like this.",1
"best game ive ever played, if you dont have it, buy it now",2
"so, my skyrim stopped working for some random reason, it starts by loading up, then i click continue and it starts to load up and then freezes.",1
"this game has so many issues how the hell did i almost put 100 hours into it. i got a mod that makes the music + sounds from zelda games, so that helps i guess.",1
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",1
"its skyrim. you can do pretty much anything. buy it already.",1
"slightly below decent/10 first few hours were incredible. an elderscrolls game with pretty good visuals? nice! gets boring fast, though, and the only thing i enjoy in the game is hunting books and reading on the lore that make the game universe sound better than what video games are capable of doing [or better than what devs are willing to do because they gotta cater to lowest common denominators to make a profit. which is essentially skyrim in a nutshell.] quests are boring as , yo. i hope you love trekking through caves willed with undead nords because thats essentially the majority of the game. story is meh, but most bethesda main stories are pretty much meh. also im not fond of dragons in fantasy since they feel so played out but im biased in that. combat is boring but thats not the main draw of tes games i havent played in a while so i dont know if they changed it, but the controls and ui is consolized as . thanks, ers, for ruining every franchise i ever loved. anyways, the setting is pretty boring, too, since its just another human centric generic fantasy slop. still worth a playthrough, but not for in 60 bucks lmao",1
"essentially everything you would want in a fantasy game setting. free play with guidance, smooth combat, and enough gameplay to keep you busy for months.",2
"no faults with it at all..maybe once in awhile youll run into a couple of bugs and glitches which are usually pretty funny and random when they happen but nothing really game breaking plus it gives you the choice to use your 360 controller in case you dont feel like using your keyboard,so basiclly if you love wide open world games and rpgs than this game is for you:d and dont forget the modding part;) skyrim is brilliant simple as that and with mods it makes this epic game even more brilliant:)",1
"skyrim is by far my favorite game of all time, its fighting, adventuring, npcs, and questing are all great",1
"by far one of the best rpgs ive played, and the mod integration makes it a truly versatile game. definately didnt write this for the summer sale...",1
"beautilful, unique, and charming... skyrim provides better experience of this rpg open-world series. beside the main quest and radiant sidequest which can surprise you in different events. pretty genuis scripts and storyline lead you to new places, new conflicts, and dragons as random encounter. the level system is not new, but it has improvement and design. places are full of mysteries, activites, and npcs, lifefull indeed. smithing and enchanting are deep and impact to your combat as magics and shouts are balanced and provide new tactics. i could say im in love with this fifth series. even some people may face with minor bugs (for me, it just minor graphic bugs now.) inventory system is hard to track (fix by using skyrim ui mod) and problem in ai direction. all i say it just common thing in this kind of game which cant interrupt you from amazing experience. totally worthy in every dollar/baht you paid. whatever you are fan of series or not. try once in your owned. :)",2
"i have crammed nearly 700 hours into skyrim! mods help replayability of course. yeah this games amazing. nough said.",3
"did not grab me. the story seems totally worthless (you are the chosen one!!!!!!, also, please break out of jail!), characters seem boring, and encumbrance is a terrible gameplay element in any game. obvious ui changes added by fan-made mods were totally missed by the developers when they made the game, perhaps for simplicitys sake. i play with a controller, so most of the skyui mods keyboard-friendly changes dont help me, but some of it is still far better than the base game. some of the cool mods require at least one piece of paid dlc, which brings the on-sale price of skyrim up to $13.59 (the cheapest way to get the game + dlc). thats more than it costs to buy any number of incredible games. $7.49 would be more appropriate. its amazing to me that skyrim still sells well at these rip-off prices, because i just dont see what makes it fun. one of the most vital mods, skyrim script extender, doesnt integrate well with the main game and needs to be launched from a separate file. proper mod support for an epic, sprawling game like this would have been nice. ill take a turn-based japanese rpg like paper mario, earthbound, or even pokemon over an action-focused western rpg like this or fallout 3. i also recommend rogue legacy if you want a game that has leveling up that is also actually fun to play.",1
"words cant describe this game, just buy it and see.",1
"recommend the game, best rpg experience, has a ton of gameplay, you never get bored, plus all that in around 10gb on your computer ( if u install hd pack )",1
"much awesome, always heaps to do, they need to make this lan or make a dedicate server mod as i dont like the elder scrolls online but i love this game. i still need to finish it actually now that i think of it...",1
"this game is the best way to lose whole chunks of your life! it has everything you could possibly want in an rpg. great character generation, one hell of a landscape to explore and the best fighting system in any game. it will run beautifully on quite modest pcs so you dont need an ubermachine to play it. all in all it is the best game bar none.",1
"i am a little reluctant to recommend this but i will - i just dunno yet, im not as impressed as i should have been. morrowind was revolutionary and oblivion captivating but this is so... so so. it is elderscrolls so its worth picking up when its on special under $10. the hud annoys me it is clumsy and easily frustrating with the whole thing having a heavy consol feel. imho dont pay the full price but still there are worse games out there with higher pricetags.",2
"the 2011 chapter of the series that invented the open world rpg... would you really expect any less than the best?",1
"an amazing even for 2015 standards. if you want a rpg action-roleplay game this is the one for you! 10/10",3
"hi game! lets win with dragons! like the khaleesi. i am mother of dragons.",1
"this game is one of the best games to play on pc as you can use the steam workshop or the skyrim nexus to add mods into your game to improve and change your game",1
"best open world, time killing, dungeon exproring game! spend hours of fun making your character! enjoy an amazing storyline! (provided you dont get sidetracked by nearly endless sidequests) horde items you will never use! choose a follower to help you clear dungeons! (who will most likey just get in your way) then download amazing mods to double the sidequests, useless items, and additional storylines! or just download so many mods its not even the same game anymore! the possibilities are endless! cons of this game: having lydia as a follower.",1
"this game is a masterpiece, although i think they have taken many ideas from one of my favourite games, the elder scrolls iv: oblivion. although skyrim is an amazing game, i wish they could have come up with some original ideas and not copy bethesda game studios.  i pin one babys foot to the floor and watch it go around in circles ouch tooo much? honestly im just hungry as balls and i wanna go eat ramen out of the grand tea masters  lol  btw you guys better send me great sacrifices. i know you will you because yall are nasty. my roommate spilled sriracha sauce all over his bed and the walls and he sleeps in a pile of dried up hot sauce mixed with his urine and stuff so you can imagine what it smells like in there - alduin",1
"the most addictive & rewarding game i have played in a long time. it looks spectacular. i even spent days just wandering around looking at the scenery, discovering more and more as i went along. the main story arc offers months and months of gameplay especially when added to the numerous other storylines, be it the thieves guild, the dark brotherhood, the college at winterhold, the companions, the empire vs the stormcloaks war and more. how you to respond to the in-game characters dictates how they respond to you and allows you to access a multitude of side quests which keep you occupied as you continue on your epic journey. choose how you want to play... are you a warrior relying on your skills with weaponary of do you rely on magic to vanquish your foes? choose your follower, even get married and raise a family!! oh... and slay a few dragons on the way!! dont be fooled by the mere 42 hours i have played on steam... i have over 1000 hours of gameplay on the ps3 version. a game so good... i bought it again on pc. such a shame i dont own an xbox!! otherwise i would have completed the trifecta!!! highly recommended!!",1
"great game and well worth the money. looks awesome in 3d vision with the helix fix..",1
"es 5 has given me more than i could imagine. the world is so extensive and there is so much to be done. the mod community has also given so much to make the game unique for everyone that plays it.",1
"you will spend a stupid amount of time on this game if youre a completionist like this guy",1
">2013 >not owning skyrim already >not knowing of its great adventure and gameplay >10/10 >mods",1
"hands down, the greatest game ever made! another knockout game by bethesda!",1
"skyrim isnt a game. skyrim is a way of life. if you purchase skyrim, expect not to see your familly or friends for a very long time. you will laugh as you rain distruction on inocent villagers, cry when you defeat your first dragon, and you will pose in triumph after completing one of the guild questlines. to put it simply, skyrim is a game worth buying. just dont buy it wtih the expectation of stopping anytime soon.",2
"if you want an awesome open world rpg, get this game!",1
"love this game hoping the dlcs will be on sale soon",1
"i have lost over 500 hours to this game. need i say more?",3
"realy cool game , if you like rpgs you should realy try skyrim",1
"utterly massive in every way. skyrim is both a work of art and an experience youll never forget.",2
"this was a very fun game. you can explore the world and after you complete the quests you can still walk around and do what you want. i would recomend the game to anyone who likes to do what they want. this game, you can play how you want, when you want, what you want. there are many classes to choose from. you can explore the world how you like, kill things, and do quests for evil. overall a very good game.",1
"one of the best rpgs out there, one of its kind. :) you are what you play -love this freedom of choice thing. strongly recommended!!!",1
"this game is straight out of 2011, but still holds up well to nowadays standards when keeping it vanilla. youre given a bunch of locations to explore, a bunch of quests to complete, a ton of bandits and animals to behead, and factions. whether you want to be bladesman, professional robber, or hitman. all yours to choose. the game starts off with a heavily scripted event, where youre about to get killed, but freed due to a dragons raid.  that- everyone knows that beaten path already. anyway, vanilla is good from the quantity of things to do. only thing that was painful for me was the skill grindfest. now to the amazing part. you can chunk a ton of mods onto this game and itll look better than recent releases, depending on how much your rig can handle. 2k textures? all there. 8k dragons? all good. a ton of enb shaders? even better cinematics than the one console players defend. though, workshop is poorly done. better grab only a few mods off there. best methods are nexus mod manager and mod organizer. if youre new to making games awesome, take it slow, or you might flip a table because you installed your ton of mods in the wrong order. now, go play the beaten path everyone knows,  up the dawnguard, and kill the emperor with your cooking skills, and dont forget to get yourself a good enb.",2
"this game is very addicting and if you get bord after 40 hours of playing it theres always workshop",1
"this game is like crack. the mods are like heroin. after about 15 minutes of playing the game crashes, i overdose and die. every time.",1
"by far one of my favorite games of all time. i cant stop playing. the graphics are amazing, it doesnt require too beefy of a computer, and the world is full of life in its huge environment. dont feel like being a good guy? beat the living  out of the guards and blow away citizens with your fire magic. feel like doing good in the world? go ahead.",1
"its like far cry 3 but without the explosions, guns, cars, or physics!",1
"a ton of things to do, lots of mods, a great game in general.",1
"it has been a 2 year journey, i am now ready to take my place among those who have rated this title. skyrim can not be explained in mere words, it must be experienced for its beauty and unique saga. this game has many quests, stories, characters and even invisible dynamics. its excellence in a way reminds me of a great love, in the sense that this stunning vision also has its own flaws. do not misunderstand, skyrims flaws only add character and depth. in a world this vast there is always need for the angle of unknown. it cannot be better than oblivion or morrowwind, however those titles cannot surpase skyrim. its scenary will captivate and the many side storys and people you will engage have a life and story to (virtually) live through. armor sets are many and with great variety. i guess my favorite moments were when i would stand out at night.....just looking at the northern lights (aurora borealis). steam states that i am close to 145 hours, its much more than that trust me. in a nutshell if this game interests you even a little then play, a connection will be made nay even a bond that you will carry....forever.",1
"best game ive ever played. very good storyline, and very good mods. a must have!",5
"this is a no-brainer. it is one of the best games ever made. there are tons of mods available for every facet of the game. you can make this one of the best looking games ever, if your computer can handle it.",1
"a game with literally no end! even after almost 3 years people still play it like it came out yesterday. 10/10",1
"not sure what all the hype was about. from a long time rpg player this game is one of the slowest and least fun titles ive played. its really just eye candy, the world looks nice, and lighting and weather effects, but the monster and npc models are horrible. they look like graphic skins on a bag of potatoes. its just not an engaging game, theres too much travelling between quest locales or towns with literally nothing of interest. plus, youll stuff your pack with items of supposed value, to try to build up some wealth, only to find out its all worthless. waste of time, dont get suckered into the false hype.",1
"very good game to jack off to... graphics 8/10 mods 9/10 gameplay 8/10 story 5/10 - there isnt really a story download some nude mods~skyrim will be your main hoe",1
"what a great game: - beautiful graphics; - great story; - good gameplay; - epic soundtrack; if you played any of the past elder scrolls and it did didnt appeal to you i think you will enjoy this game even more! 10/10*",2
"dumped many many hours into this game, mostly dicking around. it was a good experience. vanilla is too vanilla, though.",2
"there is nothing to say about this game, its freaking awesome and you all know that",1
"i have always been a fan of the elder scrolls ever since morrowind back in 2002 and in my opinion this is a great sequel. skyrim is the most stunning game to look at in the elder scrolls seris however some graphical gltiches occur. skyrim has also the best modding community so far as after more than 3 years mod delvepors either in the nexus or the workshop are still cranking out great mods to help enchance the game. in the end you must play this game if you are looking for a great rpg experince or just a great game.",2
"yes, people have been giving this game so much hate. according to people the combat is slow. i disagree with that, the combat is smooth and fair. the side quest are amazeing, and main story line is also really good. graphics are really nice, runs really smooth. mods are also recommended, skyui makes your inventory alot better to use. i really recommend this game, its not like a omg best game ever or so, but its really worth your time to play and worth the price. i dont know much it is now but i got it off the thanksgiving sale for $7.50 :p",1
"id recommend this game for everyone who loves singleplayer rpgs, this is undoubtly the best one out there!",2
"probably one of the greatest games in the history of games. cannot wait to play online action.",1
"i love this game, though there are bugs. the bare vanilla game is okay, but its still awesome, but theres problems too. ( bugs, etc. ) also, the game is extremely fun with mods!",2
"great game, good graphics, very nice detail. epic storyline. great amount of quests to solve and complete in great detail. no bugs. another great thing you can do in the pc version that you cant in console is get mods, which is really entertaining and may enhance your experience a bit more whilst playing this game. 10/10",1
"i recently got a new pc so i ould play steam games with ease and this is the best game i have found yet, it is immersive, addicting, intricate, difficult, and most of all, fun! i have 67 hours on record nd ive only had it for two months. this game has taken away my l dont mind",1
"another great addition to the elderscrolls series.",1
"legendy edition (with all the dlc) is (overall) the best fantasy rpg of all time, and i _love_ fantasy rpgs. the dlc really adds a lot of high-quality content. best played when you have all of the content at the beginning and the whole world just melts together with the dlc and you dont really know what is coming from where.",1
"worth whatever price it is. a must buy for anyone who plays casually or obsessivley.",1
"what the hell are you doing reading these reviews? buy the game. now.",1
"this is a great game! im pretty pissed though that i bought it last night for 10$ and then now this morning it drops down to 5$ still a great game",1
"you can steal spoons in oblivion. you cant steal spoons in skyrim. why? because there are no spoons. 0/10 would fus roh dah again.",1
"will update review later. as of now, its excellent. its skyrim. :d",1
"the game took my life for around 400h...and then i bought the original anyway. that awesome.",1
"equal to vitural crack...no really. if you play this game you will become addicted. ...that is all.",1
"if i didnt have to eat or sleep to stay alive i would literally play this 24/7",1
"one of the best games i have ever played and am currently still playing",1
"awesome game, much replay ability, many fun things to do an overall a good game thats true to the series",1
"to me playing skyrim feels like masterbating. it feels great and i cant wait to do it again.",3
"this is one of the most boring games i have ever tried to play. i was spoiled by the mass effect franchise, i guess.",1
"im not a huge fan of major lables removing features they claim as under used. while i definately have a lot of hours invested in skyrim, the game feels a bit stripped, and as always the combat is a bit outdated. thief classes always seem to excel in these types of games where warrior and mages struggle. the death animations you see in trailers rarely happen. i prefer to play the game in first person for total immersion, and often times the kill animations drop back to third person, killing the whole idea of immersion. i have a beast of a machine, and i can safely say this game is not optimized for pc. there are a lot of low-resolution textures that are completely unaccepatble for a game released in 2011. im eagerly awaiting the expansions in hope that they will re-add some old features from oblivion and morrowind. all in all, a great game, but its quite apparent that bethesda was too focused on the big picture, leaving the modding community to polish the details.",1
"hundreds of hours of gameplay before even considering the expansions or mods. one of the greatest gaming bargains.",1
"skyrim is an all-around great game. i like how its open world and has multiple quests so you never get bored. its also cool how you can choose what race you are (for example, i am a redguard). skyrim has a lot of freedom involved, which is appealing to most people. i reccomend it to anyone.",1
"my favorite game of the year, and every year since ive had it. skyrim is the best open world game ive ever played. 10/10",1
"its skyrim! what the hell cant you love about it?!",1
"stop right there criminal scum, buy the game or serve your sentence, your wallet and money are now forfeit.",1
"its skyrim. /skyrim/. what do you expect other than skyrim, lol.",1
"i have invested so much time in this game- for those of you who dont already have it -get it",3
"you will get eaten by alduin if you dont play this game. end of story.",1
"very large, lots of exploration, the fun of treasure hunting...........i love it, no other game (other than fallout) has these same elements. recommended :), bacon approves.",1
"probably the best openworld rpg i have ever played and with one of the biggest open world maps.",1
"its a really good game i only have one problem with it. the input lag. but other than that it is a great game. send me a message if you know how to fix because none of the fixes on google have worked for me.",1
"this game is worth the buy i play it non stop pretty much!",1
"feels repititive and not as fascinating as its predecessor oblivion. but bethesda rarely produces bad games, so still not bad really.",1
"i dont need to say anything about skyrim or other elder scrolls games. they are not compared to other games. other games are compared to elder scrolls. skyrim doesnt deny its origins and is a faithfull part of tamriels conturbated story. skyrim is epic. that would be enough to say but lets say something else as well. it b brings life to the northern side of tamriel as never done before and puts you into the role of the dovahkiin, the dragonborn, a hero, as those sung by bards, born with blood of the dovah, the dragons, and sets you in an adventure that you wont see anywhere else. you will brave the lush fields, snowy pastures, crowded cities and ancient tombs and dungeons of skyrim, where a battle for control is in place while dragons from the past are coming back to life. you will battle thru the guts of dragons and draugr, vampires and werewolves, and help comrades, thieves, assassins, companions and so much more that cant be said and done in these few lines. you are dragonborn and all the secrets of the world await for you!",1
"tesv skyrim is the best open world rpg in gaming to date. the amount of freedom and openness is stunning, and the game is truly stunning if you have a graphics card capable of handling it. the mod community for this game is among the most active thorughout gaming, in spite of skyrims age. mods are constantly being released and updated, allowing for nearly endless replayability. the main storyline is very good, but the sheer amount of dungeons and side quest will almost always attract your attention. you will likely spend hours traversing the wilds while dungeon crawling and hunting for loot. v very few of the side quests feel like fetch quests. each side quest has a uniqeness and fun all on its own. in addition to the main story and side missions, there are several unique factions that demand your services, each with its own fully fleshed storyline, characters, and perks. in conclusion, the world, errr skyrim is your oyster filled to the brim with hundreds of hours of story, loot, and fun.",1
"i cant say enough about this game. between my wife and i, we have played over 300 hrs of this game. it will immerse you in a world full of adventure, fantasy and rich lore. there are a ton of mods for this game which allows you to customize the game how you want it if you are not happy with the vanilla version. you will definitley get your moneys worth out of this game with the length of the campaign along with side quests and replay value. if you are a fan of western rpgs or enjoyed any of the previous elder scrolls or fallout games, get this game now!",1
"one of my all time favourite games. really allows you to do whatever you want. the dlc really do add allot to the game.",2
"highly recommended fantasy rpg ive played morrowind, oblivion sor thousands of hours. now i cant find enough time to spend on skyrim! its a huge world for you to explore at your pace, meeting distinctive characters, battling all kinds of brigands and monsters. the crafting system is simple and intuitive, so you can craft yourself better weapons and armor as you progress if you invest some time in gathering the resources and honing your skills. there is no one single way to play the game or win battles. you are free. what road will you take next?",1
"this is hands down one of the best games i have ever played. the gameplay is incredible and you can sit at your computer for hours and play without ever getting bored. there is always something else to do, and even without the dlc i have played 43 hours and still am not even close to finishing everything this game has to offer. bottom line this game is extraordinary i would recommend it to anyone.",1
"i used to have a social life like you, until i took a skyrim to the knee",1
"if you dont already own this game, what can i say? its the greatest game, and after level 40 may get old, but thats why you make a new character, or wait, because this game always comes back up. and on pc, you can download mods from the workshop or the nexus!",1
"awesome game with fantastic graphics and a huge world to explore. love it<3",1
"too console, too casual. morrowind was way better in its time.",1
"one of best games in my library. fantastic rpg which will entertain you for many many hours. im really recommending to buy the dlcs too it will improve the game, as well as the time you will spent in the world of skyrim. although the game came out in 2011 it has still comparable graphic to game which came out now.",1
"168 hours and counting. ive been a big fan of the elder scrolls series since the first one, arena, back in the 90s. looks great, lots to do, and none of the goofy leveling mechanics of its predecess, oblivion. as will al of these big open world games by bethesda, there are a few glitches here and there but most pretty minor and/or can be dealt with via a variety of mods.",1
"epic fantasy reborn the next chapter in the highly anticipated elder scrolls saga arrives from the makers of the 2006 and 2008 games of the year, bethesda game studios. skyrim reimagines and revolutionizes the open-world fantasy epic, bringing to life a complete virtual world open for you to explore any way you choose.",1
"this game is one of the funnest rpgs ive ever played. 10/10",1
"the greatest open ended rpg of all time hands down. well worth rebuying this on pc even after 100 percenting it on 360. the graphics are so insanely better it doesnt even look like the same game. so much more detail. even things as pointless as catching butterflies or picking flowers for alchemy are better, because you can actually see them on the pc version.",1
"mod this game to buggery and have fun ;) amazing game either way.",1
"writing review? hmm, where to start? it is same with this game, awsome freedom. 10/10",1
"go to parthunax place, meet goat in the brigde goat run to small bridge entrace and stopped try to pass goat fall and die --------------------------- try to find shortcut in dungeon jump into water die 10/10",1
"an epic game that i just keep on coming back to. amazing modding community too, theres always some new mod to make the game look better.",1
"ive played the elder scrolls since morrowwind and this one is the best one yet! i am a khajit that is the leader of the dark brotherhood, a member of the circle in the companions, the arch-mage of the college of winterhold, part of the thieves guild, of course the dragonborn, and many other things. gameplay and graphics are amazing, and this game tells you how to play and then cuts you loose, you can do whatever the hell you want, no ones gonna tell you not to. kill dragons, pickpocket, murder, jump off a mountain, shout the jarl so he glitches into his chair (i do that alot :d), and whatever else! 10/10 would be a murdurer and a pickpocket again!",1
"best game ever. i love that you can mod it so much.",1
"any pc user should consider using mods. they convert what is a rough diamond into a flawless diamond. definitely elder scrolls v is a masterpiece, anyway.",2
"realy grate game but i still like oblivian beter cuz of map size but onther then that a realy good game.",1
"a really good game that has never ending quests to get you hooked on to the game. youll experience a whole different gaming experience in skyrim due to its outstanding graphics.",1
"skyrim is an rpg like no other. the amount of content is incredible, and with mods, infinite. the gameplay is smooth and immersive & if you havent played it yet, youre missing something great.",1
"i like any game when i can play as myself and not a big hairy barbarian,yay",1
"overrated. i had fun with it the first 70 hours or less, but the lack of challenge and contrast killed the game for me. its silly how easy you can get overpowered by legit ways, such as raising you smithing and enchanting to 100, which will result in most enemies dying in 1-4 hits. hell, even the dragons can be killed within seconds. this basic game might be fun for people who like to roam around in their own imaginable way, slaughtering masses with little to none effort, but id rather play a game that has a little challenge to offer for the mind.",1
"still one of teh best games i ever played, played alot on consol but now on pc, its soo great adn much better on pc with mods that make teh game look alot better",1
"i wanted to call it game of the year, what i like is that the game difficulty is not set too low and that the enivorment is very detailed, the sounds and the music are nice as well all together a impressive atmosphere. its very small, the download only has a size of 5,8gb. on the other hand, the graphics engine itself is looks very old, when you get closer to anything, all you see is edges, little texture bugs... reminds me on rage; same problem. the controls of the game are a disaster. seriously. the npc/ai players block your way , the enemy ai gets stuck at random objects. the mainquest is done very fast, (lvl 11 was enough to finish it) i think i took double the time for oblivion, at the end its just, travel - fight dragon - travel - fight dragon again. and again... uuuh so creative. the secondary quests are fun, also its fun to just ride arround with the horse and let it fall down from high mountains. its not worth the 49, wait for a special offer.",1
"not really sure what to say about this one; if you play it straight out of the metaphorical box, its a  game. however, if you mod the everloving balls of of it, it becomes a somewhat passable game. fortunately, doing so is really easy. in summation, dont play vanilla skyrim. if you do, youre doing it wrong.",1
"before playing skyrim make sure that you have a few hours spare because you will need them. once you start playing you cant stop!",1
"legendary edition worth the money. very fun for a decent price :)",1
"what i like about skyrim...what i like about skyrim...if i told you everything, wed be here for awhile. short version all i can say is that if you have yet to buy this game, then you have wasted your money on other games! the elder scolls v: skyrim is perhaps the best game ive ever laid eyes upon! the graphics, the gameplay, the characters, and the potential mods! the story plot could use some work, but reguardless, you will enjoy this game. ive made over 10+ characters playing this game alone and served 600+ hours on this game. i originally bought it for xbox 360, and again on the pc. if you get a little bored, youll always find yourself coming back. there is even a huge modding community dedicated to adding more content to the game for free! why are you still reading this, why arent you playing skyrim! im not just saying this points or anything, i specifically chose this game because everyone should have a copy, i can assure you, the money is well spent playing this game.",4
"who ever hates this needs to see a therapist. get the game!",1
"i nornally am not taken to the elder scrolls games but each one seems to be more and more enjoyable to me. the vast size of the play area can lead to some boring stretches but there is fast travel and horses to help you get were you need to go when you dont feel like walking all the way there. once again the darker side quest arc in the game turned out to be my favorite adn i never finished the main story line. still i found the niche i got into very enjoyable and i havent been able to find similar gameplay of this quality in another game.",1
"i originally had this game on my x box-360, but my friend bought me the pc version in the christmas sale, and i finally started playing it today and it us just amazing playing it on the pc due to all the mods you can put on this game! i`d give it a thumbs up or 5 out of 5 star rating!",1
"such a great game. its big, awesome and ... and i dont know the right words. for everyone who likes fantasy, rpgs and/or want to try something in that direction, this is musthave",3
"killing dragons with a ing sword and epic music. theres also dragons u can kill, with a ing sword.",1
"probably should have reviewed this before i hit 500 hours on this game. it is a great game, amazing graphics, and the occasional hilarious glitch. you are able to play the game any way you want to and all in all, it is just a lot of fun.",2
"hit a deer while on my horse, deer flew off into the distance. 11/10",1
"this game is one of the best ones. just so yallll know.",1
"if you havent played this, where have you been? fantastic game with incredible amounts of gameplay. be warned however, dont buy this for someone you like spending time with, because you wont see them for a month.",1
"got this because i wanted game similar to fallout and it is not as good for me as i like guns not magic i also like a good headshot. but without these biasis its a really good game especialy for someone more into that medival magic type games.",1
"a really good tes game, however it suffers from your typical bethesda flaws: you may have killed a couple of dragons, achieved great feats all ove, yet common people fail to recognize you in that regard so youre walking around like a nobody. it can be pretty frustrating... however theres still a huge world out there with lots of thing to do, the graphics/sounds are good and you have the steam workshop at your disposal, should you want to spice things up a bit. recommended especially for rpg players.",1
"oh my god, who doesnt think this game is a game of the year? sure it has its fair share of glitches but please name one, great, game that doesnt glitch and heck, half the time their quite funny. its an amazing single-player experience youll only get once every few years. i started playing it once and could never stop, its so fun. over 800 hours in this game i can tell you that this game is a must buy if you dont have it. the only things that could be improved on this is perhaps a co-op mode because who else thinks exploring tamrial with a friend is awesome? this game is so immense, chocked full of wonderful content. this is a must buy, 10/10",5
"your adventures will begin here. in the land of skyrim. for you are the last of the ..dragonborn!",1
"played through on 360, beat regular skyrim. playthrough 2 on ps3, dabbled in legendary, long way to go before complete. got legendary on pc, testing the limits of modding and console commands is really making this more exciting than the last 2 play-throughs. especially finding the room that has 1 of everything that you can console command coc to, ive done all these fn quests before, its great to be able to just go grab all the games keys and super special items so you can just enjoy your play-through without trivial bs. also, thomas the truck.  yeah. oh, one more thing, it looked good on 360. it looked great on ps3. it loads a billion times faster and plays way smoother on pc. got my ps3 controller wirelessly hooked up with motionjoy and this is the best skyrim experience ive ever had.",1
"so much to explore and find. beautiful game when modded. dragons are awesome.",2
"this game may just be one of the greatest things of all time, especially the writing was stellar. mods ruin it, dont get them.",1
"amazing game 2nd favourite game of all time (cant beat fallout!) this is amazing anyone who posts a bad review has no soul/imagination or just is really ing dumb amazing 101/100 must have if u have a good pc also modding is great!",1
"honestly one of the best games in this generation. it has been the one game to hold my attention for almost 3 years now. i originally bought it for xbox and again now for pc. i would rate it very highly due to its stunning graphics, dynamic quests and captivating story. it lacks simple get this item quests and replaces them interesting dungeons that each have their own story which if you take the time can be fascinating. followers and npcs seem more intellegent than other games and the dlcs add depth and a whole new story. if you play this game, expect hours of exploration and very quality narrative.",1
"you sit down, in the evening, launch the game, have awesome time playing and discover that it is 4 am and think to yourself - well... that was quite epic. in other words: its a great game!",3
"best rpg ive ever played in my life, if you loved oblivion, and morrowwind, youd adore skyrim.",1
"omg an elder scrolls game for less the 4 pounds buy it it will be the best 4 pounds you ever spent personal its the best perchase i ever made i bought it 2 years ago and it is still my best game i own or that is even realeased , first let me say after all that other stuff i said no its not a shooter its just a real game with depth that saved me from fps games i strongly recomend you buy it",2
"high emersive and a very well developed game with an amazing lore behind it highly recommended",1
"youll never find a more player-driven, open-world sandbox on the market than a bgs game. i have been a fan of bgs and tes since morrowind in 2002 and skyrim is no different. this game, especially on pc, is more than worth the $60 price tag. did i forget to mention tes also has the largest and most dedicated community in the gaming industry? unlimited and free player-made content makes the game never get old.",2
"this game is pure sex ! i fell in love with it the first time i played it 2 years ago. the coolest thing is that you can add mods if you are bored of the base game and youve been playing it for houndreds of hours. but the game is perfect the way it is : it has great graphics long campaign and intriguing storyline also addictive gameplay",1
"one of the greatest games i have ever played. i put a lot of time into playing this game with many different characters to play many different ways. loved every hour of it!",3
"in my vast collection of rpgs, skyrim rates as the most polished and engrossing adventure i have played. the replay ability is amazing when you add in the free mods found in the steam workshop. although i play it on a high end pc, i also play it via a vm on my imac and even with the graphics turned down it looks lovely and performs well. well worth the money and a good investment for the long term.",1
"this here is a game with an insane amount of content, which only gets doubled by all the work that gets added on skyrims workshop, and the skyrim nexus, 10/10 for everything from gameplay, combat and activities to content, awesome landscapes and modded content.",1
"the first time i put an arrow through a dragons eye midflight, and it ground to a halt in front of me, tearing up the earth, i was hooked. soundtrack is pretty boss, also.",2
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played. its also in the steam top 10 most played games ! if you dont own a skyrim, get it now ! you wont regret your money. the game itself is an adventure, the main story line is so long + a lot of amazing side quests and dlcs. once you will finish the game you can download tons of mods for more quests/monsters/armors/weapons... 10/10",1
"one day i started a brawl near the caravan and all the catfolk went nuts and killed a horse and a guard, and my brawl buddy bailed into the woods never to return.",1
"i have always been a fan of the elder scrolls, and this game to me was just another amazing advancement in the ongoing struggle in tamriel. there is too much to go on about, but if your into rpgs and you dont need the feel of mmo, then i highly recommend skyrim, and all the installments from the series.",2
"seriously, one of the best games ive ever played. the open world is so large that you feel like youll never discover everything. the gameplay is so enjoyable and frankly, addictive. the modding community is strong as well, and there are some pretty awesome mods for this game as well.",1
"this game is mod friendly and has a good story line. i recommend you get this amazing game.",1
"-be me jarl of whiterun -naked man walks in -devours 25 cheese rolls infront of me -guard walks up to him -says the arrow to the knee line -naked man stand behind him -disappears -guard is now naked -naked man becomes guard -comes to me and says somthing about dragons - pants -sent him to dangerous dungon -feel relieved -comes back with stone - intensifies -send him to kill dragon -by talos i hope he dies -comes back with dragon bones - you talos -send him to high hrothgar -hopefully thats the last time i see him -1 month later -comes back with stormcloaks to take over -me.jpg",1
"got in steam summer sale, dont regret buying it at all :d",1
"one of the few (if not the only) games where i think it was worth its original $60 price tag. the modding community makes it worth even more. great game. im sure you have heard of it. just dont but the dlc unless you have played over 50 hours of this game, because it would be hard to know if you even need more than is already given. plus the dlc are never on sale. hundreds of hours of entertainment guarenteed by this game, and then add on top the mods. good stuff. its like the feeling of discovery that fallout 3 and new vegas had (around every corner is something good to find that was different than the last corner) combined with the uniqueness of morrowind. basically it took the emphasis on graphics from oblivion (which although was amazing for its time is rather bland today even compared to morrowind a game much older than it.) and the creativity from morrowind. only complaint is the weather system ( i like to see everything around me), but that is easily turned off with an .ini command. im 90% that anybody already considering buying this will be blown away by the quality and replayability of this game. plus 3-5 years from now all the big major overhaul projects for the game should be coming out. and those are free (look up nehrim for obilvion, far better than obilvion, it was like skyrim before skyrim came out [minus the dragons])",1
"this is a great game and i would highly recomend it has tons of content and an amazing soundtrack and then with mods it makes this game over the top fun and lasting.",1
"what a game ladies and gentlemen.this game is absolutely awesome.i wanted to try it and i was amazed by its gameplay.it deserves more than a try and i soooooo recommend you to buy it.94/100 nough said.",1
"whether youre slashing a dragons wings, raising the dead back to life, or experimenting at the alchemy table, skyrim performs the most spectacular of enchantments: the one that causes huge chunks of time to vanish before you know it.you will have to spend dozens of hours to fully explore skyrim. like any other bethesda game, it has its share of imperfections and broken promises, but its exciting and fascinating nevertheless.",2
"this game is excellent! 10/10 but i will say one thing, its no dugeon dice monsters!",1
"every sale you buy new games, yet every time i keep returning to this amazing game :)",1
"ok, first let me say that i generally dont play alot of rpgs and absolutley hate anything involving knights, wizards, magic, castles and dragons. my birthday in november coincided with the games launch and someone gave it to me and it sat on my shelf for a couple of months before i even tried it . (the hype was pissing me off and i just had to see for myself) this is the best open world rpg/sandbox game ever made! (and im considering it for one of my most favorite games of all time) it is simply the most immersive game i have ever played . i had 70 hours in before i even strted the main storyline, which was a clear indicator to me from the start that the game lets you advance in anyway you want and advance your character in any style you choose. has the best levelling system and never felt like a grind at any point.the combat is fluid , the inventory and menu screens were simplistic, the world is huge with a rich totally interactive enviroment, and the graphics were breathtaking",1
"ive only really just started this game, its addicting as .",2
"immersive game that you can spend hundreds of hours playing and still have more to do",1
"a very adventurous and free choice game. -craftlikescake 2014",1
"skyrim is insane, its still playanle even 3 years after its release, its a must have game, dlc-hearthfire i honestky thought this would be horibble, but then i got it on sale and it actually adds a good bit more to the game, something to do. if you play skyrim for simulation, then you should get this. make a house, get hitched, adopt some kids and make them do chores, what better than that? probably a 8/10 dlc-dawnguard awesome. the dawnguard dlc is incredible, it adds planty of content and a great story line which can go one of 2 ways, be a vampire kill all vampires. both sides are awesome fun. dlc 10/10",1
"one of the funnest games ive ever played, after a while it can get old, but the modding system is great, when you play skyrim, you play it like an adict for a week, then you break for a month, but it always come itching back to you",2
"est dragon et mon chat! however i do like me some good ol fashioned racisted nords!",1
"i am pretty late, but i have so many friends who are not playing it. just let me say this: the fact that skyrim is my most played single player game (xfire) kinda speaks for itself.",4
"played skyrim instead of getting laid. 10/10 would do again.",1
"skyrim is one of the best adventure/free roaming games available to the public. it deserves its metascore of 94 and the only real problem with skyrim is its glitchness and bad bear motion.",1
"omfg its a dragon! 360 no scope bow and arrow to the face!",1
"now having over 200 hrs put in to tesv (and also some 200+ on console) i can almost say this is the best rpg even in 2015 , the game had alot of content that bethesda added but the modding society going strong for almost 3yrs you can keep playing the game and have a new adventure everyday. bethesda added alot of content themselfs (somethings they forgot) but the modding society makes the game more fun everyday , the gameplay is good for the beginning rpg player or the hardcore rpg player , you have so much variety of playstyles the choice is all yours. if i rate this game 1010 sweetrolls ill give it a : 11/10 sweetrolls",1
"decent yet is more stream lined and casualized than oblivion or past elder scrolls games. as an rpg is pretty awful as with even one play through you are pretty much gonna touch on everything that is worth touching on in the game world. genereally most people all play it the same way as the design is quite poor. its taken the negative features of past elder scrolls and kept them in while removing, many of the best features and charging for dlc that should have been in the game. the world revolves around you unfortunately unlike mount and blade where the world lives and you interact with it. in skyrim your the messiah, allah, jesus, and obama put into one body and called dovahkin. skyrim has very little depth even with such a large world which is strange. i suggest playing oblivion at the very least before skyrim. skyrim pretty much sucks, yes it can be fun but a 10/10 it is not. its over hyped and over flattered likely thanks to its simplification and casualization to attract people who would not play rpg games and prefer simpler run and gun games. you never have to think more than how to get to the next waypoint and nothing is really that interesting. the quests dont stand out and most are just derivatives of fetch quests. elder scrolls online is looking to be the final nail in the elder scrolls coffin.",1
"i love this game... i can easily get lost for hours doing the most trival thing such as organize supplies and attempting to decorate my home. i purchased this game when it was on sale over the summer and there is sat until recently i decided to play and i am truly impressed. i was once a very avid gamer, going back to the intellivision ;)... i always loved rpg and of course had played the first elder scrolls and loved it. i grew up when off to college and didnt game for over a decade... now i am back and have to say, at first i really didnt like this game, i mean i didnt specify my class... so much i was expecting was now gone, but in a good way... i could finally be a mage with skills of stealth and bow and arrow that would make the greatest thief blush. i played out my story the way i liked... i loved the city markarth and would focus on all the quests around that town. yeah there are some weird bugs and quirks, but overall the environment is so engrossing, you can easily spend hours on the game and not even realize it... the one thing that does somewhat bother me is the fact that its the same guy that does the voices for many of the male npcs and it can get annoying fast that they all have this same voice.",2
"garrys mod: bethesda edition yesidoacknowledgethatimadethesamereviewforgmod",1
"skyrim is an open world action/adventure game. you can climb the tallest mountains (to a certain point then you cant go any further up), swim across massive lakes, fight dragons, explore dungeons, kill anyone(some poeple just faint then get back up). basically you are free to do whatever you want, but what you choose to do affects what will happen. can you forge armor? make weapons?? you bet you can! personally i think it is one of the best games ive ever played! i highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!",1
"this game is the game that never ends. the quests are endless and the world ever exciting. 10/10",1
"dis gayme sux. obviously it was trying to beet black ops but it just cant. it aint even up 2 bf3 standardz",3
"while the base game is fun it can be riddled with bugs and dry at times, however it proves to be a fun game after intensive modding. with such a open and expansive modding community it makes you forget about all the cracks this games armor",2
"its skyrim. what more do i have to say? coming from a gamer that has never touched another tes game, i probably missed out on a lot of amazing gameplay. this game is by far my favorite game of all time. theres an nearly endless amount of quests you can do, areas to explore, and enemies to kill. i have played through this game multiple times but theres just so much more out there to do aside from what i have already done. i watch others play and i see new places i havent explored before. everything about the game is great (minus the minor bugs but no one even caares because the game is so good).",1
"this has some entertainment value but overall this game is lacking direction. its open world exploration is uninspired at best and brutally boring at worst. what story? where? if you want dark fantasy at its best go play the witcher and the witcher 2 where combat is skill based and story is exceptional. if you want hours of xp grinds and repetitive dungeons with no meaningful central story to keep your interest then this is the game for you.",1
"i killed a dragon, fell of a mountain, a thief tried to rob me when i was wearing daedric armor, a mudcrab pinched my balls... best...game...ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"very fun with addons and is just fun in general! i say you should get this!",1
"well, everybody like skyrim, everybody enjoy skyrim. obviously, me too, although after mounted level (very quickly, while maximum difficulty, thats a bit annoying), we can feel a certain weariness. but this game is the game of the elder scrolls saga. oblivion remain second in my opinion, even if without him we would not have skyrim. it is also important to note that after completing the game, a feeling of repetition can be felt in the exploration, but i think im influenced. after all, i redid this game a dozen times.",1
"played this game till i took an arrow to the knee.",1
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",1
"best game ever 5m/10.... soo much to do! if you run out of things.... modz. nuff said",1
"if you want a game with  girls and big boobs, this is the game for you",1
"awesome game, extremely replayable, supports tons of different play style, one of the best.",2
"i guess i like playing this game, i enjoy how the cows look real woolen, almost like a wooly cow, or a wooly rhino. plus there are lots of goats in this game, but i dont think there are any sheep, which doesnt make sense... where would the cows get the wool from in the first place? its the small questions like that one which make the game for me. i mean what other game out there right now has woolen cows in it? i cant think of a single one, not even farming simulator 2012 has cows made of wool in it so why does that game even get so much credit in the first place? i dont get it. if a game doesnt have woolen sheep and does have woolen cows, then tell me where the cows get the in wool from, all these unanswered questions are what make this game so great, and better than its competitors such as checkers or big 2.",1
"so it pretty much sucks your life away, but in a good way.",1
"i highly recommend this game to everyone. pay no attention to people that say this game is bad it isnt they are jut being trolls and dont know what a good game looks like. in skyrim you will notice the entremely high attention to detail. now while there are a few bugs, glitches, and issues with the game i have not noticed many at all in my 200+ hours on pc and my 400+ hours on xbox360. the game has a ton of quests that are very rewarding of your time (most of the time). theres never anything not to do in skyrim wheather it be exploring, doing quests for npcs, killing bandits, hunting ect... you will never have a dull moment in this amazing game for only $30 buy it and experience the exceletly crafted game of the elder scrolls: skyrim 10/10!",2
"one of the best games ive ever played by far. i will reccomend it to everyong i know :d.",1
"very expansive game with unending mods really keeps you playing it.",1
"far along in the game, im on a random bounty hunting mission to kill a random bandit chief. by this point, i have maxed out my stealth skill. so i quietly take out the bandit underlings inside the castle they use as their headquarters. floor by floor, room by room i am sniping them with arrows or shiving them in the back with a dagger. i feel like im tier one black ops. no one knows i am there until after they are dead. shhhhh, nighty-night. finally, i creep up to the top turret of the castle and i see my bounty standing there at the ramparts...with his back to me. he looks built to brawl, with his ebony armor. but he has not noticed me yet, as he stands there admiring the gorgeous view from the top... since i am coming up the stairs, i am eye-level with his feet. so i look up just a bit and hit fus ro dah. the angle i chose launched the bandit chief clear over the ramparts. he had enough hang-time for me to come out of hiding and watch him plummet screaming to the ground way down below and die on impact. that was when i decided to marry this game.",2
"imo still the best single player game, if you get bored you can just download mods for it. brilliant 5/5",3
"ive said this amidst all the hype when it was initially released and ill say it now; its not as good as oblivion. its still great, i love it. the addition of wyverns fills the void of lacking variety in the environment. ive not played the dlc but it allegedly adds a lot. i recommend it.",1
"im totally addicted to this game. i havent found a single-player game that i enjoyed this much in years! ive put in about 100 horus at this point (okay, maybe a bit more...) but i dont see myself stopping anytime soon. you can put as much into this game as you want, and although there are a few bugs here and there, it really is worth the time and money. its a different story for everyone, and i love that im still finding new things within the game.",2
"to date, this is still the most enjoyable and diverse game i have played, i have played around 10 different characters, 10 different ways of approaching quests (started in different cities), leveled different skills, and every character was a new experience, apart from the fact that you do the same quests, sometimes the order in which you do them, open up new quests, or you can do the actual quest itself differently which results in the outcome being different.",2
"one of the best games ever made. if you have not played it, play it.",2
"skyrim is the 5th installment in the elder scrolls series. ive played it on console and it is smooth and has very few bugs. the pc version is basically an expansion pack; you can download mods and have hilarious battle with a my little ponie avatar against thomas the tank engine! buy this game!!!!",1
"this game never gets old. even without dlc or mods, youll reach a good amount of hours on this (my steam account says i played it for 31 hours, but that is only true on pc. i had this game previously on xbox and ive played it since the year it came out). the game is so beautiful and immersive.",1
"cant even describe how good skyrim is. im sure youll all played it though and if you havent get to it!",1
"very good game, still relavant today, two years later and probably more to come!",2
"the best rpg ever made. the storys not amazing, but the gameplay and the vast open world is worth exploring (and its fun to do so). skill trees are intuitive, dialogue is quick, and the quests are plentiful. i have played it for over 1,000 hours. truly glorious.",2
"on pc its no doubt better then consoles!! i have played/owned skyrim on every playable platform and i always come back to pc, the reason is mods mods mods! mods make the game so much more playable its rediculous. 10/10 for pc and worth the buy if you meet the pc requirements",1
"this game is terrible. wouldnt play it for more than 10 minutes. 0/10",1
"skyrim is one of the best elder scrolls game i have ever played it is the best game ever. you must buy it now if u dont have it allready so yeah go buy it now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",1
"i recommend this epic game ( if you can call it that ) to all of my steam friends",1
"i have played this game for almost 140 hours and have still not discovered half of the game. 10/10",1
"not the best elder scrolls, but still a great game (i havnt put much time on the pc version, but i have beat the 360 one) 8.5/10 +great side quests +more than 3 voice actors! (*cough* oblivion *cough*) +well written (as usual) +great enviroments/textures +amazing modding community (so many nude mods!) +dragons are always awesome -some rough character models (especially giants) -disapointing main questline -still some balancing issues (again, the stealth option does not work!) -very glitchy (still)",1
"i think i messed up the story line,i killed everybody in whiterun,riverwood,morthal, and dawnstar",1
"look at the metascore..nuff said. get it and stop making excuses.",1
"lots of fun. one thing i suggest to everyone who plays or wants to play is to turn off the music and let the sounds of skyrim draw you in. makes a huge difference in game play. also, there are some awesome mods for the game that really enhance gameplay as well as adds features that players wished would have been added. totally worth every minute!",1
"in the land of skyrim, no one can hear your dragon shout. this is just one of those games where you spent more time tinkering with mods and struggling to get the game working than actually playing it. just like customizing your own car!",3
"awesome game! just became one of my favorites. theres so much stuff to do in there. side quests are awesome as much as main ones, definitely worth your time! 9.5/10",1
"refusing to stop, the elder scrolls franchises newest entry, skyrim, goes down kicking till the very end. admist civil war, the eater of worlds, or a bad- dragon decides to come back to add to the turmoil, and why not? it would seem that the time is ripe for dragons to come and gourge on the souls of our world. however, as luck would have it, there is (as in all fantasies) one person who can stand in the dragons way. watch out keanu reeves because a new chosen one is in town, get ready to hack, slash, burn, freeze, stun, scare, eat, stab, punch, shoot, throw, shout, claw, jump, and fling your way to victory past racist guards, foolish bards, crappy elves, drunken nords, or legendary monsters of epic proportions. hoprfully you do not have a girlfriend or 8-5 job, because if you do, you will not have the time to one-hundred percent this game. i mean, have you seen the hit short film dragonbored? some amount of stars that amounts to 5.",1
"skyrim has one of the best graphics of the games fron 2011 in my opinion. this game is not like the most games. you dont have to follow the mainstory, you can do other quests if you want, you can make yourself stronger. its up to you what you do with your character. i really like that. its refreshing. there is so much to do in this game, many choices. you can become the great hero, a very skilled thief, an assassin, you can become the greatest warrior and you can even marry someone. i would recommend this, just because of the nice landscape and the stories.",2
"about a zillion reviews out there, so wont hit too much detail; suffice to say, its still a game i go back to, bugs and all, and keep finding new stuff to do after all the time ive put into it. it may not be the best game of all time, but it love you long time.",1
"most personalllised game i have ever played! big two thumbs up!!!!",3
"great rpg experience. seems like plenty of stuff to do, (50 hours in, not even close to finishing). i would recomend this game to anyone with a taste for rpgs.",1
"i liked everything in the game. play was well ballanced for advancement. would of liked to see more points for skills (with dual combonation play {magic/fighter, thief/forester} to be let the charector grow with advancement. highly recommend. play oblivion also.",4
"there is no game i would reccommend more highly on pc than this. this game has such huge modding potential, that it just trumps any other game that ive ever encountered. pros: huge, immersive game world easily understood rpg leveling system great potential for role playing, playing normally, or just plain messing about. cons: tha game does have a few minor shortfalls, such as some rather stiff or uninteresting npcs or an illogical guild system, but all of these problems have fixes available on the steam workshop. just get this game, now. then, go into the steam workshop and install inigo. enjoy!",1
"i remember in oblivion there was fully rendered horse butt-hole. this game has a distinct lack of horse butt-hole. 2/10",1
"best. game. ever! (legendary edition on xbox 360 with 100% achievements)",1
"i killed a chicken and the whole town went after me 11/10 would play again",1
"dont play it. especially not with mods. it will ruin you",1
"its simply the best open-world role playing game ive ever played, and its 2011s game of the year. you need to spend hours and hours to fully explore skyrim. this game is beautiful, amazing, and brilliant. i have nothing to say more. just get the game, it worths it! 10/10",1
"no other singleplayer could steal so much of my life than this game. it is absolute outstanding. some may say that it is kinda old engined and just a rip off from oblivion / fallout. but that may stand for the base game. what every tes really makes the game the players want is the mod support. with mod you make of skyrim an entire different game with textures where even crysis may be jealous. now buy the legendary edition while it ins on sale and i promise you that you will not regret it.",2
"skyrim, it seems, is a game that people buy expecting it to be the best or the worst game ever. when they plunge in, most people think its very good, with its beautiful world, a story thats pretty good (in my opinion), and nice atmospheric music. after you plug in several buttloads of hours, though, it starts to lose its appeal, and gets repetitive. the game mechanics are all very nice, although the combat usually ends up just mindlessly hacking/spurting magic at your enemies. playing as a sneaky thief, however, might help make it more interesting, with bows and whatnot. the story might seem kind of ehhh, but really, i just like the lore. all things considered, skyrim is definitely a worthwhile game.",1
"as good as you think it is: get those mods, its the best thing you could do for your skyrim game!",1
"honestly one of the best open world actionrpgs of the past couple of years.",1
"this has to be one of my favorite all time games. i like that fact that you can go anywhere you want, do anything you want, at anytime. if i get bored with that, i can follow the quest line or pick up various quest by talking to folks in town. and if i want i can just sit at the bar and drink all day. the graphics are very good and the game mechanics are very good as well. i recommend you get this game. ive logged close to 500 hours (as have most of my friends) it just never gets boring.",3
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a massive, gorgeous singeplayer game that was born with replayability, only to have its legendary status be increased by the addition of thousands of easily accessible mods.",1
"its skyrim.....i dont need to review this.....10 out of mods and portal was a mod for half life before it was a game and a triangle has 3 sides half life 3 confirmed",1
"ive played over 50 differnet ways since it came out and still playing it to this day....i freaking love it, whens elder scrolls 6 coming",1
"great story and deep exploration, an amazingly detailed world. it is a place you will remember for your entire life.",1
"im not the type to rate games like this. im a fan of pokemon and nintendo. yeah, im that guy lol. but when i was introduced to this game through a friend, i realized there was a whole new world of gaming that i have missed. i watched him play this game for hours, getting totally into the story, the characters, the action... it was mind-blowing. now that i have played this game for myself, i see why so many people get lost in it. the mods are what keep me coming back. i love being able to add new weapons and armour and even missions. its what keeps me coming back to this game after a year of owning it. if there are any gamers out there who havent given this a try, you should. it replace any mario or pokemon game you play, at least for awhile. ;p",1
"i killed a dog and got murdered by a whole town 10/10 would kill dog again",1
"awesome game. as usual, bethesda delivers a great game.",1
"started modding and forgot to finish the game. s ftw!",1
"ye iss good, u ardy heard abot it so i dont need tah tell u agin, is super fun and massive gem. if iss like on sale fer like $15 dollards den jus get it cos iss worth it m8",1
"another great elder scrolls game. a fantastic open world sandbox, but is pretty rough as-is. this game is fantastic with the right mods and shouldnt be missed.",1
"this game is amazing. much detail. much fun. much of life wasted. much content in dlc.",1
"a awesome epic game that cannot be missed , it captures your time like no other game can and keeps u coming back for more , its great escapeisum at its best and the mods u can get for the game are outstanding , its a difinate must for any rpg fan",4
"love this game.... have inveted so much time but it is the ultimate in free roam... when will there be vi",1
"i am slowly coming to resent this game, not because it is bad, but simply because it is addictive. i have alienated my loved ones, my cat has died due to starvation, and i currently live on unemployment due to the fact that i was generally unproductive in my former occupation; all because of skyrim. so that is why, dear reader, i have taken 15 minutes out of my life not to obsessively play skyrim, but instead to warn you of how treacherously addictive this game is. therefore, if you cherish food, success, and human contact, i would recommend that you dont purchase this game. p.s. although this review embodies many aspects of my sad, sad, life, it is still nonetheless a joke review.",2
"as always bethesda made a work of art. lots of freedom, amazing art, sound, music, good storytelling, good mechanics, and a huge modding community. the only thing i personally dont like its the user interface, its very crappy, made for gamepads (even that i dont know if its good enouth...). the last ui that i liked from bethesda it was the one in elder scrolls 3: morrowind. the good news are that you can easily change it with a community mod. after taking all into consideration, this game is very good, and i recommend it :)",2
"granted after playing all day for many days and after seeing all their is for a quite a few playthroughs it does start to get a little boring, but it takes a lot of playthroughs to do so. over all i have played this both on the xbox360 and on my laptop and i find the pc version of skyrim to run far better than the console versions. some may complain about how dreary it seems, but think about the land, the in game culture, and the social situations in the game. of course its more dreary. if you are into first person rpgs this is a game you should at least consider. many do not regret it.",4
"well, this is one oft he best games i have ever played. moving between third and first person views is nice. story is nice. graphics are wonderful! and the game itself is really hard sometimes. beats triple-a titles of 2014 easily.",1
"great game! there is so much to do and mods make it even more fun 10/10!",1
"wow, so ing addictive. endless quests, sleepless nights!",1
"one of the best games you can get! its so fun with many different quests and activities. you can join groups like the guild, brotherhood and more! and if you get bored theres so many workshop items you can get to enhance the fun! also great dlc.",1
"now, lets be honest, this game is really really really really fun! get a controller or just the keyboard and mouse load up and make your character, and rp (roleplay) if you like dishonored, oblivion, or and kind of rp game out there this is the one for you! play your way, vampire or werewolf, invasion or defend, craft or buy, most of all shout at people! so yes i recommend this game!",1
"100% recommended for anybody looking for a purely amazing rpg game",3
"good fun game except for some bugs and glitches of the game though, but its still all good though 8.9/10",1
"the graphics, amazing. even for it being a 2011 game. it you like long storylines,gaming,fun, ect. then you gotta buy skyrim. its on sale but i bought it back 2011. totally worth it.",1
"pretty much more than youll need for a very worthwhile rpg. wonderful open world. of course, this is working off of oblivions engine so the characters are samey and the animations are wonky. plus there are random crashes, but thats just pcs disadvantage compared to consoles. wutisconsolewar",1
"note: this is a review on vanilla skyrim, i dont care if there are thousands of mods im reviewing the game as it is unmodded. pros: faces are a massive improvment from oblivion mountains and ruins look thousands of times better than oblivion, especially the mountains. music when fighting dragons is epic. the music overall is better than oblivions dragon fights are epicness archery is much more improved, its alot faster. pretty good storyline cons: coloring sucks balls. the grey atmosphere looks great on mountains but awful on lush forested places. melee combat system is more like press x to not die which you are basicly just spamming attacks with no strategy. npcs suck , theyre all the same, they all say the same thing to your character about the war. they never evolve to your character. they will treat a level 1 fur armored player the same way they would treat a level 50 dragon slayer savior of sovngarde player, except for a few comments guards will make about you but other than that they will all treat you the same all the time. i find the dungeons extremley repetitive and boring. each dungeon basicly looks the same as the last one except duplicated to look bigger. final verdict: 7/10, would recommend for 29 dollars but im nearly on the verge of not recommending it because the cons i listed really ruin the game.",1
"watched free porn. got a virus. bought skyrim for the nudity mod. didnt get a virus. 11/10, would fap again.",1
"one of the best games i have ever bought, highly recommend this. action packed rpg with a bunch of content, wont regret buying this even if youre not a rpg enthusiast. cant get enough of this game at all. look! there are even mods that can enhance your experience. steam workshop is truly amazing since its quick and easy to use! constantly being updated too!",1
"i have an ongoing problem with this game... i cant have all of the fun at once =[ highly recommended.",1
"a amazing game where you are totaly free to kill monsters, do quests, make armor, and lots of more! you have a lot of levels to reach and unlock new skills, earn more health stamma or magic. the character which is dragonborn is a amazing thing. he can learn shouts which does really good damage on monster or animals. the dlcs dragonborn, heartfire and dawnguard is the best experianse of the skyrim gameplay. dragonborn where you can tame dragons and ride them. hearthfire where you can make a house and lot of more. dawnguard where you can become a vampire do a lot of more quest and have lots of fun. it can be difficult but thats just in the start. once you have reached more levels the game will be the best thing in your life. you cant stop playing this game. i recomend this game 8/10 without any dlcs but i recomend the game 10/10 with the legendary edition.",1
"[warning] if you play this game you will lose track of time and get completly sucked in, its that good!!!!!",1
"brilliant soundtrack + outstanding open world graphics + unique gameplay to fit the players ideal playthrough + skyrim as a whole = one of the best games ever made.",1
"this game has been out for ages but it never gets old. if you havent already get the game! you wont regret it!",1
"i think that the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a great game. you can do pretty much everything you want, and to think how long it took bethesda studios to make this game is just unbelievable. this is one of my favorite games of all time, and i highly recommend it.",2
"an exciting storyline and very addictive gameplay, combined with modding this game will last you a very long time.",1
"another rpg game thats all gamer around the world dying for, worth the time spend, worth the headach, worth all the penny, worth to have it. best rpg ever from 2010 tll now. would recommend anyone anytime for buying this game.",1
"wanna kill dragons with a sword? do it. wanna steal stuff and put baskets on peoples heads? do that too. 40 hours in and i havent even started the main quest line. this games takes play your way to new levels. 11/10.",1
"so many hours lost on console if your getting on pc prepare to lose a lot more of your life",1
"i love how this game allows for (almost) unlimited exploring and leveling. the glitches i have found so far are not of mayor concern, its even fun to see mamoths flying xd i tottaly recomend this game to any rpg adventure lover.",1
"has always been my favorite game imo and i cant help but always having the need to play at some point. +rep to all bethesdas work!",1
"in all likelyhood, you will never run out of things to do in skryim. between the huge open world to explore, the great dlc expansions, and the huge host of content added by the community through mods, skyrim is an experience that is essentially timeless, and endlessly enjoyable. when the legendary edition goes for as low as $13 dollars during the summer sale, youd be insane not to own this game. highly recommend.",1
"the game of thrones of the video game world! the plot twists, story versatility, and depth of play far exceeded anything that i could imagine from a video game. several times ive already gotten chills, cheered for someone to die, and felt so many different emotions that a video game has never brought out before. this is by far the best game that i have ever played!",1
"great game!! legendary edition for less than $17 is a no brainer!!",1
"one of the best fantasy rpgs i have ever played. its like gta but you can be a human, an orc, lizards, or kahjit (cats), and all sorts of other creatures. and you can fight dragons that come at random times. and the map, well, its just 250 times bigger than new york city. and the elder scrolls online (different game) i was a beta tester and when i saw that map, it was bigger than the usa. but this game is singleplayer, which i like because its not monthly fee like the elder scrolls online. you can aslo chose to be a warrior (you can learn more attacks and things easily) you can be a wizard (you earn spells faster) or you can be a thief (you can learn lockpicking, pick-pocketing, and sneaking a lot faster). and a lot of people say that the game lags a lot. i have a really bad computer and i get atleast 40 fps so i dont know if those people are like playing a windows xp or something. so please get this game if you like these kind of games. totally worth $20 (well for me its like $4 because of sales). and remember, there is almost 100000 people who think its positive and 2000 people who think its negative... do the math....",1
"another brilliant title by bethesda, i played it for countless hours on my xbox and just had to get it on my pc!",1
"visually dissapointing. however is fantastic with mods, most of which are available from steam workshop.",1
"in what other game can you be a werewolf with 6 wives? 10/10",1
"really fun game that ive put a lot of hours into. looks good without mods and even beter with them. im able to get decent framerates and good graphics with my amd a8 when i feel like playing on my media pc with a controller. when using big picture you can almost get away with only using the controller but the first menu still requires a mouse so that is a minor inconvienience.",1
"so far pretty fun. i just wish it had a action bar like rift and wow does so i could get some extra use out of my razor naga mouse. kinda dumb that im a caster and have to use both hands to cast when i was watching the new lord of the rings last night and he had a sword and staff and could still cast. still a pretty fun game once you get the  weight removed from items you carry. stupidest idea ever specially for a kleptomaniac like myself. i have like 200,000 gold and i still steal everything in sight cause i just cant help myself. if its lootable its mine",1
"no matter what i do, i am a khajiit, and i dont know why.",1
"great game with epic moments and tons of weird things and bugs, but who cares. youneed this. 95/100",1
"really cool game. great graphics, okay storyline, lots of weapons and armours. magicka serverely underused though (asides from shouts). every interesting game. if you like previous elder scrolls than youll probably like this.",1
"i just cant stop playing and the only thing ive done is to level up to level 30 and im still having fun... my progression is pretty slow... but it is so awesome i cant stahp playing!",1
"this game really does not need a review wrote for it. undeniably one of the greatest games of all times! so much gameplay with so much stuff to sidetrack on.",1
"bought it for the computer because of all the amazing mods available. definitely a must play.",2
"if u lik gaem wit dargon and macgic and stuf then u will lik this gaem bcuz it has dargons that r rely gud and u can eat potins and u can be assin lik rel gud and stuf and you still a dargon bron.",1
"skyrim is known as one of the best games since it has won over 200 awards. not a lot of people remember the original elder scrolls but they dont remember/know how good the original elder scrolls are. this comes to skyrim, a very long game. if you buy the offical prime guide there is 1134 pages, no joke its real. you play as a prisioner that by luck escape from a dragon who destryoed the town ur in. the game is like a medival time scenery. you can literally do watever you want, even kill someone for no reason but youdo get a bounty from the nearest city which is not very fun considering if theres 5 guards fighting you. since this game is extremelly long, only like 2% from all systems actually beat this game 100% and they may have around 2,000 to 6,000 hours, yes its that dam long. so hope you enjoy this game and remember, pickpocket,kill,and rob everyone (just kidding, dont do it unless you want skill points)",2
"amazing and a worthy successor to its predecessor the elder scrolls 4: oblivion a must play, hours of fun and an almost endless exploration of the northern province of tamriel",2
"get it, whether you enjoy embarking on that epic quest, killing  or robbing people blind; get it.",3
"skyrim has got to be one of my favorite games of all time. bethesda always delivers in their games and does an excellent job enriching their open worlds with so much to do. i highly recommend this game to anyone who loves rpgs, or even those skeptics.",1
"my girlfriend dumped me, i dropped out of school, grew a neck beard, got fired, lost precious time of my life all because i wouldnt stop playing this game. 10/10.",1
"this game is amazing. mostly because its pretty impossible to be bored in it... theres just so much to do, and its so easy to tailor each experience into something completely different!",1
"this. is. the best. game on steam!!!!! seriously though, your never going to encounter a better game, exept maybe the sequel. pc gaming not your style, but you dont have a console? well for much less money you can go out and buy a controller and use that!",1
"great game. logged over 250 hours on the console and it was 250 great hours spent.",1
"its amazing how such a saint creation was born. bethesda did respectful job, but as always the modding community takes it to a whole new level. and how? basically you never get short of new content, its like christmas every single day. ode to the mod makers! and my god, there is enb what makes three-years-old game to look it just came out yesterday . i actually feel sad for those misrable players who experience this work of art on consoles. well the rating..? be warned! this game might, just might f*ck your entire life around. 10+/10, game is a godlike b!tch.",2
"no brainer. this is what aaa games should be. get it.",2
"if you like killing things and watching giant lizards fly then you will wanna have kids with this game.",1
"skyrim isnt a game. skyrim is a way of life. if you purchase skyrim, expect not to see your familly or friends for a very long time. you will laugh as you rain distruction on inocent villagers, cry when you defeat your first dragon, and you will pose in triumph after completing one of the guild questlines. to put it simply, skyrim is a game worth buying. just dont buy it wtih the expectation of stopping anytime soon.",2
"great game! i have 100+ mods from the steam workshop (none of which increase my individual status making the game easier for me to complete) that make the game even more enjoyable than it is originally through graphical enhancements and interface changes. i highly suggest this game for a great main story followed by many sub-stories and miscellaneous quests that will keep you busy for a very long time. im currently on my quest to 100% the game and im loving every minute of it.",2
"are you going to say you didnt already play this? -_- sigh awesome.... just awesome. skyrim is a good as you make it... now if get frustrated by too many opitons that might blow you mind, but if you dont talk to anyone until you have finished the quest your on, you should be fine. just dont finish the two main quest first the dragon born and the civil war, because they change the world around and kinda breakes the game; you could fix most of it but if youre not confortable with using the command line... just dont finish thoses quest untill you have gotten most major quests done within the holds(cities).",3
"i hate you skyrim. never have i spent more time doing mundane tasks like cooking and physical labor ingame than in real life.",1
"this game is amazing! the base game has hours of gameplay and content to explore and unlock but it really shines when you start downloading mods from the steam workshop. there are so many talented modders making new content for the game all the time. steam also has a free kit with which you can create your own mods and publish on the workshop! skyrim has a lot of replay value as it is very hard to play two saves exactly the same and you will often be surprised by what can happen! i have had this game on console for three years and pc for two and i am still not bored of it! all in all, if this game was a potato... it would be a good potato!",1
"even in its vanilla state i think this is a great game! sure it has many flaws, but even a run with only a few essential bug patches is highly enjoyable. but if you want to go through a truly wonderful experience dont hesitate and start doing heavy modding. the only place you will need is the nexus mods site, it has literally thousands of high quality mods in every category; texture replacements, npcs, followers, visual enhancements, improved quests, new sounds, bug patches, etc. that will suit anyones fancy and will make skyrim unsurpassable. i played this game before on a non-steam version and had tons of fun. im replaying it now with a renewed enthusiasm. i cant but highly recommend this game in its modded state. try it! you wont be disappointed!",3
"reach far horizons. farm endless grasslands. crush trolls & cie. 8.5/10",1
"i love it since the first day i played it. its an awesome game. it has everything i like. my goal is to reach level 100, im 38 now.",1
"this game is amazing. it is very fun. the modding community is probably the best around. i would but it again no doubt about it",1
"my family rejected me for turning into a dog. 420/10 needs more memes",1
"amazingly fun game, while still continuing on some aspects of play in oblivion the game engine has been rebuilt and streamlined allowing for a much smoother gameplay experiemce. play is fully open world, and while the radiant ai system can feel a bit repitive at times, theres never a lack of something to do.",1
"this game is very good if you have time to put into it. it is very action packed and makes you think. there is a hug world of modding to make it better. and remember stormcloaks are the best!!!",2
"ah skyrim, youre that one rpg game i keep returning to (i had it on the 360 first in 2011 before i got the pc version last year, so yes i have spent a fair amount of time on this game. just figured id point that out in case some  hat says, you only have 25 hours on the game!!! you havent even played it much !!@@@!@#$#$@#$%) back to the review. this game is unlike any other. there is literally so much you can do in this game and its addictive as hell, plus on the pc version of the game you can mod the ever living  out of it. mods that add to the core game, or mods that enhance the graphics by a bunch. i dont really like making long reviews, but i will say this. if you love rpgs or if you want to get into rpgs. get this damn game! it is worth every penny!",1
"this is by far one the best rpg that ive played. i would highly recommend it for anyone who has any doubt about getting it.",1
"must have. the game itself is another piece of art in tes series, and there is nothing that cant be changed with the mods! there is a whole ocean of different modifications, unofficial patches and so on. buy this game.",1
"i played this for 4 days it has been on the pc for a long time and now it wants me to buy it again",1
"despite being released a couple years ago, this game still remains an excellent play. i find myself picking it up every few weeks on xbox to play vanilla, and steam to just mod the hell out of it and get some laughs. even if youve never really played a game like skyrim before, there is hardly a learning curve. with plenty of positive reviews already out there im sure mine will get lost in the mix, however if you are contemplating buying this game, do it. but dont go crazy with mods right away, beat the storyline, kill your first dragon, fus ro dah someone into the side of a wall and watch their body go crazy. then install any mods you want, you can even kill thomas the train with your 20 foot man-meat if thats what gets you going. easily a 9/10",1
"best game i ever played but you need a awesome gaming computer to play on high settings",1
"so much hype for this game. should have bought it sooner.",1
"if nothing else, i recommend this game solely for the giants flying school. just walk up to any giant for a free lesson. ...survival is not guaranteed.",1
"i recommend this game for people who like a game with a lot of action and injoy a good fight",1
"one of the greatest games of all time. although it is still full of bugs and glitches several years on...",1
"so i guess that this is a rather late review. i have already played it for 74 hours on the ps and 50 hours on the pc. why do i still play it? details and mods baby, details and mods.",1
"must have! 141414141411142141241432525252421412441242546662 stars",1
"great game, but as all bethesda and ubisoft games it has its bugs. its very creative, has huge amounts of replayability and is extremely moddable. mods really make the game shine after your first 1-3 playthroughs without any. i cant really say more. overall 7.5/10 needs its bugs fixed to get a higher score.",1
"best game for me! it has some lag but, i think its just my computer xd.",1
"this game is great, im extremly happy i got this!",1
"i love this game i got so hocked to it and bead the game within 24 hours!!! i added the godess chest mod and got op gear. so go and start you adventure.",1
"after clocking in at almost 400 hrs, i still cant put it down. i highly recommend this game to every rpg fan especially those who are a fan of the elder scrolls.",3
"amazing game! totally worth your time. this game got everything !",1
"badass high graphic sci fi fantesy play this game for yourself beautiful game after you finish explore get the mods from workshop make a dubstep get the dlcs dawnguard adds vampires, dragonborn adds the very first dragonborn miraak find the epic game making you cry for more more yes yes we need more of course its a game duh but this graphic/badass game of the year is just tear dropping jaw dropping silent dragon slaying game of the year play it yourself try it im not forcing you just go on in..",1
"whether youve been playing the elder scrolls since it started in 1994, began in the heart of the empire in tes iv oblivion, or have never even heard of the series, this game delivers an amazing experience for all gamers. you will truly love this game.",1
"i highly recommend this game for anyone who likes rpgs with action, magic and ing dragons. the content is almost endless. (ive played almost 200 hours and i havent finished everything.) the dlcs are really fun aswell. although they are a powercreep, they still add a lot to the game. lots of new areas, items, monsters. but most importantly you can ride dragons. :d",1
"i fap to this game. not seriously... that would be really ing creepy",2
"amazing game. heaps of classes to choose from and various paths you can choose. whether it be an archer, a cold hearted assassin, or a brave and courageous warrior. skyrim is the game for anyone wanting a true rpg with realistic graaphics and fun gameplay. the main quest is great. while it is short, there are many side quests to do. it takes over 120 hours to finish the entire game. that is truly enormus! the game is open-world, and you have a sense over danger and exctitment rushing through you when you are exploring caves, looting dungeons, and more! skyrim is a fantastic game that anyone can play 9.5/10",1
"everything is awesome, everything is cool when youre playing skyrim ...",1
"best fantasy game ive ever played. amazing graphics for 2011 . the power to creat your own character is one of the best in elder scrolls series. you make your own choices. a vast and living world with no invisible walls that stop you from exploring ferther.",2
"do you like creepy people telling you their life story because you said hello to them? do you like traveling across 44 km^2 of in-game terrain to risk your life to find these creepy cardboard facsimiles of human beingss favorite bar of soap because they hold tremendous sentimental value? do you like deep combat systems that can be as complicated as smashing the attack button to see if your stat numbers are higher than their stat numbers? do you enjoy a mod community that dedicates 50% of their effort towards sexualizing characters or making them outright nude? then wipe your  dry and change your fruit of the looms, this games for you!",1
"i spent many hours playing this game mainley on consel. i recommend anybody that likes freerome or making decisions it is amasing and i recommend getting mods after you beat the main story.",1
"one hellavu gg! if you havent got it you need it!",1
"all the game has been carefuly made. a lot of funny and beautiful details. a great plot. is a game that i hard recommend to all who loves any kind of game. because i prefer shooters but this rpg is ftw. also there are tons of mods on the steam workshop or at the net.",1
"the elder scrolls v : skyrim is one of the best games i played in 2013, possibly the most immersive and addicting game ive played as far as i know right now. its been 3 years already and i still have more dungeons to delve, trolls to slash and bandits to shout off cliffs. i definitely reccomend this as a 10/10 game!",2
"mile wide and an inch deep, just like your mom, ey ohhhh. however overall very fun specialy with mods, again just like your mom.",1
"the elder scrolls series have always been one of my favorite game series. a huge world, fully voiced npcs, tons of quests, engaging combat and infinite reasons to replay it. add that with the open modding community and you have a seemingly immortal game. they improved the combat alot in the game, added new possible play styles and improved the overall a.i. its got a few nostalgia bits in it aswell as tons of new content. its really a one of a kind experience. your adventure awaits!",1
"i enjoy the elder scroll series and i do enjoy skyrim but sometimes you just run into a mess of troubles but with sandbox games youre likely to run into them i would recommend buying this game for those who want to play a nice rpg",1
"quite possibly the greatest game ever made at the moment. free roam rpgs are the future! now to get this delorean to 88mph so i can play future games of this style! fallout 4 next please.",3
"longest single player game ive done my entire life- the hours just keep on rollin. recommend modding after vanilla =3",1
"finally bought game in steam, 1010 guys, the game is really awesome",1
"check my player time. would i really play a game this much if it sucked?",4
"bethesda is by far one of my favorite developers. skyrim has been one of my favorite rpgs in a long time. the story is deep, gameplay is rich, and the environment is simply stunning. i played originally on xbox 360 but find the pc version to look so much better and plays a lot better as well. it is not as deep as older rpgs in the leveling system but offers a very fresh take on character customization. if you are familiar with any of their other games in the last few years (i.e. fallout 3/nv or oblivion) then it will feel very familiar. you can easily lose hours (or days...) in this game without even realizing it. the game is very immersive and has a lot of replayability. i have yet to get bored in the world of skyrim. if you are a fan of the fantasy rpg genre and have played any of bethesdas other games then this is a must have for any gamers collection.",1
"one of the best open world rpgs ever made. from the extensive crafting system to the side quests with the mage guild or the thieves guild, to the dlc with building a house and having a farm, there are random things to do for everyone.",1
"while i have no doubt this game will require a lot of time to learn and a lot of time to stay involved, the visuals are stunning and having not played a real rpg in some time, i missed the deep story aspects of a game. so much funner than a simple fps and a few dungeon crawlers with no real storyline. awesome!",1
"this game has a very expansive story wich is extremely interesting devouring dlc and worlderful player design 110% recomend this",1
"once you see the ending and fool around with the graphics mods a bit theres nothing to do. people who played this game for longer than 50 hours is the same group of people as those who play second life seriously.",1
"one of the best game of all time !! i cant wait for the online one !",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an amazingly addictive game that will hold your interest. the adaptations and creations of the games followers create an ever evolving world that is sure to entertain.",1
"killing dragons was fun and epic. game was kind of easy after a while.",1
"skyrim is, simply put, an ocean with the depth of a pond. it will keep you entertained for hours on hours with its mass of things to do and explore. but if youve come to change the world, this is the wrong place. nothing ever changes in skyrim and your actions have little to no impact on the world around you. skyrim is at its best when exploring the vast and beautifuly designed world, finding dungeons, looting everything that isnt nailed to the floor and moving on. though if you expect the world to react and change according to your actions youll be bitterly dissapointed. this game is a great sandbox and you can sink a lot of time into it, especially if you take into consideration all the mods that are out there but if youre looking for a meaningful story and having an impact on the world this is not the game youre lloking fir. overall this game is very well worth the price of admission especially if you pick it up on a sale, but be careful you might lose a few days if not weeks worth of hours if you get sucked into its dungeon crawling and exploring. enjoy and have fun!",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",1

"going full hamington in to bandit camps for a chance of ale and other loot is allways good, though doing this verus dragons and gaints is not allways so wise, as getting nomed or flying 50 feet in the air kinda hurts.",1
"played this game on consoles and bought it again on pc its alot of fun and a great way to kill alot of time",1
"skyrim was and still is amazing. tired of fps? here you go , a nice step back in time were you can kill some mythical creature with a multiude of weapons or spells. you will have plenty hours of fun becuase there are a large number of side missions that can be started anytime you want. then once you find yourself bored of the game download a ton of mods that will make the game even better .",1
"ultimatly the best fantasy rpg that you come apon!",2

"tesv skyrim.... simply brilliant rpg worthy of any gamer, casual or hardcore. very enjoyable, and loads of playtime to offer. instant reccomendation.",1
"almost 3 years after its release and its still amazing",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is the best game ive ever played. the amount of detail and care put into making this game its insane! ive put close to 800 hours into it and im still finding new places, people, and quest. once you finish one quest line, you just move on to the next. from killing dragons and taking their souls, to casting a firestorm spell to wipe out huge amounts of enemys this game has it. the world is yours in this game, and theyre no accidents. be who you wanna be weather it be elf, beast, or man. overall this game is amazing. there are still a few bugs present but just save often and you should be fine. if you want the rpg game of the decade, and hours of dragon slaying and shouting words of power to freeze or burn your foes, then this is it. fus ro dah!",5
"fallout is sci-fi. skyrim is fantasy. i got confused when i played oblivion, i got enthralled when i play skyrim. great game!",3
"i killed a chicken and the whole village attacked me. 10/10.",1
"i have to be honest: im only doing this because its an account achievement. having said that, this game is awesome. i have already played it for 544 hours and i still havent done everything, quite the contrary, actually. i also recently bought the dlcs and from what ive seen so far, those are awesome as well. highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. cheers!",3
"great game, i keep coming back. packed full of content, though truthfully some things could be done better. luckily bethesda has one of the greatest mod communities around, so that makes it even bettter.",2
"my favourite game in whole world!! absolutely amazing! however if you do choose to use mods within the game, do be careful since it may affect gameplay and setting may have to be ruduce to maintain a sufficient fps. otherwise absolutely brilliant!",2
"put 300+ hours into this game on my previous account. buy it, you wont regret. 10/10",1
"a great game by itelsef, but when coupled with the steam workshop, or better yet, the skyrim nexus website, the great mods available make this a must have.",5
"addictive as hell and ill be playing 24/7 without relizing half the time. i played from 8 a.m to 6 a.m the next day and didnt relize it till i looekd over to the clock.",1
"spent 80% of playtime either walking or watching loading screens. 8/10 - great",1
"you would be  not to waste your life on this epic game.",1
"love this game, but you might want to clear up month or two.",3
"one of the greatest snadbox rpgs ever. amazingly replayable and horrendously fun to play no matter what. the workshop stretches the longevity of this game, just as it did previously within the elder scrolls series, to years and years.",1
"while not quite as good as tes iii: morrowind, this game is lightyears ahead of oblivion. if youve only played oblivion in the past, or are even completely new to the series, this game will blow you away. be prepared for hours of doing whatever the heck you want, because the massive open world is teeming with non-essential dungeons and quests that will leave you in the icy reaches of skyrim searching for that one last thing. there are only a few things that make this game short of perfect, and to most players, these are but trivial details. this game is worth every cent.",1
"with all the dlc plus the mods available, esv: skyrim is simply the best single player adventure rpg out there... and will be for a long time",1
"this may be the best rpg on steam. the world is so open and there is so much to do, and with all the mods, you can add hundreds of more hours to the already growing hours of the game, a must buy!",1
"one of the best rpgs i have played. spoderman recommmends.",1
"i love it, it gave me 2 years of fun, i played every playstyle, every race, every way, every dlc. i been from a straight up heavy armor warrior with a huge battleaxe that can turn into a werewolf, and could stand still taking every hit from a dragon without losing almost any health. to a master thief who isnt very strong but can sneak through a entire bandit camp without being seen once.. all the way to guy who never killed a soul, worked hard for his money chopping wood. managing to build his own house and have a family. the main story with all the guilds you can join and areas to explore, you wont be bored for a long time. so dont just rush the main story and assume you seen it all. out of the dlcs, the best would be dragonborn. it offers a large new world, enemies, quests, armors and weapons. while the dawnguard only offers a bit and a vampire lord form, and hearthfire just lets you adopt kids and build homes. the worst thing about it, is there will be bugs, which can easily be fixed by console commands. but only use if needed, like after 5 retrys a quest wont finish or continue. 8/10 only because it can get far too easy, and the bugs. you get stronger than all the enemies too quickly. so i say when you learn the game better, go on master or legendary difficulty for a challenge.",3
"with the tools and modification files around for this single player role playing game and the awesome graphical and world features, make this a pretty darn good game if you are into lore and questing. you choose the path you want to take, the strengths and professions. in quest questions determine which way you go with all. top marks and well worth the coin. i have not yet played any of the other races available, just the nord male and female - just by creating these two and following thebasic warrior class, the difference between difficulty is astoundingly different. the male, smithing was the main profession with most perks going into heavy armour, smithing, destruction and two handed weapons. points for magicka, health & stamina swung more to health and stamina. the female, i tried following the same path but found it too difficult to use the two handed straight off, so archery was the main weapon of this character, with most perks going into sneak, archery, light armour.",2
"the mods available for this game, as well as the game itself without any mods are just amazing! i always find myself coming back to this game!",1
"great game with virtually no flaws. really really epic due to the endless mods and the game has amazing long-gevity. 91/100",1
"i dont really think you need any convincing here, buy it, love it end of story.",1
"wether you played previous elder scrolls games or not, this will suck you in and wont let you go. if the main quest doesnt bring you all the entertainment you need, the near endless side quests will take up all your time. and having access to almost any kind of mod that you need will enhance the gameplay more than you can imagine. its not a game for everyone, but at least give it a shot.",1
"promised myself i would be a warrior with zero sneak kills... well... maybe next playtrough... or maybe the next... or the next... thieves guild here i go again.",2
"great game, worth the money. dont buy the dlcs though.",1
"great game, full of tricky combat, but at the same time, it can be quite difficult at times (for new users at least) there is a lot of stuff the game has, that you dont know about, which you want, for example tab opens a series of menus which you can use to level up, and more i didnt find this out until quite far in to the game, but overall, very, very good game.",1
"everyone kills the chicken. 7.8/10 too much water.",1
"what i love about skyrim is that it has a lot of replay value in that you can play so many different characters in so many different ways. the only problem is that after playing through several times (on xbox and on steam) i got tired of being dragonborn and wanted to be someone entirely different.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an amazing, enticing open world with vast quanities of things to do. whether it be fighting off legendary dragons or delving deep into the ancient dwemer ruins, it is impossible to get bored. the music is exhilarating and triumphant, the gameplay is stupendous, the languages within the game are linguistically beautiful and you feel like the characters are one with your family. after indulging for hours on end playing this game, youll find your self-impowerment increasing and you will feel like the dovakhiin, or, dragonborn. the soul of a warrior... (i recomend playing at an adept or legendary game difficulty or the game will seem a bit slow) -enthusiastic",1
"game of the year hands down. the greatest game that every came out this year. hours upon hours of gameplay. you will be out of contact when you start to play this game...",1
"great for anyone looking for a game that can do it all. choose how you want to play without limitation. i for one enjoy games that allow you to sneak and get through many conflicts with a few well placed arrows. i was pleasantly surprised to realize that there are many sneaky passages and tricks to exploit. with a strong modding community this is a game that will run strong for a very long time.",1
"lots of potential but the combat system is dry and uninspired, getting boring very quickly. the dialogue is a bit tedious and for all of the possibilities for character development, it still feels very one dimensional.",1
"insane amount of quests! almost from the get go, you are put on a path to... well.. to wherever is it you are going. either you stay focused with the main story line (yeah, right! as if it was even possible!) or you take off and do any of the other dozens of quests you always seem to have. awesome enchanting to make even the most mundane weapons pack a ton of heat and on and on. great game overall. get it.",1
"bette with mods. dragon fights could have been made a little harder to be honest, since both trolls and giants are a lot more dangerous. ice magic is kind of bad given how many enemies are ice resistant, since this is the frozen north of tamriel. good game worth playing.",1
"very exciting game once you start off, but unfortuately you realise the simplicity and lack of depth as you play more and more. combat is hack and slash, many quests are cloned fetch or complete this dungeon quests, and dungeons lack true diversity because there are so many. paraphrasing totalbiscuit, the game is the size of an ocean with the depth of a paddling pool. it is a shame because the game has potential. mods can definitely improve your experience if youre willing to experiment but it can take time to compile a list and install them for your perfect experience. ive been wanting to do this for a while. although my review appears negative, skyrim will provide you with many hours of enjoyment before it gets repetitive even without mods, so i do recommend it.",2
"why is this game so addicting? despite the bugs, and yes, there is plenty, i would still recommend this game to any and all of my video game loving friends. that is all.",1
"massive world and great mechanics. only drawback: the inventory was quite difficult to use but there are so many mods to solve such problems,",2
"if youve ever played free roam games you probably think they are unexciteing undefined games like minecraft. well tkae this, with a map the size of tenesee hd graphics and interactability with nearly everything not to mention that it is modded by anyone form derogan to the next steam noob. this is by far the most complex game you have or ever will play. but let me warn you... this game is so detailed and life like that whenever my charictar died i almost had a heart attack seeing as to how into the game i felt. you will happily spend the rest of you pixilated life in skyrim. i would tell you more but i took and arrow to the knee. now i am just going to end this there because ive got some dragons to kill, untill next time. oh and if you dont like this game then ive got a list of swear words the size of skyrim just for you (trust me when i say that is one d*** long list)",2
"ummmm, its skyrim. thats all you need to know. its amazing. get mods and now its even more amazing.",1
"i have bought this game twice so i would totaly recommend it.",1
"i cant stop playing this game, somebody please help.",3
"provides hours of fun! great game alone or with workshop mods!",1
"excelent game with great story line it is a little buggy at sometimes but 9/10",1
"do not play this game if you still care about your life, this game snatch it all!",1
"cant recommend this to anyone who likes a good rpg its a action game at best. magic is broken if your a mage your screwed later in the game, story is terrible, npc basically serve no perpose other than taking up space, quest are linear & dull, nothing you do has consequence, crafting & enchating is broken these are just a few of the many things wrong with it.",1
"best single player fantasy gam ever. or ignore if not your thing",1
"everyone has played this game because it is fantastic. if you havent and are just now considering the purchase i would let any loved ones know that you are alive.",1
"stepping into skyrims world is like wrapping yourself in a furry, nordic cloak that smells like your childhood blanket. yes, the oblivion you remember fondly is back  everything that made the last elder scrolls so lovable has returned. yet now its a bit wilder, a bit rougher, and a bit more dangerous, and boy is the game better for it. whereas cyrodiil, the province from oblivion, was a fairly typical temperate climate with deciduous forests and gentle rolling hills, skyrim is a bitter, cold northern region (remember those impassable mountains in the north of cyrodiil? skyrim is just beyond them). this doesnt mean the game world is a monotonous frozen waste: the land is diverse, but it has a wonderful tone to it that is very much viking axe clanking and visible frosty breaths huddled around crackling fires. its forbidding, slightly bleak, and yet also incredibly cozy when you come in from the cold.",1
"total play time upon writing this review: pc: 210 hours xbox 360: about a billion years endlessly replayable game, with hundreds of side quests to waste your life on. plus, the fantastic modding community that this game has means you will never run out of things to do. and theres a mod which makes chickens explosive. enough said. 10/10 would destroy my social life all over again.",1
"great open world setting, loads of quests and places to explore. different classes and play styles to fit your personality, play how you want! 10/10.",1
"this game has followed me from console to machine, used to play for hours and hours on the ps3, and now that its on sale on steam i thought why not, love this game as it is, but... steam workshop + skyrim..... enough said...",1
"not bad so far, ill play a few more hours and decide if its any good",5
"a fantastic game that ticks almost all the boxes of a single player rpg aswell a stunning soundtrack, which kept me enthralled through the game, not to say that it is without its flaws. dragon fights became repetative after the first couple and they are easy compared to other creatures (bears, trolls). i have played this on xbox 360 and enjoyed it but the one thing that worried me about playing this through on pc was that id done this all before... sure the graphics were better and there werent any where as near as many crashes but going through the intro for the 20th time i felt like i may have wasted 20. that was until i discovered mods. there are so many to choose from and make the experience new and fresh in almost every way from new armor and weapons, to new places to go and diffrent soundtracks. downloading and installing were as simple as clicking a box. this is a definate must have for any pc gamer!",1
"if this game was a potato, it would be a good potato",1
"ouh yeah! skyrim + dawnguard, lets go hunt vampires with dragon curtains pulled, and them explosive crossbow darts? welcome to the elder scrolls - van helsing.",4
"awesome gameplay , graphics and diversity , a really good game. plus , with the mods and other modifications , youll love it even more !",1
"what can i say its skyrim. best rpg,fresh gameplay, good voice acting, decent graphics, yada yada yada you get the point its excellent 9/10 almost flawless but gliches and repetive quests is the only reason it isnt 10/10",1
"compared to oblivion this is an improvement, but it still has its faults. most of the rpg elements have been dubbed down or removed. the gameplay itself is fine but they have added aspects like regenerating health to make it more appealing to a wider audience. the games modding community, like oblivion is a blast! you can get rid of these casualized aspects with a few mods, also the game looks absolutely beautiful, im excited to see fallout 4 run on this engine! if you want a good time buy this but if you want and es game with more rpg elements, go get marrowind. not saying to avoid this game but if youre looking for something more complex this isnt that appealing, should you buy it if you loved marrowind and/or oblivion? of course! just beware. 9.3/10",1
"one of the best time sinks money can buy. with all the workshop content the game never ends, 150hrs on console and bought it again for pc.",1
"if you want the best rpg out there right now, the elder scrolls v: skyrim is for you. this is one of my personal favourites, alongside dragon age and mass effect (even though i was not satisfied with how the final mass effect ended). it has the same type of everlasting questlines, which i happen to really love. i wouldnt say its a difficult game, but its not exactly easy either. fairly simple to pick up on, too. even the mind of a more casual player could get the hang of it in the first few sessions they play it. skyrim is an amazing game and i would advise anyone who loves a long lasting, epic game to play this. there are so many choices...and it never really ends.",1
"extremely replayable. infinite missions, easily modded, many skills. huge, open world. the only problems: magic is underpowered archery is overpowered smithing, enchanting, and alchemy, if abused, make the game too easy no kinect (this game is actually better with kinect) worth its full price. i had in on xbox, and then bought it again for steam. the dragonborn dlc is the best, but most mods require dawnguard.",1
"although i havent played the previous elder scrolls games, i fell in love with skyrim. this is truly (in my opinion) on of my favorite games of all time. spectacular voice acting accompanies an engrossing story that leaves you wanting more, not wanting to stop playing. there was a time that i felt bored with the gameplay or stories. with so many different play-through styles and characters to create, you will get your moneys worth for sure. but, im sure that you all ready know that already. so what are you doing still reading this?? go get this game!!!",1
"skyrim is definitely one of the best games of 2011 and its like a music album that has a few tracks that you arent particularly fond of, but rest of the music is pure aural blliss that you cant help but think of the album as close to perfection as possible.",1
"clunky, really bad and also poopy menues and the removal of all skills except moar healthz, moar magix and moar hitting and carrying stuff aside, this is a relevation compared to oblivion - which was admittedly fun but an increasingly guilty pleasure as the ooh shiny effect wore off and the cracks began to show more and more. enemies still autolevel but its way less . distant land looks actually good and not like some god of bad textures  all over it. npcs dont have horrible bloated moonfaces. gamebryo got aborted (ho ho) and replaced with an engine rendering stuff in plastic mode off. theres now a perk system which requires some planning if you wanna get the most out of your character. major cons are again the bad ui (hai xbawks) and some really aggravating bugs requiring serious console magic. follower ai is semi-ok. people dont talk about mudcrabs and lockpick experts all day anymore but the soundquips get repetitive too. nomorespacebuyifyouhaventalready.",1
"such an amazing game even just with the vanilla version, however with mods on pc the options are endless!!! even at full price this game is well worth the money, but on sale this is a no brainer to buy. also very much worth it to check out the dlc.",5
"this game is flippin amazing! violent though. a must-buy!",1
"this is the best open world rp game ive ever played :)",1

"youre a wrongfully convicted criminal, who escapes in the confusion of a dragon attack, to find out youre a dragon and you can transform in to your dragon form at any given moment and burn cities to the ground... why wouldnt you buy this game???",1
"this game set the standard of any rpg i have played since. bethesda has done an amazing job.",2
"freaking amazing!!! this game lets you do virtually whatever the hell you want and i love it for it! i have played a bit of morrowind and im not a huge fan bucause of the mass difficulty of it but i love skyrim! i want everybody reading this with enough money to buy this to go get it right now! take it from me, its worth a measly $30! its worth $100!",1
"the elder scrolls series has never failed to impress me, and skyrim is outstanding.",1
"ive spent a lot of time in skyrim, i think the thing that keeps bringing me back is the vastness of the world. there are a lot of places to explore and theres tons of lore and interesting stories to find and investigate. whenever i play skyrim, i almost always discover new, and i think thats amazing. unfortunately the wide as the ocean, shallow as a puddle criticism is well-deserved, as a player you rarely feel like youre really changing anything in the world, youre more like a very stabby spectator. i play skyrim on the low graphics setting, and its still beautiful. it does have some issue with texture pop, but i would put that down to my computer not having a very good graphics card. skyrim is obviously extremely well-optimized. controls on pc are well-designed and easily customizable.",2
"honestly, im having the time of my life playing this.",2

"a game like no other bethesda is the greatest game creator of all time",1
"skyrim is an amazing game. ive put 109 hours into this masterpiece and do not regret it. the story is a bit short imo but the side missions and the open world bring you a whole lot of stuff to do. run up mountains. enter dungeons / caves. ride a horse. kill a dragon. buy a house. get married. etc. and btw, 10/10 for using consolecommands and changing my name into jesus and flying up to the skies. edit: played a bit of skyrim last night, went on a horse. and had the power to fly...incredible 11/10",1

"when i first bought skyrim in 2011, it was the ps3 version (and dont get me wrong, that was an amazing experience!) but i had never gave the pc version a glance until late 2013 and i was amazed at how many of you actaully liked it better on the pc. so when christmas came around, i deleted my old skyrim save, and put it back in its case and gave it to my little sister who had wanted to play it for the past 2 years. after that, i went out and bought myself the pc version, and i dont regret my decision. its easily one of the best games on the pc that ive ever played and i wouldnt refund it...ever! so if your looking for a really good game that, practically, goes on forever...this is your game! youll have a blast with the dragons, creepy skellies, the epic mods for the game, secret areas, hidden items, and the quests in general (coughdaedriccough). i can almost guarantee you, that youll never get tired of this game.",1
"just finished my first playthrough which lasted 235 hours. still found myself craving for more..",1
"skyrim definitely lives up to its fame easily. everything about it is amazing, even counting its arguably clunky combat.",2
"i spent 14 literal day of my life playing it, so it isnt that bad.",2
"a must have for any rpg fan, no need to say anymore it has everything you could ever want",2
"this game is resonsible for taking days of my life",1
"awesome game, great to see another era in a another part of tamriel",3
"well, i usually do not write a review until i have finished the game, or at least put enough hours into it to make sure i know most of the game content, but skyrim is a different story. in fact, the story is amazing, the conbat feels a lot better and gameplay all around is amazing. the graphics are really good also if you have a nice machine to ramp up to ultra settings. the set pieces are amazing also. most times you wander into a town, duneon or any other area and it just bewhilders you of the amazing artistry that is present. the music and sound is also amazing! we cannot leave out the new perk system. like fo3, every level you gain, you get to invest a perk into any of the trees available, and wow, there are many. i could go on, and on about the great things of skyrim, but i will hit a bad note. the interface. in fact, i have no idea why they have messed up the interafce so bad since others have done it well. great game overall, but the interface is probably the biggest downside.",1
"besides of massive bugs and sometimes a very weird balancing - the most enjoyable rpg since some time.",1
"the modding activity here and on the nexus still makes this game playable after so long",1
"really good fun! this game will keep you entertained for as long as you let it and even now when i occasionally go on ill see a flying giant and fall straight back in love with it. this is like the angelina joelie of gaming.",1
"no matter what i do, i am a khajiit, and i dont know why.",1
"i really cant say any more than everyone else already has. skyrim is a great base game that turns into an unstoppable, near-perfect monster with enough mods. the only bad thing about it is its time consuming. if you work a lot, like i do, you probly wont be able to play it as much as you would like if you enjoy variety (and sleep) with your gaming. easy 10/10",1
"what can i say about skyrim? best f#!king game ever made!",1
"skyrim doesnt come close to oblivion, but since there is no oblivion hd, itll do!",1
"a lot of fun! in the world of skyrim ive had time for all the activities you expect out of any decent game! sometimes the game gave me headaches like when you meet a dragon halfway through a hard mission, it usually went this way: 1. have a dragon interrupt you in the middle of an important mission 2. get killed by said dragon multiple times 3. kill the dragon 4. pack your backpack with the dragons skin and bones 5. walk increadibly slow towards nearest town because youre carrying to much weight 6. sell his skin and bones 7. profit 8. remember you had a mission in the former area 9. go back 10. meet dragon 11/10 would love to play again",1
"never thought i would play a single player game this much. with all the mods and addons, i see no end in sight.",1
"one of my favorite games ever made is the elder scroll series and this game was nothing short of amazing",1
"this is my all time favriout game i have cloaked in hundreds of hours yet still love it.",2
"awesome game, 9/10 if gets a mac version 9000/10 get it while the holiday sales last 15 dollars is cheap",1
"open world freedom to explore what you want when you want. in addtioion to the workshop the amount of user content is absured and entertaining. a must get for people who love exploration and senseless killing of things.",2
"the ability to mod this and other edler scrolls games is truly a significant strength. currently i have 200+ mods installed that bring the quality and depth of the game up from where it all started on release day.",2
"skyrim is the one of the best games to play, able to capture the attention of any that play it, difficult to be fun, but not difficult to be annoying, plenty of quests to do as well as just explore the massive expanse that is the world of skyrim. makeing the deal of buying the game sweeter, working with steam workshop allows you to create a whole new world through the power of mods. great game, if get it on sale even better.",1
"this is my all time favorite game, (excluding minecraft,) but i love the way the npcs dont just say one thing over and over again, (unless you make them.) the graphics are amazing, and i just cant believe how much work was put into this game, but all in all, this game is epic!!!!",1
"amazing game, as you would expect from an elder scrolls. the many items/locations/playstyles and customizations will make you love this game for a long time. not to mention the free-roam/open world aspect of the game. i found just wandering around and not knowing what i might come across very cool. this game can still surprise you after hundreds of hours of playtime. sounds and music are also great. if i could only have one game, itd be skyrim :)",1
"if dragons were real i probably wouldnt have sex with one",1
"insanely fun with mods. beaten 2 times and have done alot of questing.",2
"spent a little bit of time playing this and heres what you need to know if your iffy about buying this game. 1. this game requires patience in some matters due to npcs being very slow at times. 2. you can fast travel through areas if you dont wish to walk. (i recommend walking to ares because you can get cool random encounters and the scenery is pretty nice looking.) 3. the combat system in this game is great, although high level magic can kill you really easily. 4. always remember to save, if you die and havent saved recently ggnore. that is all. 8/8 not enough water.",2
"immersive, engaging and expertly designed. sets the standard for open-world rpg games.",1
"since i bought and played the game, i realised that this is my favourite role play game (short rpg). ive always liked rpgs like the warcraft series, and played the mmo. but skyrim has elements that i didnt find in world of warcraft: the feeling of importance of your character in-game. that is a rpg, and thats a rpg i love to play. by the way. i recommend skyrim for all fantasy / medival / rpg fans that plans on buying the game or are just reading this message. thats what i have to say, and thank you betesda. ill play the prequels someday.",3
"played hundreds of hours on console picked it up off steam..... still addicted biggest bang for your buck you could possibly ask for.",1
"this game is so much fun. the environments are varied and epic. tons of quest, freeform adventuring and the auto director generates just enough content to make it interesting to slow-travel.",1
"the vanilla game was not fun, i wanted to like the game but i did not. the game had bugs and glitches that ruined the game for me. the quests were boring and not exiting. the game lacks ranged combat, only having a bow, which i do not like because it only reaches medium distances. leveling up in the game is too slow, it feels like you earn nothing for leveling up. none of the good skills can be unlocked early in a skill tree which is boring. the sneaking and bounty system seems broken, even if a bounty is removed guards will sometimes still be hostile. some npcs in the game cant be killed and will constantly attack the played which is a broken mechanic of the game. some parts of the game will despawn all dead bodies making it imposible to revive a follower since their body dissapears. followers die which is realistic but not to my liking. horses are almost pointless, they run slow and seem lathargic. character models look ugly",1
"this game is awesome but theres this bug that i want to point out when you find the vampire kings daughter and return here and you become a vampire yourself the first quest im stuck on or my game is glitchy because i looked at youtube and nothin g worked... but i hope more skyrim comes out and this awesome game stays populare (if you can msg me on what to do with this glitch i would adimre your help)",1
"well, what else could i possibly say about this game.... simply a masterpiece!",2
"one of the most thrilling games i ever played. nearly 100 hours of gamplay and not even roughly seen everything. you can also spend the same amount of time browsing countless mods, one more beautifull and exciting than the other one. not even some bugs cane destroy the fun, only make it more hilarious. thumps up for this masterpice of a game. :))",1
"you should buy this because of all the crazy and weird modz you can install and plus to test the extent of how powerful you computer id and it still looks good even on low setting and it runs smoothly",1
"this game is okay, i guess. i mean, 100+ hours of gameplay, lot of mods, open world, varied combat options, etc. meh.",1
"heres what you need to know about skyrim: redguard = ers dunmer = jews argonians = george w bush imperials = white people nords = superior white people wood elves= hippies high elves = gays khajit = spics bosmer = trannies",1
"animations are sometimes crappy, bugs come up here and there and ai is just tragic. with that said the game is one of the best that i played; huge, epic, beautiful and looooong (counting with the sidequests). its a sin not to play skyrim!",1
"its one of the few games in my libary that i can go back to year after year and still find it intresting. the mod support is also the best of any game this generation.",1
"as the fifth installment in the elder scrolls series, skyrim had a lot to live up to. i believe that it has lived up to the legacy, and the mod support is great in this game. its a little pricey, but still a good game.",2
"lets just face it, the combat is terrible and this series is becoming more and more casualized as the years go by....but then again youre reading this review on steam, which means that we can mod this game, we have the technology. i really recommend going to the skyrim nexus and picking up a couple of overhaul and immersion mods in order to get the most enjoyment out of this title. here are the main mods i would recommend: > t3nd0s skyrim redone > deadly dragons > all of the unofficial patches > frostfall - hypothermia camping survival > skyui (needs skse)",2
"one of the best games i have ever played, stunning graphics and lots of quests to keep you occupied. even after completing the main questline there are still many other sidequests, not to mention the many mods available. anyway this is by far one of the most immersive, best games i have ever played.",1
"so many mods so fun thomas the tank engine xd great game wow",1
"they best elder scorlls game and probably bethsedas best game",1
"i find it too easy in some parts, but good graphics. i havent tried any mods yets, but there has been a 75% sale for this before .. just wait.",1
"good rpg kinda old but hey its amazing epic and....... yeahhh you get the picture 10/10",1
"skyrim is a great game so long as you have every possible disgusting mod out there. its basically not worth playing unless you have realistic bouncing boobs and balls installed. i find that it works great with joromirs jiggly, jug-antic jugs and true  pounding v3 (dont upgrade to v4, there is a problem which causes tearing). anyways, to be honest, i havent actually played much of the game so far. between troubleshooting mods and stopping to masturbate every couple of minutes, ive only just managed to finish making a character. great fun!",1
"is there anything to say? great game, buy it at any price!",1
"really really really awesome game, seriously, the unmodd game is amazing to play, then go through the workshop and just wow, the players have outdone themselves with mods for this game, from simple changing the color of a flower to outright amazing homes and quests, followers and weapons. play as a nord hero/villian the first time, then join the force and break out your lightsabers with the workshop mods, quite worth playing over and over and over <3",1
"really fun game with mods. lots to do either way :)",1
"this game is addictive and very immersive, aslo the modding community is great nd i have lots of fun playing and exploring mods. 10/10",1
"bethesda has done it again, a truely magnificent open-world rpg.",1
"meh. its pretty fun once you mod it, but still gets kinda dull fairly quickly.",1
"before you point out my low playtime on record, know that i only obtained skyrim on this account recently. i have done multiple completionist playthroughs and have been spending significant amounts of time modding over the past year. skyrim is a massive game by itself, but add on the massive modding community and you have a game which is just as endless as minecraft. the power of mods is a force to be reckoned with, with enough mods installed you can turn skyrims graphics from mediocre to unmatched. despite this, the sheer scope of the vanilla game means that it is still a highly enjoyable experience. with all this in mind, i can say one thing for certain: you have to buy this game.",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",1
"great game unlimited potential with modding hours of gameplay 10 out 10",1
"amazing game with a great modding comunity. it is playable for hours on end with so much to explore. 10/10 my type of game",1
"goty 2011 - epic all the way ! inc. one of the best scores and main themes for a game sons of skyrim. do not hesitate... this is one of the few exceptions, where the contet you get, compared to the money you pay, is most definitely in your favor.",2
"if youre looking for a crpg in the deep system, tactical combat, good story and competently-written dialogue kind of way, this really isnt your game, and it wasnt mine. if you want a mindless hiking sim with nice graphics, modability, simple combat, lack of depth and choice, and go through the same dungeon over and over again for no good reason, look no further. youll love it. just wait for a sale. please.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim one of the best steam games ive ever played. 10 - 10",1
"i saw the dragon do some air show to entertain me.",1
"what can i really say that you dont already know? if you dont/ havent owned this game yet, you should probably go jump off a cliff... in-game, once you buy this... because of my review.",1
"skyrim is such a fun game with many hours of gameplay with many paths to choose as the dragonborn of tamriel.",1
"it may be getting a bit of a old game now, and even though it has no multiplayer its still an amazing game",1
"this game, despite the hatred it gets from so many people, is an enjoyable experience with a very immersing plot. if you enjoyed morrowind and have a passion for elder scrolls games (by which i mean the only true rpgs out there), you might be dissapointed, but i usually lose myself in the background lore to such an extent that im not really bothered. essentially i turn into a scholar whenever i play this game.",2
"combat in this game is very weak however were lucky enough that this game has full mod support so modders got that taken care of. overall its a really fun game with a lot of flaws but can easily be solved thanks to a very active modding community",1
"amazing game!!! definately one of the best games of this genre out there atm.",1
"one of the few games i go back to again and again. the ability to install mods and maps via the workshop means that even if you park this game for a few months and come back, you can easily add more content via the press of a button, also allowing the difficulty curve to be tailored to suit for combat, exploration, or simply loot hording.",1
"it is a game with a very beautiful atmosphere and it has a great story and soundtracks too.",2
"great overall game.i have spent countless hours on this in xbox360 and nearly finished the game entirely. im willing to do the same on here but this time with mods and probably could use a better graphics card and a bigger hard drive",1
"this game is worth it. right now you can got everything for the game for $20. without mods its a great game with a lot of base content to enjoy, ill emit with some glitches and bugs. but with mods, this game is a wonderland of fun, with so much to do its overwhelming how much content there is. this game is easily a 8/10, a must buy, if you havent bought it already.",1
"well what can say about this well i think that in the elder scrolls world that skyrim is one the best beacuse of how it drawn you in too the gane so fast and puls as a bounce you can add any type mod that you can really think to in va by the steam workshop or something els and that it by it self add at lot too the game just by that for me i love skyrim it one of my favorts game of all time and all will be",3
"skyrim is game where dragon. but also is dragon. dragon and dragon, but not all dragon, just part dragon. sometimes, zombie! shoot mans, follow arrow! very excite. skyrim.",2
"awesome game with great graphics and the capability to play for hours with new paths always becoming avaliable to you. great mods for it as well!",1
"defeated alduin, world eater, and saved the whole of tamriel from a horrible fate, but now everybody hates me because i took two baked potatoes from an old woman. 11/10",1
"bearing down on 600 hours of this game, and its still a fun, fresh experience. skyrim was a substantial improvement over morrowind and oblivion. the races are all very viable choices for the game. while you lost the ability to customize spells from the previous game, you dont really miss them. crafting is a welcome addition to the game, as well. and eliminating the class system has substantially improved the game: no more having to powerlevel acrobatics, or becoming useless because you mastered athletics to the detriment of all skills. on the downside, there are a few weird bugs, but nothing terribly game-breaking. additionally, your inventory can get cluttered, probably because the inventory system was really designed for the console. not a big deal, just inconvenient. all in all, i highly recommend this game. if you like sandboxes, you will not be disappointed.",3
"fantastic game with endless possibilities, highly recommended.",1
"as casual and slimlimed as it is, its pretty awesome. shame its ended devolpement. 5/5",1
"this game is a great single player game. you can alter your challenge level based on your preferences, and go on to explore the world. i really like the direction that is given for quests, but if you dont want to quests they dont bug you about it.",1
"ive spent a whole lot of hours on this game, and its never managed to get old (even with the same quests!). highly recommended.",1
"it may be single player (for now), but it is hands down the best game out there, you may love racing games, fps or some crazy hentai stuff, you will always, however, come back to this game and play it some more even years later. if you dont have it - something is terribly wrong with you - fix it or have a talk with your family :)",1
"farengar secret-fire thought he was a boss, sending thugs after a vampire thief assassin. all was well for him besides the occassional feeding on him in his sleep (unbeknownst to him), until came the creation of a wizard. now, this was no ordinary wizard, it was a wizard of the undead variety known as a lich. as anyone can tell you, a lich is a being of pure hatred and despair, doing as he pleases with anything or anyone unlucky enough to cross paths with one. having heard of this wannabe wizard, the lich set his sights on the jarl of whiteruns home of dragonsreach. it was late that night when the lich hovered silently through the doors of the halls of dragonsreach sensing farengar nearby. he found farengar asleep in his bed, not knowing the terror that hovered over his slumbering form. the lich raised his hand as he awoke and tried fleeing in terror, but he knew there was no escape. the lich banished him to the realm of nightmares that changes itself with each lightning strike making it a worse existance than before, known as the realm of quagmire. he wont be sending thugs after anybody else. 10/10 would banish annoying wizard to nightmare dimension again.",1
"i spent almost my entire played time trying to see naked women. 12/10 will look at naked women again (not in real life, thats just weird)",1
"its skyrim. just leave it at that. go get some mods with it by the way.",1
"vikings. dragons. epic elder scrolls music. if i could see my feet when i looked down in first person i would most likely never play another game ever.",1
"just awesome! very nice atmosphere and a wonderful storyline.",1
"anybody that is an rpg fan will love this open ended adventure game. build and level your character around three different archtypes (warrior, mage, rogue) but no restrictions means you can mix and match as you please. the steam workshop mod support for this game is seamless and easy to use.",2
"420/69 you need to be truely mlg to play this game is warning if u ignore dis warn then loominarty will get yu omg",2
"400 hours between my son and i. so much to do and explore",2
"i cannot say enough aboutr this game, i love it! love the graphic, love the improved character skins... love the expansions. it is full of awesome sauce.",2
"great game if you dont get jump scares otherwise dont try you get so many scares but it is fun",1
"good fantasy game with a good main story but even if the main vases vases pib get tired you can do side quests like to join a guild to kill someone or zvate hunt for fun but now the game has bags like that you piece-figure bugno the rocks or that it will kill an animal but otherwise very good game! i recommend",1
"this game give you (almost) never ending experience",2
"pros: vast, vast world to explore dungeons and caves are wonderfully differentiated graphics and sound are for the most part incredible to behold cons: combat isnt very visceral, and victories and losses feel unearned menus and interface are terrible while the world is wide open, most quests and dungeons are very linear bugs abound, especially with physics i wont rant on about this game so heres a summary of it: while skyrim does almost nothing to address the weaknesses of its predecessors, it expands on the strengths to such an extent that even its most substantial flaws seem microscopic. you may not lose yourself in the unimaginative combat and story, but the world bethesda has created is so huge and so beautifully realized that you wont care.",1
"i bought this game last night for five dollars during the steam summer sale. i played for about half an hour, but after having some troubles with making the game full screen i went to bed. today at about eleven i decided to fix the issue and play for a couple of hours. after what i thought was a couple of great hours with the game i decided to exit out of the game and check the time. it was 4:30. needless to say this game is awesome. 10/10",1
"limitless entertainment thanks to the modding world. getting bored? pick new mod, change styles. better yet start all over, you think you might get bored but before you know it youll be traped again.",2
"10/10 bethesda makes another stellar game. if you enjoy exploring wide open, deeply immersive worlds with detailed lore, you owe it to yourself to own this game. also, the soundtrack is among the best ive ever heard. truly epic.",2
"where do i start....? amazing game wth amazing graphics and features. everything is easy to access and i love playing it.",1
"brilliant game, if you havent heard already skyrim and the full tes saga are something to get lost in i have had this before on console and have been a long term elder scrolls fan and i would highly recomend this to anyone looking to experiance a great rpg that they can lose hours of fun with! 10/10",1
"the best game ive ever played its like a never ending aventure",1
"this game is the ing . buy this game now, or i will come to your house and kill you.",1
"a game starting with a big g. magnificent masterpiece, that never let you get bored.",1
"i never was a fan of the elder scrolls games in the past. i was never attracted to them, i guess. but skyrim is different. its in a world of its own, literally. fluid gameplay, in-depth quests and side stories, and hours of content to enjoy. one of my best purchases since hopping on steam.",1
"i have only played 48 hours, but i have been continuously playing this game for a while. this is truly a great game!",2
"8 out of 9.69 it is very nice i like it when i kill the bandits with my sword and i say fus ro dah to the giants but but they fly away because i forgot to brush my teeth...",1
"this game made me forget about reality for a huge amount of time. there are so many things to discover, so many choices you can make that will somehow affect your character and theres tons of mods that you can add on to the game easily to spice up your game even more! i bought this game on its release day, and even up to today, im still not sick of playing it from time to time. in fact, i might just go play right now after i post this review....",2
"spent 10 hours trying to figure out what mod was crashing my game. 10/10",1
"after a great deal of time playing this game it is very apparent that it is a load of (was blinded by my love of the series), horrible magic system, boring hack hack hack combat and short questlines that leave alot to be desired. if you want a real elder scrolls game go play morrowind or oblivion.",2
"the long awaited 5th title for the elder scrolls is very much recommended",1
"this is easily goty. even if your not a fan of previous elder scrolls games id strongly recommend getting it. the best game ive played in years, and was successful in restoring my faith in the modern gaming industry. this game fukken ruwlzzzzz",2
"if you have played fallout 3 and liked it then be sure to purchase tes v skyrim",3
"there is over 100 hours worth of gameplay and you still havent completed this game! one of the best games of all time!",1

"i have sunken a wopping 100 hours into skyrim in the past two years, and aim to continue playing it even more. pick it up; your not likely to get another open roam rpg as good as this one!",1
"everything i loved about oblivion done better. side note: dragons are awesome.",1
"lots of fun with large number of gameplay hours of questing",2
"this game is amazing and have played it for over 100 hours. it is very indepth and will last you a long time. it is well worth the money if your computer can run it.",1
"skyrim is one of the best open world games of its time, the world feels alive, there is an endless amount of quests, and the gameplay is solid.",1
"o. maie. gaud. if tes: oblivion got upgraded with the latest in pc graphics drivers and increased the things you can do in said game by infinity, this would be the exact result! buy it now! (if ya have the cash, its over 30.00 dollars without the dlc for crying out loud, but worth every, freaking, penny.)",1
"you must buy skyrim to kill the dragons and to shout at the people it is very essential to do those things in your life because if you dont its youre stupid fault haha. (special sound like a teenager foreigner gamer day review).",1
"its pretty fun for an elder scrolls game but lets face it.......you probably bought it for the  mods...didnt you? it dosent live up to oblivion in the game itself, but still the ing mods are fantastic. overall if you like rpgs its worth a look.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim. is alot of fun plain and simpel, for anyone who loves to get lost in a world where you can walk for an hour without finding your self at the same place 2. it is a game where playing for a 100 hour is short. it had alot of bugs in the beginning but i only had a few over the now 300 + hours i have spent in this game, and with all the updates most of the bugs are gone. and for anyone who thinks this game dose not look good, there are alot of mods that make it look beter. this game is one of the best rpg out there a 9 out of 10 game.",2
"amazing game, best rpg ive played in a long time. unfortunately bethesda dont seem to be able to make a game without it including loads of bugs which really lets this game down. the game is perfectly playable, ive finished it a couple of times and when youre bored of the game you can install mods which is a big plus :)",1

"great sandbox game. really well made, it get me to wonderful place called skyrim. so im wandering there to gather wealth and skills. its really challenging. the best thing in game: music, skill system, dragons and much more. its worth all the penny. one thing i dont love is equipment interface. you can install mod to change it :) skyrim has lots of mods made by very talented people. my funniest memory of mod is macho dragon: changing dragon into macho with flaming breath. you can play it!",1
"i never thought that i would ever say this, but i have found a game (within this genre) that is better than fable ii. the world is huge, there are lots of quests, and there is a huge community of people who play this. the elder scrolls v: skyrim workshop contains almost too many mods, expanding the (already awesome) gameplay even further.",1
"yes! best medieval game! i love this game so much! i highly recommend for expierenced rpg players... for ones that want a level based game like thief i dont reccomend... if ur new to this type then i suggest u start out with greatswords/collect arrows/steal keys/steal/take/collect coins/ take potions and food. then after ur good try out fallout. its basically elder scrolls with guns and its retro nucular apocalypse and zombie-type, great game! u will love both games. i promise.",1

"absolutely the best adventure rpg out there! this game is open world and has lots of free will. go where you want when you want. want to do a quest or not, the choice is yours. slay dragons and save the people or become a thief or vampire. the graphics and world size are simply amazing. the setting is medieval with realistic design. the clothing, weapons, buildings and environments have a lot of detail. the music in this game is just addictive. its relaxing when youre just wandering around and gets upbeat and epic when battles start. you can download the soundtrack on itunes. one of the best things about his game is theres soooo much to do! ive been playing this game since it came out and im still playing with my original character. its like theres endless quests to do. if you like medieval adventure games youll love this game!",1
"fus ro da! this is the best game i have ever played! thousands of times better than any large scale mmorpg such as world of warcraft...the only thing this game is missing is a multiplayer system and this game is a perfect unbeatable one! hopefully when the elder scrolls online comes out...my hopes will come true...",1

"skyrim: the ultimate ginger simulator - steal souls to use them in your evil plans. ps. there are also dragons",1
"this is by far the best game i have ever played, and the sale on it made it worth the purchase.",1
"this game is still going strong since its release in 2011, especially when accompanied with user created mods. if you havent played skyrim by now, there is something wrong with you!",1
"one of the best rpgs ive played in a very very long time. play it any way you want. and add on different mods to add to the replay ability of the game. visit nexus mod manager. you will get to see what goodies you can add to your game!!! he he he ;) :d",2

"there are two camps when it comes to skyrim. camp one will install a bajillion mods to make this game into the elder s: s while the other will make endless jokes and references about something that was mildly funny.",1
"its okay. base game is boring. you can mod it. a lot. you can be the sexiest woman ever, and  bigger than the dragons themselves.",1
"goty 2011!!! this game is huge i already play it like 200 hours and didnt finish it just so many side quest! if you have skyrim use mods like the nude mod. ;)",1

"200 hours on xbox 360 over 180 on pc... and starting a new profile as a fully rp character that will add another 100+ hours... this game is amazing.",2
"this is like the elder scrolls: arena but with better graphics.",1
"its like the best rpg in the world at the moment, the world is vast with loads of quests. it is so good in many ways that, if i should write everything down here, you would ask me for a tl;dr. definetily worth buying, you wont need another game for weeksto come if you have this!",3
"a great rpg. the elder scrolls v is, first of all, a huge open world, where you can find everything from robbers of all stripes to the dragons. secondly, an interesting storyline and a lot of additional missions. thirdly, this is a good graphics, and great soundtrack. my opinion 10/10.",1
"not as good as morrowind, but very pretty, and the engine is fairly solid for modding. im pretty sure that is where bethesda focused its energy, such as with other titles like those in the fallout universe. 10/10 would avoid main quest and go straight to the theives guild.",1
"this game is bassically the golden mother-f***er of open world gaming. definrtly one of the greatest games of all time,",1
"amazing game. you can play it for hours and never get bored of it.",1
"skyrim is an open world role playing game. with tons of dungeons to venture through and tons of monsters to cut through. this game has got great graphics and shines with all the new skills. it has also got fantastic music. the gameplay is fast and the spells are awesome you can put on a skill in your left hand and another on your right. this applies to weapons to so you can dual wield. the dragons in this pop up at random any time and are fun to battle since they are not too hard nor too easy. once defeated a dragon will drop a soul which can be used for shouts another great thing about this game. it is a new and cool concept and was executed well. being a huge game (nearly 100+ hours) you would think it would have bugs or freeze but no it doesnt throughout the whole game it has never froze or nothing strange happened. i give this 10/10 a perfect game for anyone",1

"i havent fought many mudcrabs fiercer than this game.",1
"best game ever 10/10 definatly recommend this game to everyone i know i am little late on buying this game but it is really worth the money",1
"quite possibly one of the best games ive ever played. very nice as a standalone, and even better modded. this game is waiting to be molded into your image! what are you waiting for? buy this masterpiece already!",2
"a game that is quite enjoyable for the first 30 or so hours yet fizzles out eventually. at the current price it is worth a buy but its not as amazing and revolutionary as people say. with mods however, it can be one of the greatest fantasy games of all time.",1
"skyrim... an awesome game with many choices...no need to redo your character if you are fed up with beeing an archer...just start swinging a twohander and soon you will be as good. great stuff!",1
"its freaking skyrim! if you dont already have it you should feel ashamed of yourself...",1
"never thought that there would be a game who can excite me as much as the elder scrolls iv oblivion, but bethesda did it again and made a much more awesome game. the game is nice itself, but you can get the most beatuy out oft it with mods. and because of the skyrim community there are more than enough out there for it.",3
"the elder scrolls v is a amazing game, though not perfect, i had and still am having hours of fun playing it. i would give it a 9 out of 10",1
"still one of the best rpg games ever made. full of mysteries, quests and a f..ing epic story with dragons, and nords. simple skill/pers system, really good inventory, and stuff. even shouting someone from a cliff worth the money.",1
"the game is amazing!!!! i am recommending this game for everone.",1
"like the fallout games which preceded it, the execution of the open world environment is very well done. also less buggy than its predecessors. i really enjoyed exploring this world and the story.",1
"just absoulutly amazing if u want adventure this games got it swords got it bows and arrows got it mystical hights got it then this games for u it epic u should deffinitly get it now!!!",1

"an amazing game and works very well on all windows platforms.",1
"warning. you will lose your friends not get enough sleep forget eating cause. youll be busy making friends sleeping eating tons of cheese rolls and making your character ty as possible with mods. best game ever 10/10",1

"seriously who hasnt played skyrim its like, really good yeah",1
"amazing game beyond belief! you get to explore at your own pace with over a hundred side quests to do. you will be able to collect rare artifacts such as draedric weapons, armor, and jewelry! dominate your foes with the power of the dragonborn! slay dragons to steal their power and become the most powerful being in skyrim! become a werewolf/vampire and terrorize the pathetic mortals! decide the outcome of the civil war in skyrim by either joining the imperial legion or the stormcloak rebellion! you will decide the fate of skyrim!",1
"i yelled at a cow and it died, then punched a chicken and suddenly the entire town was trying to kill me, later i rode a horse off a cliff, killing the horse and i thought myself too until i stood up and brushed the dirt from my pants. after that, i punched a moose in the balls and it died, so that was a thing. then i fought a dragon that tokyo-drifted into the side of a cliff. afterward, i shouted at a goat and it fell down the mountain like something out of goat simulator. all in all, 12/10 would dickpunch livestock again.",1
"this game contains no lap dances, 420/69 would horse again.",1
"an absolutely gorgeous experience filled with adventure, exploration and dragons. a must have for any elder scrolls or fantasy medieval games. get it !",1
"ive never been intrigued by open world games. with the popularity of skyrim, i started to become very interested. 2 years after the release i purchased it for ps3 and was hooked instantly. upon getting a new laptop, i decided to buy the legendary collection here on steam and my oh my, i cant believe how much better the game is (i cant stress enough how easy it was to transfer my save file, i really have 40 hours of gameplay not 5!). the mods add endless content. if you are even the slightest interested in this game, i cannot recommend it enough. do yourself a favor and just get lost in this game.",1
"i think this may be my favorite game of all time because of the diversity in the game it may not have very many different classes but the way that you can live and the way that you level up is amazing. also the landscape is just so well done. the only thing that i would change is that you run into multiple people with the same voice. all in all this game is amazing and you should definitly purchase it.",1
"infinite dragons? check infinite quests? check orcs and giant spiders? check you can also punch a giant.",2
"great game, been playing it since it came out and still am playing it and when its gets a bit boring there is a great moding community to make it better",4
"take the elder scroll series and make it fun. you will not regret buying this epic game. you will know why you play it within the first five minutes. worth every cent spent on it. dont forget the expansions for it. you are going to want those too.",1
"dragons, shouting, magic, adventure!, fun, and did i mention dragons. skyrim is absolutely a blast, and once it wears down, theres always mods, including graphical ones that make it drop dead gorgeous.",1
"i am honestly just posting this review to get an acheviement but i decided to do it on this game so that saids a lot.",1
"if you like rpg games with never ending side quests this game is definitely for you, if you dont like it at all main story line took me about 25hours. summer sale for 2.45 totally worth it.",1
"if you have never played skyrim, you have never experienceed ife.",1
"the elder scrolls five ( skyrim ) is one of the most interesting, fun and enjoyable game i have ever played. as it was released in 2011 and still is better than todays games such as battlefield and call of duty and what not, skyrim was just very amusing to play. the thrill of slaying a dragon as it breathes fire/ice around you, the excitement of rushing into caves and slaying the undead or even turning into a werewolf and slaying all of the innocent civilians of whiterun. endless things to do in this game. i myself have completed the main story line as a imperial then khajit, completed the dark brotherhood, got all daedric items and still find new stuff to do everyday! seriously a must have. i will give it a 9/1o as it was a brilliant game and the best game of 2o11. ( giving it a 9 as it was not as good as the previous elder scrolls but you know, what is? )",1
"best part was when i chased down a forsken to find my horse had already chased her down and killed her!",1
"quite enjoyed this game. not much of a fan of oblivion, but this is certainly an improvement. this is my most played steam game to date.",1
"fun as . mod it to all hell, and the game is unbelieveably good.",1
"if you want a badass solo rpg game this is the one so much to do and so much not to do",1
"its skyrim, and on steam, you have access to workshop. i bought this game twice (ps3). never regretted it once. its amazing.",1
"this is a great game it has a great story line, lots of action, and hours of gameplay, one of the best ive ever played",1
"want to waste hours adventuring to far away lands, scaling mountains of content, and hunting to find the best treasured objects? oh no thats just the modding section of the game, i cant review the experience itsself.",1
"best game ive ever played this is a must for anyone rpg loving gamer",2
"ok, i have played this game through multiple times, and i have played more hours than steam shows because at first i was only playing it on the xbox 360. then i realized how much better the pc version of the game was! so since that realization i have been exploring the land of skyrim on pc only. now, on the pc you get access to extras like high resolution textures and many many mods. modding makes the game almost endless. so if you want a great looking game that is also a great playing game then i recommend skyrim. there is so much to do & different ways to do it each time, and its one of the games i return to when i get bored with the other 120+ games on my account.",2
"my wife left me, my dog left me, got fired from my job, stopped eating or going outside all thanks to this game. i can not explain how much of my life i invested into this game but man was it worth it! mods mods every where to make this game new again. sell your house sell your car sell your dog and your wife, all you need is this. 10/10 with more time over 3 diffrent platforms than i care to mention.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is my favourite rpg. i spent 200+ hours in this game beacuse its so awesome! pros: - graphics - amazing views and places - many weapons and armors - many spells and shouts - many quests and enemies - nice combat system - many classes to choose: mage, battle-mage, rouge, etc. - many character customizaton options - soundtrack - mods from steam community cons: - guards ffs - animals sometimes bugging i played on ps3 too and in my opinion its 10x better on pc buy it if you have the money!",1
"kkiiinnnggg ammmaaazzziiinnnggggg (i broke it with too many mods. fml.)",1
"a very fun rpg game would be a good idea for anyone who enjoys rpg style games to try out",2
"est combat in the world 0/10 i ing hate this game. to prove my hate for this game i am now going to cut my dogs  off.",1
"definately worthy of every penny! a must get for any rpg fan!!!",1
"holy molly! this game is by far one of the best games i have ever played in my entire life... this game is life... this game is love",2
"excellent sandbox rpg, worthy of spending many hours in. nice crafting system, except it doesnt have spell making, which is kinda sad, overall good fighting, and a multitude of mods to tweak the game, or pretty much make it something completelly different altogether.",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. endless hours lost in this action role-playing game! i highly recommend it to everyone i know!",1
"its one ofthe best only wish i could enchant like oblivion",2
"wow... this game is so much fun! i havnt played allt he other elder scrolls games but... i know i like this one... after you do everything such as : raid every dungeon... kill alduin... and kill the ebony warrior... it does get boring... but when you havnt done that yet... it is really satisfying when you kill a big boss or something... i recommend this game to other people that like action r.p.gs",3
"in my opinion the best game franchise ever created. the endless quests, and how the game seems to never get boring makes this my most played and favorite game ever.",1
"went into a cave, got in a fight with a vampire. 3 days later the whole world wanted to kill me. 10/10 would play again.",1
"working fine for the first few days i had it, now it refuses to stay open longer than bethesda logo, if i get it fixed ill be fine.",1
"this game is full of fun and hours of game play and it would be a horrible idea to not even give this game a chance",1
"one of my favorite games it can be improved further with dlcs and mods but the base game is still a lot of fun.",1
"i never came out of my room. my soul went into the game.",1
"i have played the game on consoles and pc, it is fanatastic. great story, immersive atmosphere and expansive world. if you looking for a fun adventure game to play on occasion, youll find yourself playing it once a day, for 24 hours. addicive and fun, definently in my top 3 favorite games.",1
"killed a chicken and now the whole town wants my head 10/10",1
"this is the best game of the year. awesome graphics, very interesting storyline and fun gameplay.",2
"first step, buy this game... then buy oblivion and then morrowind. the best game series, ive even seen ! great,but short story and great huge world ! great engine and more things. b 9/10 . its not the same game, this mean is not better than oblivion.",1
"skyrim is easy. easier than the other elder scrolls games. its my second favorite after morrowind. really, the only critique i can make is that i wish skyrim itself was more interesting. the country is alright as far as elder scrolls locations go, and lends itself to fun adventures. i mean, this game is really one big adventure simulator. but even with mods it fails to really capture my imagination, but i know thats wholly just me. for most other people its pretty rad and so more power to them. but yeah, buy the game.",1
"okay, i will give skyrim the obligatory recommendation. whats there to say? another sprawling bethesda epic. the only somewhat legitimate criticism ive seen about skyrim is regarding how bethesda tends to release games full of bugs thinking that users will come up with mod fixes. i dont know about that as i cant say ive ever played a bethesda title i considered broken. what i will say is that users in the steam workshop have come up with some truly incredible mods. deducting a point from bethesda is one way to look at it but i say giving people the freedom to use steam workshop gives them a point right back. the fact that it is a game so many people feel compelled to create so many mods for speaks volumes. bethesda must be doing something right.",1
"only xbox players 12 years of age and under may not think much of this game, but for the other billion of us who play it for its detail and immersion can approve. i highly recommend!",2
"seriously one of the best games in the last 5 years",2
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",1
"hello steam, i have a question to ask concerning skyrim. when i press the play button on steam and launch the game, it starts off fine and with only a slight amount of lag, but when i go to actually play the game, the screen is all mixed with the sky and land just stretched across the screen. this has been really annoying and i cant find a way to fix it. if you guys know whats going on or you know how to fix my problem, please e-mail me at nlittle2000@hotmail.ca because i know this is a great game and i would like to enjoy it just like all my friends do. ^.^ thx! ~exo~",1
"probably the best game ever made, and the pc version is even better because of all the mods. gods bless bethesda and all the folks that continue to make this game stand the test of time, and worth every penny!",2
"the best ever if your looking for a freerome,fantacy,game this is for you i rate it 100000000000000!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"the elder scrolls games are some of the best i have ever played.",1
"i would like to recommend this game to all my friends, epic graphics, great story, lots of side quests that will stray you from the main story! :d",1
"this is easily one of the most fun games i have ever played. you can easily put in hundreds of hours into this game. even though it was released in 2011, it still holds up today as one of the best free-roam rpgs i have ever played. there are so many different things to do from slaying vampires with the companions to assasinating people with the dark brotherhood to trespassing and pickpocketing with the thevies guild. and then when you think youve seen everything, you find out that the game has mods. you can slay orcs with the master sword then fight dragons that look like macho man randy savage. i love this game and i think everyone else should too.",1
"its a part of the elder scrolls <- do i have to add more to convince you?",1
"skyrim is love, skyrim is life. skyrim is a game that you can do anything, that you cant do in real life. like getting a girlfriend, getting married, slay a dragon, be king, and much more.",1
"this game is one of my favorite games, the mods add and endless supplie of thing to do and its just a great storie line",1
"although i am not much of a pc gamer, playing skyrim was one of the best decissions of my gaming career. a massive open world, so many choices, and some decent acting, as well as countless adventures that you can send your dragonborn on; what more could you ask for, dlc? well, skyrims got dlcs in spades. theres hearthfire, which allows for the adoption of children and the construction of 3 actual mansions that dot skyrims landscape. then theres dawnguard, which brings in a force of legendary vampire hunters and a group of true vampires. and finally, theres dragonborn, which takes across the seas, of the coast of morrowind, to the mysterious island of solstheim, which in itself, is a huge enigma. face countless enemies, find legendary treasures, and save tamriel from a rising terror, formed from legends and stories of heroes and brave warriors. are you of dragon blood, or are you a snibbling, whining milk drinker?! i give this game a 9.8/10, for shear creativity, decent acting, and such a broad world that you can explore. :d",1
"im just going to break this down into litte sections: graphics: outstanding! story: great. gameplay: awesome! dlc: i dont know, dont have any of the dlc",1
"sad theres no multiplayer, this game would have been so fun as even a coop! <-- not complaining just stating a fact. first off, i love skyrim, i played it constantly for xbox 360 . when i saw it on sale here i had to get it, and omg am i glad i did, frame rates = better, graphics = better, mod support = exists texture packs. shader packs. you name it, after playing this game side by side my xbox 360, it was aparent this one is 10,000 times better, the clarity on the pc on at 28 uhd 4k monitor was unreal and the xbox360 on a 60 1080p hdmi locked at 30 fps was terrible lmfao. -gameplay complaints- none apart from the moutain scaling and once and a while visual glitch accuring. 9/10 gameplay 10/10 modded gameplay standard 7/10 graphics modded 10/10 graphics sound 8/10 modded 10/10 i recommend anyone looking for a cheap , singleplayer game that isnt outdated and still offers plenty of content and even dlc if you really really love it.",1
"a great game with so much to explore, its fresh each time you play it. its worth picking up if you havent already! tamriel is waiting for your arival.",1
"this is a great game, packed with content, and is, and will always be my favorite game. i cant really write a review big enough to describe how awesome this game is, so i will try to stay short. this game has some of the best graphics i have eve seen, and is a very fun to play game. so, that is all i have to say (i would say more ofcourse).",1
"puts bucket on shopkeepers head hidden steals everything takes off bucket hello how are you today",1
"when ever i boot up skyrim it feels like you been away on a trip and your finally home again. i love it, and with mods its even more fantastic. fantastic!",1
"obviously not the pinnacle of role-playing that everyone makes it out to be, but what skyrim lacks in meaningful choices and character interactions, it more than makes up for with a rich, exploration-driven storyline rife with swords, sorcery, and dragons. the open nature of the skill system doesnt restrict you to any one class or combat type, and unlike other rpgs that have claimed the same in the past, skyrim makes this possible by simply leveling up those skills that you use, even once youve reached the hard character level cap. despite some technical shortcomings (mostly ironed out by now through game updates), skyrim offers one of the richest and most beautifully crafted worlds you will explore in your gaming career. i cannot recommend this game enough.",1
"the ultimate in detailed, open ended, amazingly addictive and mod supported rpgs",1
"this is the best action/rpg game out there! simply magnificent!",1
"far along in the game, im on a random bounty hunting mission to kill a random bandit chief. by this point, i have maxed out my stealth skill. so i quietly take out the bandit underlings inside the castle they use as their headquarters. floor by floor, room by room i am sniping them with arrows or shiving them in the back with a dagger. i feel like im tier one black ops. no one knows i am there until after they are dead. shhhhh, nighty-night. finally, i creep up to the top turret of the castle and i see my bounty standing there at the ramparts...with his back to me. he looks built to brawl, with his ebony armor. but he has not noticed me yet, as he stands there admiring the gorgeous view from the top... since i am coming up the stairs, i am eye-level with his feet. so i look up just a bit and hit fus ro dah. the angle i chose launched the bandit chief clear over the ramparts. he had enough hang-time for me to come out of hiding and watch him plummet screaming to the ground way down below and die on impact. that was when i decided to marry this game.",2
"its an awesome game!! i first pre-orderd it on ps3!!",1
"fallout ne- i mean skyrim is one of the greatest rpgs that ive ever played",1
"dont get this game if you want to have a life. very addictive.",1
"yummy graphics, totally up to you how the game runs, you can be who you want, look how you want to look, kill who you want to kill, and as always steal as much fruit and veg as you can fit down your pants :)",2
"its really laggy . the animation is okay if its not laggy",1
"i love playing skyrim it is a great gamewith a variety of quests it can get a bit laggy but overall is a brilliant game :)",1
"theres so much to do in this. i ended up getting engrossed in mining gold to make jewellry to level up my crafting skills.",2
"if you havent played this game already then well...i feel sorry for you.",2
"running around the countryside shouting is a great way to spend your time. if you dont want to do that then you can play skyrim, which is a very enjoyable game.",1
"a very deep and challenging adventure for certain.. only true gamers will appreciate. boosh!!",1
"skyrim is one of the best rpgs of all time! it has an unbelievable amount of replayablity and amazing quests that will keep you interested for a long time. so many different things you can do whether it be a faction quest to finding a daedric artifact to exploring ruins and caves and you name it. it truly is a never ending game and can be enjoyed by many for so many years to come. this is definately a game of the year and deserving of a 10/10. pick this up now, you wont regret it!",1
"quite simply one of the most immersive and playable games ive ever come across. 2 years after buying it, im still coming back to it over and over again. just a fantastic game and currently less than half the price i paid for it. get it!!",2
"yeah, if youre going to buy this, you might as well be ready to give your soul to it. for the amount of things you can do, the time you can spend, and enjoy about every moment while playing this game... it is very much worth your money. not to mention, dawnguard and dragonborn, some of the best add-ons ive ever seen, with hearthfire being alright. smiley face for happiness :)",1
"this is the best game i have ever played, i think. lol just buy the game. now!",1
"if you play this game or u are going to, you must head to workshot or nexus to waste you life! currently play it with 200+ mods and its so satisfying! the immersion,the sound, the art... everything will make you wooooow! and if you(actually you must) use mods as i said before, you can say goodbye to your life! 10/10",1
"skyrim is defenitely one of the best games ive ever played. the story, the awesome and big as hell open world, the way your actions have consequences, the almost infinite quests and all the awesome armor and weapons and other cool stuff you can find in this world is what makes this games almost perfect!",1
"this review probably wont change anybodys mind about this game, but its one of the few games that i believe to be closer to perfect than most. you can find lps, reviews, and mods out the wazzoo for skyrim, but i promise you that it is neither over-rated nor over-hyped. its approaching 3 years old, but it still holds up phenomenally well.",1
"theres an asston of things to do in this game, and what can i say that every other reviewer hasnt? the only problems id say comes with skyrim is an obsessive compulsion pertaining to keeping sets for little logical reason or make sure every item is in a set area. other than that, its excellent. id say you get the most thrill from being a thief, which has massive flexibility. i can feel good with two daggers and a bow waltzing straight into a fortress and slowly but surely wiping out every inch of enemy in sight with assassination via archery or my trusty daggers. or, choose to be a plate-wearing beserker/knight, even a mage. theres a ton of places to actually interact with and join, such as the thieves guild, college of winterhold, dark brotherhood and much more. its definitely worth it and, amazingly, is only 5gb. so dont expect to be installing skyrim for an absurd amount of time.",1
"amazing game, one to really get lost in with content and atmosphere.",1
"awesome open world game with adventure behind every tree. you could go wandering around randomly in the forests and then instantly stumble upon an ancient word of power, or an old tomb with riches to be had. i rate this game a solid 9/10 on graphics and storyline, however no bethesda game is without its glitches/bugs here and there.",1
"went on rampage, chopped off heads of everyone i saw, placed them on shelf at home. 10/10",1
"skyrim is a very nice and beautiful game on the highest settings with the highres pack also a very nice modding community expecally if you use the nexus community",1
"if you dont have this game, buy it. theres just no reason not to. simple as that. and i do mean buy, dont torrent!",2
"do you not have this game? stop waiting, go get it. stop asking questions, you will love it. (i had about 6000 hours on another account that i lost the password to. so i bought skyrim again. that should be point enough)",2
"one of my favourite action rpgs. though the main story line is weak, and only few choices really matter to the world, its still one of the most amazing rpg universes out there with a more realistic spin on tolkiens ideas and a few original races as well. one of the most supported games out there from the modding community, adding so much more to an already huge world. i would almost go as far as to say it must be played with at least some enhancement mods, though, as the graphics lack a certain atmosphere, and dark areas never really seem dark without proper lighting mods installed. ive spent 112 hours (as of writing this) and i still havent covered all the content and all the classes and race combinations yet. if you are an rpg enthusiast, i would most certainly recommend giving this game a go.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim review pros -awesome story -amazing modding community -immresive -so many things to see and do -lots of lore cons -can be very glitchy -default textures look kinda gross overall an amazing experience that everyone should have in their steam library. a must play! my score 9.5 out of 10",1
"downloaded so many mods i cant even remember what the original plot is supposed to be. 10/10 would help the people stop randy savage and thomas jefferson again.",1
"great game, very immersive, lots of things to do. do yourself a favor and avoid the actually storyline, though.",1
"a magical game. hundreds of hours of open world goodness, and workshop mods add a few more hundred. also love the huge amount of customisation.",1
"great game graphics 9/10 gameplay 10/10 weapons and armor 10000000/10 swag over 999999999999999999! and then mod so much and crash m8",1
"amazing rpg, extremely creative and its worth every cent!!!",1
"skyrim is amazing, plain and simple. with the workshop with it, you can pretty much do anything, very fun game",1
"this is the bes motta een geme i eva playd. mah as and i always sit around our piles of cokecane (an moonay) an play dis .",1
"stole some salmon from a old lady, she started to punch me even if i was dual wielding swords and rocking a bad  armor, seems legit. i lov ethis game.. 11/10 would play again and again, like im doing now..",1
"a must-have for all true warriors seeking great adventures! fusrodah",1
"i love this game becuase of its graphaics ,jk not really its a great game more when it gets glitchy and weird things happen",1
"one of the biggest, most in depth games ive ever played. deep backgroud lore, stunning visuals, capturing story. this game has it all. after 700 hours play time on my console, i was happy to purchase this game all over again for my beloved pc, and let me tell you i am beyond happy that i did. the amount of mods for this game is staggering, and after doing a complete visual overhaul, i fell in love with this game all over again. the amount of lore friendly created content (which at first assumed would take away from the amazing experience that is tesv) is incredible. just when you thought the game couldnt get any better... here goes another 700 hours of my life.",1
"having played over 200 hours of this b-e-a-utiful game, i can safely say it is one the best games i have ever played.",2
"with all the dlc you are goin to be busy for enternety (best english eva) and you can even add mods you can add like 300+ hours of gameplay to it by simply press the button subscribe",1
"the best rpg game ever created. i wish there was more dlcs.",1
"if you love rpg game and the freedom to do what you want this is the game for you! hundreds of quests to do and places to explore in the land of skyrim also there are good mods to extend play and add content eg, weapons, armour, quests and new races. one of my favourite games ever played over 250 hours on my 360 and had to buy it for pc.",1
"the elder scrolls skyrim ($59.99) - now heres a good game that you can basically do anything in, you can do quests, rank up, rank your abilites too become stronger in fighting,range, mage, alchemy, etc etc, skyrim is a never ending game that packs a punch at you, theirs alot to explore & alot too do. this game is on my top 10s list, its full of fun and alot of strategy.",1
"absolutely stunning on pc, a great immersive experience with many hours of gameplay to come.",1
"this is the best game ever you have to get it even you guy who thinks you will never play it even you.",1
"it is certainly true that skyrim is much, much better on the pc rather than on the consoles. why? 1 word. mods~ there are many, many, many, many mods all over the internet. besides, the gameplay is pretty good as well. as far as im concerned, this would be rated at a 9.75/10. its pretty good, but not my absolute favorite game. still, its good!",1
"the elder scrolls is definitely one of my absolute favorite game series of all time, and skyrim is a great addition to it. i bought this game pre-ordered for xbox 360 (11-11-11) and have continued to play it consistently for the almost 3 years its been out. having the game for pc only makes it better, with the incredible amount of mods available, and the ability to create your own. not much that can be said that the hundreds of others havent said. 10/10. 5 stars.",1
"the best game i have every played, worth a buy for sure! great mod community as well. the soundtrack takes the game to a whole new level. the in depth lore is amazing not only for the elder scrolls v but for all of the elder scrolls games.",1
"this game can live up to every expectation you would ever have, even if there are a few bugs and glitches, skyrim is probably the best open world game i have ever played, an open world where you can explore cities, dungeons and learn to use magick, all i can say is well done bethesda.",2
"great atmosphere, visually breathtaking, with a good music job, awesome experience... very good game.",1
"i originally had this game on my xbox, but my desire for mods made me use a laptop. skyrim is a fun game with lots of content. you maybe wondering wouldnt it get repatative doing the same quests each time you playthough the game?. well, thats where you are wrong friend. with the wonderful mods available on steam and the skyrim nexus, this maybe one of the few games that may never get old. each day new quests, cloths, and other additions are being added everyday to this wonderful game. i would highly recommend. many hours of this combined with my xbox hours have been wasted on this game .",2
"the funny, challenging, stimulating, entertaining and everlasting, first person (or third person if you prefer) fantasy open world role playing game everyone should play (and beat) at least once. not to mention the active and prolific modding community which is keeping the game up to date with impressive mods, able to push graphics, audio and gaming experience far beyond the original, already huge, capabilities of the vanilla game.",1
"this game is really great. lots and lots to do. if you enjoyed previous elder scrolls titles this will not disapoint. also has a great mod community and easy to install mods. if you are at all interested in an rpg, i reccomend this.",2
"10/10 amazing single player game! hours and hours of gameplay. simply a must have game!",1
"really fun to play, one of the best games available. the only downside is that the enemies level matches our level, so we could get in a situation where the game is impossible to beat. for example, a lvl 40 pure wizard is really powerful, but if you then level up melee or some other skills, your magic abilities are not more powerful, but the enemies are harder to beat.",1
"really great game with lots of depth and good voice acting. easily customizable with a load of mods to choose fromon the steam workshop.",2
"simply put, the best game ive ever played. cant get enough of it.",4
"2/5 just plain terrible boring and cliche. i mean does every dungeon need to have 400 draugres? why isnt there any enemy variety. plus the graphics are very lack luster. its all brown, everything is just a different shade of brown. do not buy this game",1
"ive never logged this much time on a single-player game before (700+ hours). i highly suggest playing this game, but be prepared to lose yourself for days on end in the mountains of skyrim.",3
"this game was one of the first i wanted to try out on my new pc and boy is it a good one. some minor gripes would be the glitchy map occasionally and the fact that your horse can die but that is all negated by the crisp, clean graphics and the gripping but sandboxy storyline. 9.5/10",1
"great game, a must have in your collection and definitely worth the money.",1
"its a good game, im only writing this review for a badge",1
"best open world game ever alongside fallout 3. pure fun.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is another great addition to the serie. it is everything a fan would expect. the story is incredible, the lenght of the game is awesome, you have plenty side-missions and you are left with a lot of different ways to play the game. the 2 main problems why this game doesnt deserve a 10 are the fact that the graphics are way out-dated, they look just like oblivion. it sucks that games nowadays are stuck having to develop with 5yo consoles. i think they shouldve done what bf3 did which is make the game on pc with ultra graphs possibilities and release an xbox/ps3 version which can run only at medium graphs. the second thing is the skill tree really isnt computer friendly, we can clearly see that it was made for console and it sucks. of course theres also a few minor bugs, but nothing that will ruin your gaming experience. overall this is a must buy for any rpg fans and even for people who never played any elder scrolls!",1
"this is my 3rd playthrough (with the first 2 being on xbox 360). playing on pc has opened me up to a ton of free mod content. its unlikely most of my steam library will get much attention for quite a while.",1
"i love this game. honestley the best elder scrolls game yet. the grapics? beautiful. the story? beautiful. the gameplay? majejestic. its all so perfect.",1
"i used to be the hero of skyrim, but then i accidentally killed a chicken... keep calm and fus ro dah",2
"to all of my friends, i am telling you to buy this game, its a good way to kill alot of time, alot of slow pace walking around and interacting but a pretty cool storyline, coulda been better but was pretty fun. there is so much you can do, its out standing.",1
"i dont like skyrim ( dont kill me ,-, ) 3/10 - would not scroll",1
"this game is fantastic. the world gives you so much to explore, experience and do that it can easily come off as boring simply because a player does not know where to start. if you take the time to adventure, this game will blow your mind.",1
"ive played all the elder scrolls games to date save for redguard. while this one is missing some features i liked a lot, id have to say that overall it is the best elder scrolls game to date. still finding new stuff after 500 hours!",2
"i went into this game with high hopes, ive heard good things, ive heard bad things, but i finally decided to get my own opinion about it. after about 35h playtime ive come to a conclusion. this game isnt that great. before you  yourself let me explain, ive explored almost the entire continent, gone into every cave, ruin, and mine i came across, even attempted some of the quests, but basically the only thing this game has going for it is the decent looking environment, thats it. exploration was fun for that 35 hours, but then i realized something, this game has some boring  quests. nothing at all in comparison to morrowind, and especially nothing in comparison to oblivion, which had some pretty incredible quests, this installment was just a disappointment. i wanted to like it, but you cant really force yourself to like something that is just 85% poorly designed. i recommend any aspirant buyers to wait until it is very low in price, or pirate it, i dont give a , just dont pay full price for this mediocre bethesda title.",1
"skyrim is an adventerous and entertaining open-world game that gives you the freedom to make your own choices and lets you create your own path through the skyrim world. highly recommened game!",1
"i havent seen the light of day in at least a week, please help me... but anyway, skyrim is a very fun and detailed game where you play the role as the dragonborn, and must save skyrim from alduin, a power-hungry dragon that wishes to destroy the world. the combat mechanics are quite good, although glitches are prevalent. its a very good game, and id reccommend it all the way.",1
"skyrim feels and plays very similar to oblivion, the previous game in the elder scrolls series. that said, the graphics have improved a lot and the land of skyrim is very different from cyrodiil. most of the continent is covered in snow and ice, with heavy snow storms not being an uncommon phenomenon. many times while travelling through skyrim on horseback, i actually felt cold and wanted to grab a blanket to wrap myself in. i was a lot more invested in the main questline of skyrim than i ever was for oblivion. ive always liked dragons, and skyrims main quest has no shortage of them. however, its easy to put 100 hours into this game without even touching the main quest. indeed - in typical elder scrolls style, skyrim is very long and its practically impossible to complete every quest in the game. its easy to spend entire days playing without noticing the time passing by. this is one of the best games out there for fans of open world rpgs.",1
". bethesda just leaves tons of bugs and releases dlcs that conflict with the base game. leaves fixing their  game to the modders.",2
"the best adventure rpg there is! if you dont have this game, il fus ro dah yo",2
"amazing game! despite the fact its over 3 years old, its still being played heavily these days. i love this game to death (this is the second copy i own, first was on xbox 360) the possibilities are endless, youll easily find yourself playing this game well over 100 hours. i cant wait for bethesda to release the elder scrolls vi! (march 2016, rumours)",1
"a tremendous masterpiece! best single-player game ive ever played; often gives me the creeps. *thumbsup*",1
"you all know what skyrim is just pay the money, get the game, and have fun!",1
"10/10 love to play this game theres just so much to do i never get bord",1
"very amaizing 11/10 was addicted for weeks crazy fun game.",1
"a gaming experience that offers a variety of enjoyable playthroughs and a character development system (perks, guardian stones, etc.) that lets you play without as much of a hinderance on playstyle as many other games would seem to enforce, while keeping the door cracked open for interchangeable playstyles without being overly forced to make a new character to play as you want.",4
"an amazing open world game with much to offer and endless amounts of entertainment.",1
"skyrim, the finest elder scrolls game to date. you can go anywhere, do (almost) anything, whenever you feel like it.. caves, dungeons, tombs, lairs.. so much to discover, with multitude of enemies to vanquish. be a fighter, mage, thief.. or maybe a sneaky hybrid, a caster who uses illusion spells and strikes from the shadows.. an archer who is not afraid to wade into melee range when needed.. all paths are very much viable. if you are a fan of roleplaying games, skyrim will keep you entertained for countless hours as there is always something to do, some new place to discover, some new loot to find.. and thanks to mods, all that is multiplied, making the game a worthy purchase indeed!",2
"11/10 hands down one of the best games i have ever played. it is a fun mix of rpg, battle, and magic. i would definetly reccomend this without doubt, this game is worth twice the cost and money.",1
"love this game, probably my favorite game of all time.",1
"if you liiked elder scrolls iv : oblivion youll like this plus you get the addition of dragons! great looking game but a bit of a grnd and youll likely find yourself looking for the cheat codes after a few days of hacking through the same 20 feet of map. its becoming a cult classic and frequently in the top 5 most active games on steam. just remember, its a bethesda game so expect a lot of dialog trees, walking (like a hobbit), and puzzles along the way.",1
"apparently i just wasted $60 because i wasnt aware of the myriad mouse problems that bethesda hasnt bothered to fix in over three years. also found out that steam doesnt do refunds. youre welcome for my money bethesda. youll never get another dime from me. they never should have released this game in this broken state, especially with a lazy, money-grabbing developer that refuses to fix the real problems.",1
"this game is just fantastic! had it for the xbox, ps3 and pc and just love the game. scenario of the game is breath taking and the quests are full of excitement. also putting mods into the game is a great idea for just that extra boost to the game and makes it even better. i have played in the beta of the elder scrolls online and i can say i will be purchasing that whenever i can and playing if for hours :)",1
"simply the best-realised open-world game ever created. if only i could work out where all the calipers have gone...",2
"good game - fairly good graphics and free worldly (no that is not a word,) - combat is a bit same-same , but i have only played for a few hours. - [7.6/10]",1
"very long game, filled with content. worth the money in terms of hours per dollar. extreme amount of mods to further improve experience.",1
".. its amazing.. but i bought it the other day for the legendary edition for $40.. and now its on sale for $14...",1
"skyrim is great! its super easy to lose your self in the amazing world and designs!",1
"i have put soo many hours into the xbox 360 edition of this game and lucking forward to doing the same on my pc",1
"the best game hundred of hundred hours to entertainment, really captivating, complex with dozens of mods and dlc to expand an already massive world",1
"fus ro dah. dis gaem to gud. to gud. can explore lot of stueff and keel ppl and get magic and keel more ppl and dragns. 10/10. gud grafics and gaemplay",1
"whats to say, its skyrim. if you like open world rpgs, killing dragons, and/or being a punchcat, its the game for you.",1
"this is one of my favorite games of all times. the fact that it is open world is amazing, and the character developement is so much fun! i love the voice acting, and the quests. it keeps you busy for sooooo long! and the best part honestly is all of the silly bugs! skyrim has the best glitches ever. xd",2
"skyrim is not just a game, its a whole world in your hands! the story is just crazy, side quests are great! you can become a great warrior, or be a regular family man, the choice is yours, but know the world of skyrim is great friend of mine and he is waiting for you!",1
"kinda boring.. only paid ten bucks for it though. this game is for some one who is really really bored.",1
"hey there honestly i loved this game on the ps3 when i had it, and i recently brought it for pc but no matter what i try whenever i start a new game there is now charecter interactions and if you keep ridding the cart you get to helga and nothing happens?? :p, has anyone encounted this bug? :p",1
"this game is enormous, with so many things to do and see. beautiful visuals, some excellent mods... it still keeps me captivated years after its release. my only gripe is that your actions in the world feel meaningless to the world itself... but yet i still come back to it.",2
"it is one of the best games i have ever played i would massivley reccomend it to anybody",1
"best modding experience out there, even if youre new to it its simple. beautiful game.",1
"great game! i cant stop losing hours in this. this game will take over your life, but will grant you a pretty sweet one in return:d",2
"skyrim is the second most yelling focused game that i own behind dota 2.",1
"used to have a girlfriend... now i have a pet dragon!",1
"excellent game. vivid environments, cool magic effects. fun combat. interesting lore. cons: several known glitches not corrected. no major ones, but some annoying minor ones. character creation differences are minimal. would be nice if the various character types had more visible differences. overall a+ with great replayability and awesome gameplay.",2
"one of the few aaa titles that wont disappoint this year.",1
"great game in the legendary the elder scrolls- series. lots and lots of content plus (in classic bethesda style) infinite amount of player created mods and active community. only minus i could find was the legendary edition patch. somehow that made me lose interest for a while.",2
"the combat system is sub par. the game in vanilla is a solid 7/10. theres a lot of quests, but most of them is go from a to b type of quests where you might kill some things along the way. this wouldnt be a problem if the combat system was more fleshed out. luckily theres some really good mods that gives the game some spice. 7/10 vanilla 8/10 with mods 9/10 with rice",1
"a great fun game with lots of content. its awesome.",1
"if you havent played it yet, you have lived under a rock all your life. 10/10 ign approved",1
"this game is absolutly brilliant i recomend to anyone that has a sense of adventure. this game ratedd 10/10",1
"the gold standard of first-person rpgs delivers again. excellent story, many side quests, solid controls, and excellent audio/visual presentation all combine to make a good experience. many sidequests, combined with the plethora of mods available, this game has the potential to be played for thousands of hours. the only drawbacks are the same ones that have plagued the series since morrowind: same-looking (and sounding) npcs and needless character customization options. these drawbacks are easily overlooked, as the experience is immersive enough to draw attention away from them.",1
"this game is one of the best ive played in a very long time. the content in this game is so massive that you will probably end up playing over 200+hrs if you want to complete all the quests. 5 out of 5 stars!!",1
"this will be game of the year. i havent played an rpg this good in many years an this game is everything that playing a game should be. if you played oblivion at all this is oblivion x 10. unbelievably good game here.",1
"this game is so good, it should be mandatory. its just unending fun.",2
"if you like to play a great for hours and still find new things, play this game. you will never get bored and you get to kill some mother fu*king dragons",1
"the elder scrolls universe reaches its pinnacle, again! taking all your favorite lore from morrowind and oblivion, and continuing on into the future: skyrim is an open world adventure with so much to do, you can easily find yourself spending days played without actually progressing the main story arc. replay, for me is a must in any game, and the elder scrolls series never fails to deliver!! 99.99999999999 out of 100. if you love action/adventure/rpgs and havent tried skyrim, youre doing yourself a horrible disservice!",1
"easily the best rpg ive ever played. if you like decapitating bandits while running away from dragons, then this game is for you.",1
"this is my 3rd copy of skyrim, ive bought the original for the playstation 3, then the game of the year edition for it. now ive owned it for pc for a while and i love the modding community! it does take away from the game, knowing if you ever get in a harsh battle that you can just type tgm and go charles manson on everyone, but the upscaling of the graphics, updated textures (free dlc), and the insane amount of mods make this port a show stopper.",1
"the best game ever i ready hope you buy this game 100 stars",1
"one of the best rpg games and able to play your character however you want is great. ive made a tanky type of character and the archer style light gear with a bow. lots of fun even after it has been out this long its well worth it of a game.",1
"omg, if you havent played this game, then you dont know what your missing....",1
"so beautiful.. ;-; an epic adventure for sure.. then come mods.. sweet juicy never ending mods t~t 9,000/10!",1
"the game is pretty fun and addictive, although it is let down quite a lot by all the glitches and amount of unfinished parts.",1
"ui but install a mod to fix it and youll be okay.",1
"literally the best game on steam you can do whatever you want. (even turn alduin into a sweetroll and eat him.) and the modding community is so big the fun will never end.",1
"i so so love this game, got so into it. love the fact you control what happens with your char.",1
"after getting every achievement, i still cant put this game down.",1
"why dont you have this game already? there is tons of stuff to do and with content being added to the workshop everyday, there is limitless content, and if you enjoy fantasy games, this is the perfect game for you.",1
"i never was so elder scrolls fan but i tried game jus blow my mind game is so epic! 10/10",1
"this game is truly amazing! the story and lore are very rich in content and has been well developed. at every turn i find amazing views and more enemies to fight, leveling my character to get amazing powers and abilities along the way. this game is a truly rich and fulfilling experience, and is worth every penny!",1
"-10/10 i enjoy modding this game but i do not enjoy playing it because it keeps crashing lmao",1
"more people need to hear about this indie game. its a real joy to play and a real joy to play. i loved playing it, it was a joy. i had a joyful time and was filled with joy when i heard they were making a sequel.",1
"this game is so great, i love exploring and level systems so everything have a level... and i love skill branches... i love it, sob. in skyrim you dont have to follow the main quest if you want (but eeeh its neccessary) and i just... its so fun to just go around and see what youll find. one time i was in riverwood, and a dragon appeared just like that. and i paniced i was like ,  that i cant deal with a dragon right now. and i went into the inn... and the music was still playing, but muffled. and then i was like fine okay if the music keeps on playing and puts its ing belief in me then okay... ill do it. and i went out and the dragon was gone and everyone was dead. i looted everything, and got too much . and many times ive gone to kill a dragon, finding myself run away to a giant so the giant can kill the dragon instead. good times. i think a lot of people can find fun in this game, it has so much stuff in it. just... buy it.",1
"ive played almost nothing since getting this game. this game gets you to play it....alot. send halp...actually no dont, having too much fun.",3
"spawned 50 braiths. shouted them off a cliff. 10/10",1
"i bought the game, and 6 hours later i cant play it because it crashes whenever i load a character...waste of money",1
"i love the elder scrolls series, and this game only adds to the lore, contunuing old information, but in a way that newcomers can also play the game and enjoy it.",1
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played!",1
"possibly the best game ever made, a million things to do, a million ways to do it, enourmous open world. no rigid class system, train the skills you want and use. and a vast array of mods when you get bored of the status quo. and dragons.",1
"if you dont get skyrim i will find you beat you to death with a pole and burn your dead corpse with a flamethrower then use a chainsaw to grind your guts into giblets and then i will feed the giblets to hungry sharks",1
"incredible breadth but a serious lack of depth. skyrim is a land for exploring, but not so great for digging into. you really have to make your own fun once youve gotten the hang of the dead simple gameplay. dragons are more annoying than anything. can you tell how much time i spent playing oblivion? i wish this were just oblivion 2, cyrodil with a facelift and a massive amount of new deeper crafting systems and dungeons.",1
"im not sure how mere words could possibly form a summation for my adoration and the enjoyment ive found in skyrim. this game had provided me with a plethora of fond memories from my adventures in the snowy province. with countless quests and interactions, theres hardly a dull moment in the robust life of a dovahkiin. now, of course theres the occasional bugs and glitches. i wont deny that ive experienced my fair share of these, all varying from amusing, annoying, and/or frustrating. but thats an incredibly meager price to pay for the vast immersion i recieved when i was dropped into the culturally rich, lore-filled world of nirn once again. truly, theres something in skyrim for everyone. even when the gameplay ceased to amuse me, the world and its people continues to enthrall me. im no stranger to tamriel, and i intend to stay here for a long, long time.",1
"love this game! there is too much to do sometimes. ive spent so much time on all the side quests, ive barely touched the main questline. :p",1
"bethesda continues to thrive with this kind of game. ive been hooked on their gameplay since fallout 3 and skyrim is by far their best work thusfar. you cant ask for a bigger landscape to explore, and characters/weapons are just as detailed as the world around them. quests are very fun to do, and the storyline (if you sit through all the talking) is very well executed. the dlc is also a must, it adds so many fun features that you dont get with the regular game, so i do recommend getting goty edition.",1
"if you dont already own this game, your parents should disown you. just buy it now, ill forgive you.",1
"still a great game to play even 3 years later. the open world makes for an exhaustive amount of play time.",1
"this game consumed 512 hrs of my life.. until i got an arrow in my knee... :)",3
"i cant stop playing this game. please, make me stop. it is consuming my life.",1
"kill dragons! kill women, farmers, horses, foxes, trolls, vermin and undead chickens! then chat a bit to people before chopping off their heads and shouting so loudly that you send people flying off castle walls. you can do all this and more in a game that only gets tiresome once youve realised its actually very limited in what you can do, which is mostly the afforementioned killing stuff thing. but for a while it is incredible. off with their heads!",1
"dont buy if you want to do well in school, keep a good social life, have good friends, and keep in touch with family. 10/10",1
"elder scrolls skyrim... probably one of the most anticipated titles in a long time... everyone wanted a peice of this game.. it spawned numerous internet memes but all of that aside, its truely a great great game. the graphics are breathtaking, the combat is amazingly indepth and fun, the quests and storylines are moving and incorperate you in ways you didnt think possible. i could go on for hours about the gameplay but there are thousands of reviews about how great this game is... ill sum it all up on one sentance for you. bethesda has done it again... its just amazing, you must play this game. (fps / rpg / adventure)",1
"fus ro da! this is the best game i have ever played! thousands of times better than any large scale mmorpg such as world of warcraft...the only thing this game is missing is a multiplayer system and this game is a perfect unbeatable one! hopefully when the elder scrolls online comes out...my hopes will come true...",1
"this has to be one of the greatest games on steam, ive completed it a long time ago on my ps3 butt still but the pc version. and i cant get enough!",1
"this game is just awesome. it has big open world, tons of quests. with mods it gets even better!",1
"skyrim is one of my top favorite games. this game is huge and full of content infact is has so much content i still havent found everything in the game and i have about 200 hours of play time. this game also has a huge modding community so you basicaly cant run out of content there is always new mods to make the game look better and add more creatures to fight.",4
"i love this game! for anyone who likes exploring games or dungeon crawlers this game is perfect. admittedly after a while some of the missions can get a bit same-y, but this is easily fixed with many many mods. one of the best games ive ever played: 9/10 without mods. 10/10 with mods",1
"ive played this for over 600 hours... doesnt that say it all? immersive, huge and stunningly beautiful, skyrim is one of the great crpgs available. while its individual quests and characters may not be memorable, the sheer expanse of the gameworld more than makes up for the lack. and with the addition of user-made mods and add-ons, the adventure never needs to end.",3
"a well-known rpg, everyone knows about it for a damn good reason.",1
"realy cool, but its realy expensive in a quick summary. but if you like a more extensive recconmendation: +workshop so you dont get bored +exelent back story +good video quality choices -very expensive dlc, but can be worth it sometimes during holidays. +very long story line so you dont beat in a day. - save selections sucks since you have to find which ones which thats realy all i can name since i havent gotten to far in the game and ive played 52hrs xd",1
"this game is best played shirtless with a giant flagon of mead in hand.",2
"this is one of the best rpg games of all time, you never run out of things to do and the graphics are still good years later.",1
"awesome dragon slaying action, and many more. lots of skills to level up outside of combat, which i definitely enjoyed (such as mining and smithing, alchemy, enchanting). the game has the most solid replayability potential of any game ive ever played. 10/10.",1
"as an avid elder scrolls fan, i would recommend this game to anyone who has enjoyed previous installations, as well as newcomers to the series. personal playstyle is rewarded in-game, and there are different factions to choose from for just about any kind of game play. like stealth killing enemies from range, or up close? check. laying magic traps, and then blasting your foes with lightning, frost, and fire? check. how about the good old fashioned smash em in the face with a big axe? naturally check.",1
"you ought to love this game and its beautiful graphics. the story is complex and interesting. the journey pulls you into this gorgeous world of dragons and mythical creatures. moreover, the landscape is simply breathtaking!!",1
"when people say you dont know who i am they are definitely referring to this game.",1
"all consuming fantasy adventure. i keep coming back to this despite having put hundreds of hours in to various versions.",1
"skyrim is by far my favourite game of all time, tons of hours and more is to be had playing this. i recommend skyrim to anyone who likes a great open world rpg with strong lore, or anyone to be exact!",1
"a dragon got kill stealed from me by a crab. 10/10",1
"i extremely recommend this superior elder scrolls game to anyone who loves rpgs. this game has so many quests, dungeons, great graphics, cool storyline, and addicting. just when you thought youve finished the game, nope, theres still adventure out there in the huge map of skyrim.",1
"i used to be a real person like you... then i took skyrim to my life... 8.5/10! :d",1
"i dont know what i could add to all the reviews that have already been done. terrific game with lots of options on how you want to play. definate improvements over the last title as well.",1
"skyrim is a fantastic games. things i like: i am a rather busy person and by big issue with some games i play like wow, guildwars(1 & 2), is to play those and get anything out of it i have to set a large chunk of time aside. with skyrim i can hope on, play for 15-30 minutes then go back to whatever else i need to do. dlcs: having exandable game content is a great way to keep a game intesting. availability on steam workshop: having an easy source to add graphic packs and everything else the workshop has really increases the game experience. this also allows people with system that can handle the game itself enjoy the game while allowing others with beefier systems the ability to really make it awesome. things i dont like: <this space intentionally left blank>",2
"one of the best games ever even now with next gen console games and other aaa title it still holds its own in every aspect",1
"one of the greatist games that will last in years to come :)",1
"awsome game got addicted to it but then bored as you would but a 10/10 game!!!!",1
"i am a big fan of this type of game. plundering dungeons, killing enemies, selling loot all in the search of epic items and gear. character customisation alters the way the game is played as different npc react differently to certain races/sexes. some of the side quests are extremely long and the pay off is nowhere near adequate. the main story is long enough to ensure you can max out your characters skill level, and the oponents level with you so you always find a challenge. i recommend this game to anyone who is ditching wow and looking for something similar.",1
"oh my god guys, this game, oh my god....if you have a life, swap it for skyrim.",1
"saved the world from dragons then got killed for shouting at a chicken 10/10",1
"thig game never ends, has huge replayability, and if you think you saw everything, thats where mods come in , a pro tip though: be very careful with mods i highily recommend you take only very well endorsed mods, and read everything about their compataility and the load order, if you want the game to roll with no problems.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best single rpgs of its generation. the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is fluid and unique, the world is huge, there are hundreds of quests to keep you busy, and thousands of beasts to slay! plus, theres dragons! freaking dragons! what more could you want in a game?",1
"easily one of the greatest rpg games of recent times. i highly recommend playing this if, for some ungodly reason, youve yet to do so.",1
"great open world rpg, super easy to lose many hours playing this game. well worth the price whether it is on sale or not.",1
"best rpg ive played to date. there is nothing else like it out there. the leveling system is my favorite of all the games ive played because of its intuitive leveling-by-practicing functionality. extremely fun to play with hundreds of hours of content and replay potential.",2
"this game made me shout fus-ro-dah in real life to see if it would work; unfortunately, it didnt. but, i found the game immersive and a lot of fun and i got that going for me which is nice. 11/10",1
"this is one of the best games in my steam library, and i have some pretty good games. lets get the worst out of the way first. (theres not much) it can get a little repetitive when it comes to dungen raiding, but thats only if you never change your play style. some of the animations are a little sketchy, but thats only compared to todays games. now that thats out of the way, lets get to the good stuff. this game is amazing. the world is huge and has so many places for you to explore. its got all of the things you need to rp if thats your style. (inns, carriges, fancy clothes, random items, ect.) it is a full on rpg with a skill tree for everything you could think of. (pickpocketing, lockpicking, archery, 2 handed, 1 handed, being a god**mn werewolf, ect.) its got so many quests that you probibly wont ever find them all without using a guide. the playtime on this game is the longest on any game i have ever played excluding mmos. it seems the only thing this game is missing is online multiplayer. if all of that is not enough for you, there is also a huge selection of mods in the steam workshop for you to add to your game and make it even more extensive. there is everything from lord of the rings weapons to flaming horses to thomas the train dragons in the workshop. what are you waiting for!? buy this game! 10/10 would write a super long review again.",1
"a must have title for your steam library. 100+ hrs game time into this title and still nowhere near finished. recommend this game to anyone.",1
"no doubt the best bethesda has every released. an absoute must buy for any elder scrolls fan.",1
"very immersive game by default, and expandable via the workshop adding even more gameplay possibilities at no cost. unfortunately, the bridge cost between the standard edition and the legendary edition is too far out of balance with just purchasing the dlc components base game: 34.99 au legendary: 49.99 au (includes all dlc) dlc 1: 24.99 au dlc 2: 6.49 au dlc 3: 24.99 au = s56.47 au for just the dlc, let alone the cost of the base game, which was double the price at launch. buying the legendary edition of the game is ridiculous to get the dlc at a cheaper cost than actually buying the dlc...and its not even cheap.",1
"bethesda obviously wanted to make skyrim the more accessible game of the series, so they went and streamlined it. streamlining is good, to be sure, but they did an amateur butcher job and cut away some of the meat along with the fat. apart from your skills, there are no stats, when you level up you can put ten points into a resource bar of your choice and spend a perk point on a tree to beef it up a bit. have fun with that. while it also looks nicer than the other tes games, its all plastic surgery; a nice illusion placed over a missing heart. skyrim isnt written as oblivion or morrowind, the characters are less interesting, and so are the cities, unless youre just in it for the same old cliched fantasy designs. im not telling anybody anything new here; skyrim is an old game now and everybody knows whether they love it or they hate it, im just putting my two cents forward and hoping that tes vi be a more interesting game than its pedeccesor.",1
"quite possibly my favorite video game ever. good main story, awesome gameplay and a huge and beautiful environment. if you like desintegrating people using flames, then this is your game. in over 120 hrs worth of gameplay and still have dlc to play and undiscovered locations to find. 10/10",1
"the game that is much more lifestealing than dota 2. 11/10.",1
"played this game till i encountered the massive spiders, only  once. 10/10",1
"i have put well over 1000 hours into this game having had it on ps3 and maxing out with lvl 83 before i got it on pc, but this game never....ever gets old, there is just so much to do and i keep discovering more lore and quest and hidden things on the on the map and in the game, this is the best purchase and the best game i hav ever played in my entire life, and i started from day one (nov 11th 2011 on ps3) on this game, and hav never stopped and just looking back on when i sucked, to what i am now, makes me laugh, and remembering the great times i had doing all the quest and add ons makes this game great!",2
"its an ok game i would not buy it when it was $40.00",1
"this game is so much better on pc then it is on ps3 i love it",1
"the most amazing epic fantasy adventure with some bugs and some annoying things ... but who cares. :p i never ever played something like this. (except oblivion but skyrim is more beautiful than that xd) huge world, exciting quests and unlimited gameplay with mods. recommended to try playing without them and highly recommended try as many as you can ... that is another dimension of the game. a deep ,captivating dimension of skyrim. :) without mods : 98% with mods : 200%",1
"ing awesome. and one big time sink. get ready to give up your life. even the bugs are entertaining.",1
"well i dont have near enough time on here as i do on the xbox but im super excited to try out the mods. i can easily say that skyrim is one of the best rpgs around.",1
"a wonderful game and a true testament to the elder scrolls series. not as big as my beloved daggerfall or arena, but complete immersion into the environment is still possible. an easy to use skill system (though i do miss the in-depth ones of old) and a great character generation system make the game easy to play your way. above all i love the customizability of the game itself, leaving it to the end-user to shape the game as they see fit. a great and immersive set of stories to go through, with dlc expanding it to many hours of enjoyable fun. this is by far one of the greatest games that i have ever played, and continue to play!",1
"awesome standalone, but mods can bring it to a whole new level as well. can be tasking to a pc when heavily moded, but worth the trouble. bethesda also delivers the deep story line that they always do.",1
"some serious replay value here. one of the best games of recent years/memory.",2
"epic role play game with tons of bugs and outdated system. i still cant figure that out why this game is so popular (even among normal players), because with those defects, this game should only be a fans-only game. the only perfect part that i cant complain about is the scenes. i believe there are no game scenes can be more immersive than skyrim. recommend to any the elder scrolls fans, rpg maniacs, modders and players who interested in making a perfect rpg by adding mods to a semi-finished rubbish.",1
"if this was a sweetroll it would be a good sweetroll",1
"bland combat and factions, a beautiful world to explore, large amounts of customization, and a huge modding community.",1
"i threw a guy off the top of a mountain by shouting at him 15/10",1
"i keep trying to quit you, but you keep pulling me back in.",2
"this game is great. ive spent hours adventuring in the land of skyrim.",1
"dawnguard could be pretty cool, but its not. i cant get to my freaking house without getting f***** by daywalking vampires. high res dlc is crap (insane amount of stuttering all the time), get the hd texture mod instead. overall, nice amount of content, crippled by the incompetence that is bethesda. agree with me or not, but its true.",1
"i guess you could say i would like to make babies with this game.",1
"this is by far the best game ive ever played. just when you think youre done, you get pulled back in. mabye i should play a mage, or a warrior, or a thief. the lore is so expansive you just get lost in it, even now im just barely grasping the big picture of it. youre adventure as the dovahkiin (or not) will go on forever. the mods are so much fun, they add upon everything, from quests to cities to followers and armors there is a mod for it. 20/10 would ruin my life again.",2
"feel the epic sensation in the way of the thuum as you play dovahkiin in probably the best rpg today tes:v skyrim!! fus-ro-dah",2
"my first rpg and i have had so much fun with it. workshop makes the game personal and even better.",1
"elder scrolls games just make you feel like your an adventurer in a different world.",1
"wanna hack and slash and conquer the world, well you can in this game with the help of mods that make your gameing expeirence amazing! cast spells, make weapons enchant them, improve them, shower your enimies from afar with arrows, or sneak behind them in the shadows and eliminate them with one swift attack, battle bandits, trolls, dwarven contraptions, necromancer all the fantasy enemies and of course your favorite enemy the dragon, out of no where of wings of black, blasting balls of fire, streams of ice, even lightning. with your own path to walk its your choice to become the hero, if not the most feared villian of all time. this is now your world for you are dovahkiin, dragon born!",1
"most immersive and content rich game on the market today. definately better than having a girlfriend, and cheaper too.",2
"this game is amazing! 10/10 skyrim is so amazing that ive nearly played 75 hours and im still not bored. it has so much content that i literally cant complete the game, even though ive done all three main storylines. it is a great open world rpg that i can not stop playing!",1
"how could you not get this game. if you dont a quote by the regginator whats wrong with you.",1
"200+ hours on record. about only half of what i put into oblivion... but i think i liked skyrim nearly twice as much in the end. there is only one elder scrolls series, and it keeps getting better. but not better than morrowind... yet ;-)",1
"its a fun and adventurous game to play, i recommend it!",1
"theres like dragons and lizard people on it i like it a lot and its not that expensive now because its quite old loadsmods too grade: a",1
"very expansive game with unending mods really keeps you playing it.",1
"god dman rpg with amazing graphic and mods. enjoy it so far :) now im the king of skyrim :d no one can stand in my way with my 50 body guards.",1
"i waited to play through this game and get both dlcs prior to writing a review. the graphics hold up today, with mods added. if not still very beautiful and emmersive. a+ the story of multiple different quests had me enthralled from start to finish. though you have to find the quests that you specifically enjoy. (examples) i came across a walking dog that led me to its talking deity that then ended in me deciding the dogs fate. i joined a legion to defeat vampires, and then betrayed them. by becoming a vampire helping the lord of vampires himself. i became the guardian of solitude before joining a rebellion to overthrow them. i walked across a ice lake in a different dimmension, that then led me to have to fight two dragons. i summoned a dragon to aid me fight, and it led to one of the most enjoyable scene of a realtime battle mechanic i have ever seen. i usually fade in fantasy style video games, but the immersive possibilities allowed me to still want more. over a hundred of hours of quest experience, and can have more added with mods. different race aspects, and many different styles of combat you may play. this is a must have for any form of gamer. as well as something a casual should atleast give a try. one of the best purchases i have made, and i will be continuing to come back to this game to this day.",2
"because you can use a mod to fight thomas the tank engine.",1
"if you havent played this then you can just get out of my face",2
"so there i was, climbing the mountain to high hrothgar when suddenly a great frost troll appeared. lydia tried to kill him but instead i let him tail me for about ten minutes until i got to the top. thinking i would be safe going inside high hrothgar, and completely neglecting to realize that a beast with apposable thumbs was after me, i breathed a sigh of relief. suddenly, a frost troll appeared in the doorway and as i prepared to die without saving in over an hour, the greybeards started shouting the beast to death. it was pinned against the wall and unable to get up because of the amount of shouts being thrown at it. after watching these men brutally attack a troll they simply carried on as if nothing ever happened. 11/10 would watch old men brutally attack animals again",1
"kinda like fifa, and kind of like fallout, and nothing like fifa.",1
"ive played nearly 200 hours so it cant be too bad.",1
"if you were stuck on an island and you had to choose one game , this is the one to take its freaking awesome and to do everything in this game takes forever",2
"skyrim is one of the best games i have played, here is why! 1. skyrim has good graphics for its time. 2. there are alot of quest so you allways have something to do. 3. the story is not the best i have seen, but i think it has a decent story. so i give skyrim a 9.7/10",2
"sometimes i forget that real life is real while playing this game.",2
"i didnt know what the fuss about skyrim was... until i started double weiling spells, reanimating zombies, casting lightning and fire at the same time at my enemies, quiclky switching between axes, bows and spells, summoning familiars, fist-fighting dragons, blowing off enemies with my mighty roar and eating the beating hearts of my victims as i rampage in my werewolf form. just...amazing. i only wish it was easier to mke money, stupid stores never have enough cash to buy your loot.",1
"died by tripping over a kettle on legendary difficulty. 12/10",1
"who doesnt like skyrim? its graphics are outstanding, and its gameplay is pretty good. its storyline is not as good as oblivions though.. but i still prefer skyrim. with the kinds of mods out there, this game can be taken to the next generation of gaming. so uh yeah. 9.8/10",1
"my horse went mad & decided it hated me, so it took to walking back to whiterun every time i got off of it. i spent an hour & a half walking back to whiterun to get it back. best game ever! 10/10",1
"i listened to the riveting story of a town gaurd and his sudden decent into gaurdsmanship. 10/10 i cry everytime.",1
"i been playing this game before but on steam plus the all dlcs and the game is just awesome plus the workshop you can just add the mods without any problems and if you need help just go to the community and disscious and there is always people to help you out :)",1
"the best rpg all of time , you can do whatever you like",1
"gets a little bit boring after few hours, but id give it 11/10 if you still hesitate... buy it! just do it. you can trust me on this one :)",1
"this game is endless fun. there i so much depth and fun, from recovering stolen objects, to pickpocketing people, this game is awesome!",1
"got stoned and shot arrows, 10/10 would play again.",1
"greatest elder scrolls ever. from arena to skyrim it has been a fun ride!!!",3
"there isnt really much that i can say about this game that hasnt already been said. its a fantastic experience from beginning to... well, there is no end, but you can see what im trying to say. still looks absolutely beautiful after 2 years, and is just as fun as well. if you havent played it yet, i dont know what youre waiting for, buy it and enjoy one fantastic game! overall, i give skyrim a 9/10",1
"if you like open world rpgs with a huge story and tons of adventure, get this game now.",1
"rpg    , ,      the elder scrolls,        .   ,    ,    ,    .     ,        ,   bethesda softworks           rpg      .  ; ,   . 10/10.",2
"oh this game... this game is soo good that it should be worth more then $19.99 so much stuff to do so much sidequests, so much misc #bestgameever",2
"awesome play with all the cheats or just play the game etiher way its big bunch of fun and i recommend it if you have a strong computer.",1
"this game will go down in history for being so awesome.",1
"dear god... this game is the definition of awesome. just remember not to kill your wife.",2
"one of the best elder scrolls game out, the base game has a great main quest line and if you get bored of that you have 100s+ side quests to do, or you could go around finding little hiddle spots around the map. the dawnguard dlc is fun and gives you alot more side quests with a good main quest line. but the best dlc so far has to be the dragonborn dlc im still going through doing the black books i mean theres alot of stuff to do so you wont get bored with the plot and say omg this sucks why did i even buy it because i love it. overall the game is great, plus all the mods you can download really gives the game alot of life and stuff to do. i give this game a perfect 10/10 an amazing game please do buy.",1
"love it. steam workshop makes it better and more play time",2
"a late review, with reason... ive revisited this game recently after purchasing all of the dlc and installing a few (read way too many) mods. i recall for a moment that my first major pc game was half-life and why it was so special: the modding community. well, skyrim has a very special modding community that has made this another very special game to me. dont take this game at face value... though worth every penny, even before mods are involved. this game continues to give and i cant recommend it any higher. it sits as one of the top releases in recent memory for me. dont continue to pass this game up if youve failed to give it a shot. pick it up and see for yourself!",1
"this game, while not the most graphic of games, has an amazing story to it, offering so many options. it is definatly worth it.",1
"awsum also get the oblivion and morrowind and even get the daggerfall and arena",1
"amazing game, the only drawback are the sudden fps drops at somepoints im the game. none the less , this is my favourite game by far also, buying the dlcs makes a big game even bigger <3",1
"a masterpiece for single players games. a must own if you like rpgs.",1
"this game is very fun, although it is difficult in a few place it only takes about 10 mins to figure out to do. i highly recommend to get some graphic enhancer mods from the steam workshop before playing.",1
"facemelting epicness <3 a game that never ends and never gets old",1
"now that the modding community has matured with this game...a careful selection of mods brings this game into the a+ category for me. thank you modders!!",4
"if you have a problem with the launcher just update your drivers with geforce experience",1
"beautiful, genre-defining roleplaygame with a acceptable combatsystem, a world worth exploring dozens of hours and quite few restricitons in how to play your character. this is often critizied: the mage in platearmour etc., but dont forget: if you want a assassin style only character without mind for spells or heavy armor, noone forces you to do anything different.",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. bought it for the computer after i played on the xbox.may not be the best graphics. but this game is great 9/10 rating thumbs up. very good rpg fantasy adventuring game. if you like rpgs dont miss up a pass to get this one.",1
"much better than on console. my pc can handle much more and mods are amazing. a great addition to an already amazing game.",1
"125 hours in, level 50+, not even near done. just too much fun. you can make this game be whatever you like, enjoy your own adventure. i will say that the game is a bit too easy really once you level up appropriately and it definitely gets redundant. the same monsters, the same attacks. need variation. didnt stop me from enjoying it. get it now if you havent.",1
"too good of a game to miss. cant wait for the next the elder scrolls game, which if not counting the dissapointment called elder scrolls online, should be really good. but all in all this game and series is just so good it deserves 5/5!",2
"this is one of those games that all gamers need to play, especcially with the numerous mods support. the open world setting is constantly drawing you in to explore the massive map of skyrim. and again, the mods take this from being a game using an earlier rendereing process, to a hardware demanding game that looks as good as any game release in the past year. if you purchase skyrim, i would highly recommend the complete version with all dlc. as the stories presented in the dlc are just as good as the original game, and add more variety (and new locations). i would give it a 9.8 out of 10 (one of the best games i have played in the past decade)",1
"seriously anybody who has not heard of or already fallen in love with this game needs to buy it stat",1
"you could run this on a toaster i swear. mods are great 10/10 would get this gifted to me again.",1
"this game is rather dull, grey colors, honestly it feels like they are flaunting the fact that it has dragons. the level up systems feels kinda dull and there isnt much to it, making the characters feel very cut and paste, along with not having much filling the world. i would advise anyone get morrowind or oblivion rather than play this.",1
"this game doesnt even need a review. if you dont know how awesome this game is, then you must not have had access to internet for the past few years. this. game. has. dragons. tons of them. oh, theres tons of mods for it too, such as the potatodagger. pros: mods, dragons, you can kill things cons: is racist toward elves a++",1
"fun but i dont know how to breathe irl or in game so it made it a toonsy bit inconvineint when i had to take breaks to dunk head in fish barrel upset.",1
"i originally didnt like this game. i loved the soundtrack. eventually, i kept playing it. the gameplay gets dull but the immersion in this game is quite high. and like i said, the music is quite lovable. this game is like having sex with a hooker while john williams composes the score: you get to have sex with a hooker with good music, even if the hooker never read kama sutra.",1
"this game is everything i can ever hope for in a game!",2
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is my favourite game of all time. for potential buyers, skyrim is an open-world rpg that positions you as the dragonborn. your quest is to save the world from imminent destruction by slaying dragons. however, youre also free to do as you like. from trading with caravans, killing the undead draugr or even jsut cooking, there is a lot to do. despite the large amount of glitches, as bethesda games often have, they wont take away from your experience. on top of this, theyre also quite generous with dlc by providing entirely new weapons, skills and playable areas. this is just vanilla skyrim! once you use mods, anything can happen! i cannot recommend skyrim enough.",1
"this has to be the best game i have ever bhought... its a game for almost everyone... plus it has tons of mods in the nexus!",2
"the hype is real...you almost have too much to do in this game.",1
"the scenery in this game is great, the world seems to come alive and really creates the fourth wall of belief. add to that the vibrant characters and great crafting system and you have a game that could be played for hundreds of hours. not to mention replaying the game making different choices. i would reccomed this game to anyone who wants to suspend disbelief and immerse themselves in a different world.",2
"this game is                           failed on the m",1
"300 hours in skyrim with more yet to play thats for damned sure. so many things to do... go questing, do some dungeon delving, snipe bandits with arrows, stare at the aurora borealis, drink mead, smash the draugr into bonemeal, pester the local giants, steal some items some shop, discover some ancient dwarven place, stand on a snowblown mountain side, help the local village with a pesky dragon, pick some ingredients and brew up some potions, craft some weapons / armor, drop your armor in an icey river and take on a sabercat in your skivvies. plus theres a lot of mods to check out. this is a great game with many hours of gameplay. highly recommended!",2
"depends on your graphics card. if you can play it on medium settings with high resolution textures buy it its wonderful, on low settings though it looks like oblivion on low settings, and for those of you who havent played oblivion, thats no good. by the way if you havent played oblivion or skyrim do oblivion first they are both wonderful games but i would go oblivion first. buy any elder scrolls game and rejoice they are all good, including morrowind. basiclly if you have the equivilent of the intel hd 4600 or above then this is the game for you, if you have like the intel hd 2500 go ahead and get oblivion, (if you have intel gma then get morrowind).",1
"i am now doing my third playthru of skyrim. there are so many ways to play this game. and i dont mean just the factions. the skills and perks you use completely change your playstyle. in one game, my skills/perks went to light armor, stealth, archery, etc. in my current one im putting points in the magicka perks and heavy armor. why do you think people make alts in warcraft? its because you can only have 2 profession skills. this is the same thing. 50 perk points is not enough! and watching your character grow skill/perkwise is a lot of fun.",4
"at 20$, it is an absolute ing steal. bethesda are screwing themselves over. would pay the full price at release. one more thing. mods.",2
"dull visual experience, repetitive caves and repetitive fights. would be nice if game was tougher and there were opportunities to pvp or party up and pve in this... its only fun if you really really enjoy playing games on your own.",1

"the mods make this game fresh and worth playing again. originally got this game on xbox and played it to death even with all the dlc. made probably about 100 alternative characaters to offset the fact that you become too powerful. with the mods here increasing and decreasing the difficulty is not an issue. you can even add new boss battles!",1
"this game is amazing!!!! the story is great! and the open-world is great too! i would highly recommend you to get this game!!!!",1
"if you dont have this game... buy it if you do have this game... why are you reading this?",1
"really fun and full of glithces that make you laugh. you are completely free to progress how you want, the way you want. the only issue ive got is that its one of those games where if you put it down... you dont pick it back up. fun though. especially when riding up a mounting at a 65 degree angle on a horse.",1
"i drink to my youth, to the weeks come and gone, for my hours of skyrim are just about done. i fought off the stormcloaks, ran imperials through - as an arch-mage and werewolf and guildmaster, too. long live ulfric! or kill him or whatever. ive fought the war twice and not one side is better. im the hero of skyrim; everyones in my debt - but if i kill a chicken, theyll all want me dead. now its alduin time, and im finally prepared, my friends have all left me, but i simply dont care. (10/10, would rhyme again)",1
"one of the best games ever created, loads of fun is found.",1
"this game is very time consuming, with a ton of quests and sidequests to do itll keep you busy. upgrading your weapons and finding allies (companions) to fight by your side or it can be a spawn of your own powers. i highly recommend this game, though i bought it for 7 dollars. its well worth the full price too.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a very good game in my opinion. being a person who very much enjoyed the other games in the elder scrolls series i believe this one is another game in the series that adds a lot of great gameplay features and replay value.",3
"one of the best games ive ever played. the massive open world and the ability to choose what you want to do and dont and tha you can choose want you want to say makes the game an awesome game. only problem is trying to climb the buggy mountains. 9/10 stars!",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a fantastic rpg, possibly the best of its kind. stunning graphics, an actual storyline which you bother to look at, great gameplay and sooo much stuff to do. it might have glitches - some, more annoying than others - and the guards might make you want to kill something, but it is still fantastic. if you like rpgs and you have not tried skyrim, shame on you. shame. on. you. the verdict: 9/10 + stunning graphics, brutal combat, and a storyline that actually makes you want to kill this dude. - annoying glitches, it ruined my life i play it so much.",1
"this game only stops being fun once your computer cant handle any more mods... but then you just delete some and start again!!! :d",1
"in this game you play as fusrodah, the last skyrim on earth (tat means he was born frum the dagons.) your goal is to kill the last boss who is dovarkin, the super dragon. on your way to kil him you must complet qests and kill enemys, or perhaps join the stealers guild or hogwarts in order to learn magic. 8/10 grapics 9/10 gamesplay it is good to play",1
"when i saw the first trailer for this game, my friends were freaking out about it saying it was gonna be the best thing ever...they all really liked oblivion. i never really liked oblivion that much, so i was pretty skeptical about this game. then the hype grew...and grew...and i watched gameplay videos...and then it was released, and it was the best game i had ever played. seriously, this game is perfect in every regard, worth the 60 dollars, infinite hours of gameplay, you just cant stop having fun in this game. 11/10 es",1
"say goodbye to your life, this game is crazily addictive and full of epic content just waiting for you to kill/explore. feels like a true open-world rpg with mountains to scale and quests to do. i highly recommend skyrim and you definately get your moneys worth.",1
"i have put soo many hours into the xbox 360 edition of this game and lucking forward to doing the same on my pc",1
"possibly the best game i have ever played. countless hours of my life were lost to this game and i enjoyed every second of it. community made mods make this game infinitely better. 99/100",2
"i love this game so much that they need to make another one but bigger and more awesome",1
"buy this game. now. its probably one of the best games out there with amazing mod support! timeless and a gigantic open world game.",1
"considering that this game has consumed my life the way a dragonborn consumes a dragons soul. ten out of ten. my main problem with games is that i beat them too fast and then lose interest afterwards. skyrim has given me so much to do that i dont know where to even start. dont feel like doing the main quest? dont do it. this game has the freewill that a lot of others lack.",1

"played the hell out of this game, and still wanting to play more. never heard of the elder scrolls before skyrim, but its such a beautiful game <3 5/5",2
"probably one of my best purchases on a pc. came from playing skyrim on xbox 360 and afterwards will probably never touch a console again. nexus mod manager and this game combined makes it pretty much an endless game as long as modders continue supporting this game. i have realvision enb along with probably 100 mods and the game is seriously gorgeous.",1
"9.4/10 skyrim, this, i can truthfully say, is onle of the best games i have ever played. the immersive feel of whenever youre trying to bow down enemies of your guild with a bow, the role playing of drinking beer i n a bar, the fear that you feel when you see a troll. all of these factors make skyrim my favorite rpg. the sheer quantity of things you can do, the ways you can play, you way you can look! when you play skyrim, you feel like youre really choosing your own path, more than just an alternate ending, or a certian team. you choose what you do; and how you do it. ive never played a game like it, you really get to know it well, get in to routines, without it ever seeming repetitive, you just enjoy knowing where to run, or how to hide. even when you do get to know skyrim, complete the quests, max out your skills. you introduce yourself to the vast modding comunity, both on the nexus and on the workshop, you can get so many different types of mods, being able to see that dragons wing in more quality, or adding a whole new hold on a far away island, you never run out of mods to explore. these things are what add to why skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time, a must buy for and roleplayer, explorer or combat-lover",1
"one of the best games i ever played. most atmospheric bethesda game, best voice acting from a bethesda game but a bit lack luster in content in comparison to previous elder scrolls installments. nonetheless, it is still a fun and enjoyable game to play and made only better with the modding community. highly recommend to mod the game. p.s. hail ulfric and the stormcloaks!",1

"wow very graphic so dragonborn wow such awesome must buy much dragons doge allowed",1
"among the best, most-complete gaming experiences i have encountered ever, let alone from bethesda (who have a reputation for releasing incomplete material). combined with the steam workshop and the other modding communities on the web, skyrim is still a powerhouse years after its initial release.",2
"its not like an oblivion or morrowind but its a the best rpg with open world.",1
"one of the best games that i have ever played. i know that the combat is not great but i dont really love skyrim for its combat, it is a solid exploration game with so much to do. the story and gameplay are a bit linear but its awesome fun all the way. the two content dlcs do add a ton of stuff to do in this game. music is simply brilliant. definitely a must buy.",1
"good game. highly moddable too, if you have a decent pc.",1
"eh i have a couple of hours playing this game plus i have 200 more hours in console this game is not addictive",1

"best. game. ever. 666/666. rpg classic. dragonborn 4lyfe. thanks to this game, i became friends with werewolves, wizards, vampire and vampire hunters and freakin dragons that talk, im now the hottest person in skyrim and i feel super important. thx mom for having me so i could play dis game. best game i ever played for sure.",1

"great game overall. great mechanics. tbh just doing this to get an achievement. love the game!",1
"this game is so fun with so much to do. you can chose what you want to do and play way different then your friends while both enjoying the experience. with this game your not limited to the main quest but other side quests some small some big. not to mention you can mod this game with both the workshop and from websites adding even more to the experince. even if you have played skyrim before on a console, to get the true skyrim expeince (along with downloading mods) you must play it on pc. def a must buy. 10/10",2
"possibly the one of the best open world rpgs out there today. the ability to mod it makes the gameplay almost endless. i myself disliked the previous games tes3 and tes4, but found myself wrapped up in 5 as if it was a totally different experience. honestly, if you didnt like the previous 2, you will probably like it. if you loved one of the previous two, you are going to be disapointed for some reason, but still, try it. while you may not think its as great as your favorite, im sure you will still enjoy it.",1
"people always say skyrim is great oblivion is great but lets be honest unlike call of duty when another elder scrolls title is on a game you know you will be suckedin and wont let go until youve claimed true title oof dragon born dovahking",1
"one of the best games ever. with the addons from the workshop its even better.",2
"amazing game, it has a huge map and many quests, i doubt i will ever finish it 100% xd the mods for the game arent bad either!",1
"i cant give this game enough praise. sure the main story lacks abit, but the sidequests, the world and especialy the modding community is amazing. the mods make this game one of the best games i have ever played.",2
"9.7/10 truly amazing game with no limits. skyrim is fun, but the combat is boring. it is very rmb, hold lmb, rmb. i know many will disagree but it basically always come back to that. the story is very good, the graphics are great, the characters are memerable, and the games replay value is through the roof. in the end the game is worth every penny.",1
"this game is amazing if you want to explore, kill, steal, battle, or do random awesome stuff this game is for you. its even got a freaking dragon. there are no guns but over all this game is amazing. q:who would make a review for this game that is bad? a: a newb. get this game trust me you will love this.",1
"best rpg i have ever played hands down! its a must get and well worth the price.",1

"this game is what makes rpg worth playin gthe storyline is great and it has a great choices with hours of content and quests that are great in there own right the only problem i have is the texture which can be easily made better with mods personally i would give this a 9/10 for rating.",1
"mod it till it crashes. then complain to your friends that it keeps on crashing.",2

"released in 2011 and still one of the most played games in my arsenal! need i say more?",1
"love the game, the worlds is among the more lifefull in terms of events. there have been times where i sit and listen to a bard playing music in front of a fire, its that good. bethesda have done a great job, it has such depth and excellent atmosphere. definitely a must have if you enjoy rpg games.",1
"never played an elder scrolls game before this but was tempted by the hype of eso so bought their anthology and its more than lived up to its reputation - i cant say enough great things about this game. anyway im hooked so back to questing, exploring and decision making",1

"you will not regret a cent when you buy this game, there is so much to see and do. not to mentions mods, which can easily give one playthrough thousands upon thousands of hours of playtime. you need to get this game, there has not been any other western rpg like it sence its release and there probibly will not be anytime soon. not untill elder scrolls vi comes around.",1

"actually, skyrim is skyrim, and its enough. of course, you may argue the question of the best tes game as long as you want to, but you have to admit: skyrim is great.",2
"i already had a copy on ps3 but its been phenomonal rediscovering skyrim through the modding scene on pc. mods like skyui, frostfall and enb visual tweaks make even a huge amount of playtime on a console well worth exploring it again on pc. i hope bethesda continue to allow their games to have life long after their release through modding.",1
"brilliant game. but you have to install appropriate mods to make it even better.",1
"this was my game of 2011 and 2012. i spent the better part of a year and a 1/2 playing it. it is that fun. the world is much larger and much easier to explore then the last eldar scrolls game (oblivion). much of the complexity in terms of skills / stats/ abilities has been trimed down for a tighter core experiance. i found it to be better this way, i dont see myself saying this game would be a lot better if there were seperate skills for long swords and medium swords). the greatest addtion core character wise is the addtion of perks, a system that rewards leveling with increased skill ability. you can choose which perk areas you want to upgrade, and by using a given skill set (let say swords) you level up that particular area. story is relativley generic, yet some how powerful. i do feel like i am the only one that can save this world. the quests are varied and you never know what you are going to get. i have played through this game at least 5 times and i still always find new things to do, dungeons to explore and quests to complete. i cannot do justice to this game other then saying you should buy it and you should pllay it.",1
"gosh... just one of the best all-around games out there. limitless hours of gameplay.",1
"from the creators of fallout 3 and the elder scrolls series of epic proportions",1

"completely awesome, i cant even imagine how much better the next one will be o.o",2
"so i originally had this game on my xbox 360 since the first day it was released. but two days ago i decided to re-purachse it for my pc and i have no regrets what so ever, the game is alot better on pc in all ways. and if you cant really be bothered downloading mods off of a website like me, you can just get them through steam workshop by simply subscribing to the selected mod. would reccomend this game to anyone who likes rpgs, fantasy or just swinging swords about.",1
"awesome game that is quite addictive to play. however, dont burn yourself out while playing it!",1
"this game is amazing. very well orchestrated music accompanied by beautiful graphics makes this game the best fantasy adventure i have played ever. the gameplay is slow and gritty, with three main classes: thief, mage, and warrior, all equally fun. the variety between one thing to the other is immense because of subtlety. for example, weapons ranks are based on their material, and every material makes the weapon change but not by too much, making it more realistic, although there could have been more variety in these weapons. there was one side-quest which the key item was a sword, there were books on this and to get this started i was pumped, but to my dismay it was a regular shape. there are few varieties in crafted weapons, which is my only negative comment, other than the occasional glitch. i give the elder scrolls v: skyrim a 9/10",1
"this game is awesome. i can play anytime and the mod provides me lots of more fun.",2
"let me clear things up by assuring you that none of the quest bugs, graphical issues, gameplay glitches, or unexplained crashes ive encountered can change the fact that i played this amazing rpg for well over 100 hours (mostly on xbox) in the past couple weeks and absolutely loved it.",1
"this is such a cool game. you can do so much, it feels like you want to play it forever, which i think of. from a looking like a citizen to a fierce warrior, a wizard, a sneaky archer, or you can be all of those things at once! hey bethsda, i think this is your best game.",1
"forced a woman to put a giants toe in a soup made for the emperor. 10/10",1

"had this on ps3 now i got it on my new pc build it looks fantastic. :)",1
"amazing game !!!! i origionally bought for xbox and liked it but it was missing something , mods and commands . this makes the game way more enjoyable i have recommend you too buy this game and ive played days and days on xbox and just bought the summer sale #skyrim",1
"got this on the 50% off sale, but its worth the full price in my opinion. if its on sale, get it fast. played practically non-stop for 2 days so far, and im sure ill log many more hours in the future.",1
"this is the best freaking free roaming rpg ever. i usually dont play western rpg, im more of a final fantasy guy, but still this is freaking awesome. even after 80 hours its awesome, even if you play it on a laptop (which i do play it on) its awesome. every steamer 18+ has to buy this game or else fail.",1
"even if you only played the vanilla skyrim it would be well worth the money. but here is the great thing about this already great game, the fantastic modding community. hour of hours of extra quests & content, updated graphics & sound, added lore, items, weapons and armor. overall rating: 9/10",1
"where to start. again, open world, missions, enemies, challenges, castles, weapons, armor, magic, shouts, and really good main story. one of my personal favorites ;). with 78 hours on the record, this is a gggrrreaaaatttt, great, great first-person action game. (so amazing, i ran out of periods in my quotes)",1
"bethesda sandbox, you are either with it, or you think it is stupid. i am with it, so i love this game. a lot more stable than fallout 3 and esiv: oblivion. like all bethesda sandbox games, it is all about the mods.",2
"i highly recommend this game. personally i belive this games age rating is over rated, as there isnt much gore, (well bar decapitation) and swearing is minimal. this game never truely ends, as i have completed all storyines and quests, but restarting and playing from scratch is still a gripping experiance. the modding community is amazing (sometimes xd) and brings a whole new leace of life to a game that strangely resembles game of thrones in a lot of ways...",2
"i started playing the elder scrolls series at morrowind, a game that sucked away hundreds of hours of my life. skyrim is a wonderful addition to the series, with beautiful graphics, sounds, and a well-written main storyline. i love the player interactions with the npcs, the interconnectivity of actions (e.g. if you kill someone with a living relative, that relative will send an assassin after you), and the dragons! for new players, skyrim offers a nice tutorial as your first quest, giving you time to adjust to the controls and learn how to fight in a controlled environment. plus, the game levels up your enemies as you grow, so you dont have to worry about dying while you walk around. and while people familiar with the elder scrolls already know a lot of the lore, new players will not miss out by not playing previous games. spoiler alert: my one complaint is the games insistence that a player choose one side in the civil war. during the main quest, you learn that the civil war is a construct by the thalmor. but you cannot use this knowledge to get either side to stop fighting. and i see the good and bad points of both sides. i would love for bethesda to put out some dlc that allows players to unite the empire and the rebels against the thalmor. in the meantime, i avoid joining either side of the fight.",2
"awesome game. with extreme high of graphic quality, while my character almost die from fighting with that motherf**ker spider i almost die from arachnophobia at the same time. so realistic !!",1
"with mods this is almost as good as morrowind. just almost, but still far away.",1
"there are no more barriers to cross. all i have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem i have caused and my utter indifference toward it i have now surpassed. my pain is constant and sharp, and i do not hope for a better world for anyone. in fact, i want my pain to be inflicted on others. i want no one to escape. but even after admitting this, there is no catharsis; my punishment continues to elude me, and i gain no deeper knowledge of myself. no new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. this confession has meant nothing.",1
"its an elder scrolls game...what else do i need to say?",1
"a grand accomplishment for bethesda. ive been wondering why beths game are so pricey, but it shows; its one of the best looking game of our generation. buggy and slow when it came out (like every bethesda games), the polish that was added via patches, the dlcs and the steam workshop all added up and made the game what it is today: a modern video game masterpiece.",5
"i liked oblivion more, but skyrim is worthy of all your spare time. excellent atmosphere, incredible graphics, fun combat, nice story. its a pity dialogues are so short and scarce...",1
"yes this is a great game my favorite game i defitly recomend this",2
"started playing this game without mods at first, wasnt too bad. then with mods, i cant go back. about a 6/10 without mods, and nearly 9/10 with mods. the mods basically make the game what it should have been, luckily i got them.",1
"this is one of the best games i have ever played... and the mods you can get for it... its worth the money.",2
"i love this game its awesome you can explore add mods and just fun buy ledgendary and you will get all the dlcs cheaper",1

"well done game with massive replay value and an excellent modding community",1
"good lord this is the best game ever. all dlcs bought, two hours short of four hundred hours. if i could marry a game this would be the one. i can not recommend for you to only get the regular addition. the dlcs make it so much better but are still amazing without it. if you want a game thats going to give you your moneys worth this is the one. i have lost days of sleep on this game, it has made my work in school suffer, but i regret nothing because of the pure awesomeness that is this game. get. it. if i had infinite money the first thing i would do is buy everyone with a computer this game. there is no game i could recommend more.",2
"spent more time playing this one than the last two tes games combined - my favorite game of 2011.",2
"this game is like my girfriend. its is so good icant stop playing with it",4
"10/10 welcome to skyrim fight, learn skills, cast spells, plunder, fight a fu**ing dragon!!! all in a days work of skyrim.i was so impressed by the visual concept and story line after 1 year on console it cathes me coming back for now on pc i play every day buy this even if you dont like rpgs this is amazing",1
"i freaking love this game. so many things to do, so many people to kill (innocent or guilty) its your choice. something giving you trouble? console up some uber armor, hp pots, swords, whatever the heck you want ot dont cheat and go hardcore on their dragon behinds. this is one of my desert island top 5 games, easily with no doubt. probably number 1 actually, only competing with torchlight 2 and sacred 2. buy it with your money, heck someone elses money just get it!! tell em dave sent you.",1
"any game that lets you use a power to wildly fling ragdoll physic bodies off of a cliff doesnt need any other recommendation. its an elder scrolls game, which can be hit and miss for some folks, but if youre open to experiencing an open world sort of rpg with a story that lets you approach at your own pace? this is a great game. more so, if you dont like any aspect of it? you can just go ahead and download mods to change nearly any portion of it.",2
"this game is awesome. never really gets old because there are always new mods coming out.",1
"open ended, gorgeous, easily moddable, and with great core gameplay and story. despite my love of morrowind, i still say this is the best of the elder scrolls games. do anything. do everything. above all else, its fun from the first second to the last.",1
"the... best... game... in... the world!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"the most entertaining game ive ever played.mere perfection.",1
"skyrim is an excellent game. its beautiful, and it really sells the illusion that you can do anything. i love the skill development system, where you do stuff, and then that skill gets better. i love the perk system, where you can boost some skills artificially. i really like bow hunting & smithing & alchemy, and running around collecting things to smith and to turn into potions. i only wish that your character didnt come with this built in destiny, because i always feel like i should be doing something more important than chasing butterflies or wandering down into caves.",1
"one of the most beautiful, compelling and artistic games made in the history of video games. the story is phenomenal, the voice actors are outstanding, and the graphics..... they put hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game to make it beautiful and it came out a masterpiece. 10 out of 10, reccomend everyone play this game at least once in their lifetime.",3
"totally recommend it everybody! its super fun and you could get mods for it plus you could play this game for hours to find all the rare items and secrets in the game!",1
"very enjoyable game, though the only thing really keeping me playing it are the mods. played for days on console, will continue to play for months on pc.",2
"my favourite game- there are not enough words to express how immersive and enjoyable this game is. once you finish the introduction, the world of skyrim is your oyster. want to save skyrim? go ahead! want to be a nomad, a pacifist even? best of luck to you! want to kill every single resident- living, unliving and everything in between? be my guest.",2
"a great rpg! i recommend getting it, but be warned. you wont leave your computer for weeks!",1

"plenty of gameplay and in game options, worth investing the 20.00 dollars into this",1
"oblivion was such a great game and to improve on that i thought was impossible but bethedsa did it with skyrim. i would rate this game a 11/10",1

"as for me probably second best rpg ever after witcher 1. in two weeks made over 40 hrs. right now on hold. great ammount of mods to improve almost anything you want plus a lot of extra quests for end game. i expect at least of 200-300 hrs of fun before cracking it. if you love rpg and open world game its a must have. 9/10 (cause bethesda dont care to remove some bugs). 11/10 in scale of rpgs.",1

"this game is freaking awesome. it suits my gamestyle! im surprised i passed on previous elder scrolls and now regret it. i recommend this game to everyone who loves dragons, dungeons, grinding, fantasy style setting, awesome graphics and much more. this is my the very first elder scroll that i played and it instantly became my 2nd top favorite game of all time. i dont like dlcs but i cant wait for more content on this one. vodahkiin!!",1

"an amazing game have spent many hours playing through all the quests. there is also the fact that the game is so easy to mod to make even better",2
"simply the best game i have ever played. no matter what i always end up loving gameplay, even when i seem as if im not even in the mood to play the game. landscape, crafting, skills, npcs, quests, jobs, marriage, adoption, houses, currency. bethesda did an amazing job creating such a realistic magical universe.",1
"you can shoot fire out of your face! is there more to explain?",1
"this is my first game playing any elder scrolls game and i must admit that life around me cease to exist on the first day playing it when i got immerse in the world of skyrim. there are so many things to do that it doesnt feel repetitive. it doesnt feel like it will ever end and because of it, this game offer the best bang for your buck. with the steam summer sale i couldnt refuse to not buy it. its so worth it. ive enjoyed playing other open world games such as the grand theft auto series but dont know why i havent play this game in the first place. better late than never",1
"amazing game. provides hours of gameplay, dlc or not. great modding community. the only thing holding it back is the glitches.",1
"this game is amazing. i have played it on my xbox360 and it is just better on pc, the mods on this game makes it even better. i will highly recommend it to al who like open world games.",1
"the good thing about skyrim is you cant beat it in a day. the game is very time consuming and very fun, the story line keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the wonderful graphics make me realize how great this game truley is. skyrim is worth it, and so is the dlc. if your looking for a game where you can free-roam, complete quests, and overall have a great time, then this is the game for you. +graphics +story line +quests +time consuming +free-roam rating: 9/10",1

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim... oh, all the things you can say about this modern marvel. the elder scrolls have always been gams that captured my imagination, and immersed me into the world of tamriel. ever since morrowind i have been an absolute die-hard of the tes, and this game. in tradition to previous elder scrolls, most of what makes the franchise unique is preserved and escalated to new levels. some changes i dont like (such as the previous class system disappearing) but they are hardly a deal breaker, and i often over look them when i see the gorgeous landscapes, dark dungeons, and enchanting lore. a whole laundry list of mods, and hours of fun. buy now",1
"very awesome rpg. i think its even better than oblivion.",2
"overall: great fun. if you like exploring, roaming and looting, this is definately the game for you. skyrim is a huge place, where youll find mostly scandinavian-like countryside, but still a huge variety of ambience and style. i did not really play this for the story, it is kinda interesting, but not too deep and pretty short. the main part of the game (at least for me) is roaming, sidequests and exploring. there are quite some generic misc-quests which will send you into a dungeon you then finish and return the quest. this might get boring after a while. however it is very exciting for a lot of dungeons. the dwemer ruins especially are awesome. but still, if you find yourself stuck with boring quests, there is the steam-workshop loaded with free mods and/or custom made questlines. potential for hundreds of hours of gameplay!",1
"hands down best game ive ever played. logged over 700+ hours on ps3 version (with all 3 dlcs). now starting from scratch on pc version. the graphics of skyrim pc has all but converted me from console to pc gamer!",1

"oh-my-god ! exponantially awesome ! must play and replay.",1
"this game is proof that art can exist in videogames too , its an astonishing masterpiece!",1
"i think time spend in this game tells the story nearly 700h of gameplay and i still love to return to skyrim. buy play enjoy! p.s. keep calmn and fus-ro-dah!",3
"great mods, huge map, midieval age like gta, tones of submissions, freely messing around, pick pockets, break into npcs house, kill the city guards, non-essential npcs being killed and their house is become to you. sh*t! this must be the best game i had ever played.",1
"45,000 people a day still play this game....damn...lol 2,500 a day for elder scrolls online.....free to play soon maybe?",1
"i love this game. so much. i have the legendary edition for the 360 and have logged over 120 hours on just one character. the world is so big, the graphics are so detailed, there are so many quests, etc that you never find the same thing really twice. theres always something to do, even if you have completed the main story. hell, if you dont want till the very end, you dont have to do the main story except the intro. its just... oh, its such a great game. its sublime. its godlike. its gooooooood.",1

"the elder scrolls v. truly the fantasy game for all the never ends. dispite a game that has come out years ago this game has a modding community that never stops adding content on a range a scale where you can go from being a master thief to chaning to the game to a full scale star wars theme. follow the story line as you start as a prisonor or go through on your own trail finding every nock and cranny, this game will keep you busy for hundred of hours in its massive open sandbox world. you will get every penny worth spent in this purchase.",1
"most addicting game ever! i have played older games like oblivion and morrowind but i think skyrim is better than them morrowind: best storyline oblivion: best gameplay skyrim: best graphics",2
"if youve played the earlier elder scrolls series morrowind and oblivion then skyrim you will love the game is set in the next land called skyrim you are captured and sent to the block for crimes sort of unknown to the player, but things take a turn for the worse when a dragon destorys the village and you use this to escape from being killed. it is here you are giving the chance to explore the beautiful world of skyrim and meet all different kinds of folk and become the hero to save the world of skyrim. the combat is fairly the same with an improved leveling up system the world looks amazing but the added bonus is the steam workshop where people around the world have created mods to enhance the game or add things to make the world of skyrim even better. there are litery 100s of mods to choose from from the workshop as well as the 3rd party app nexus mod manger which have also has 100s of mods to make your experience better. the game is great edition to the series and you can be spending around 100 hrs+ because there is that so much to do.",1
"the ultimate time sink. i have not gotten sick of this game at all in the last 3 years, and i will probably never be sick of it. truly an amazing game.",2
"its the best game ever you have for at least 250 houres of gameplay it is just incredible!",1
"this game is the most amazing thing in the world! ive owned it one ps3 and xbox 360 and now i own it for pc. ive logged hundreds of hours between the two consoles and i cant reccomen this game highly enough.",1
"first of all. this has to be one of the most fun games of all time. i think it is the only game i have ever played where it litterally does not end. you will always find a new cave, new enemy, new quests, new things to do, etc. if you are a fan of lord of the rings, you must get this game. even if you dont like lord of the rings, you should get it. the story is so engaging and nothing feels tacked on or out of place. everything has a purpose and everything has a reason for being there with their own story. its great! i have no idea why you would not get this game. oh side note, the dlc for the game is great even though i dont own it yet. i have played it on my friends computer and they add even more content to an aready content loaded game. in closing, if you dont buy this game you are a fool!!! a fool!!! it is way to good to pass up rating: 11/10 blows me away",1
"an openworld rpg in the age of swords and bows. what could be better? maybe an openworld rpg in the age of swords and bows with dragons? yeah! pros: -huuuuuuge gametime, really big amount of quests -you can choose your role, your hands are surely not tied. (play as mage, warrior, thief, sneaky archer; your choice!) -easy modding -beautiful graphics cons: -few bugs - not too much, considering what a huge game it is",1
"this game is just awesome! open world, lot of story main and background, big skill tree, very goog mechanics if you like fantasy like lotr or got you will like it... also you can mod it so it is even better. sometimes some bugs happen but you can fix it (console commands,workshop or nature way) after all that this is one of the best games ever made :)",1
"absolutely brilliant rpg. very open game. beautiful to behold, and so much fun just to explore the world. brilliant. just brilliant. only problem is it is not multiplayer.",1
"the best and most expansive rpg ever created, you will get at least 100 hours out of this game. btw, i have many, many hours in this game on another account.",1
"literally one of the best games ive played in a long while. you can play it over and over and youll find something new to see or do. i love the storyline and the different quests you can partake in. the graphics are truly stunning. the amount of mods you can download makes it even better. i have nothing negative to say, other than youll lose hours and hours of your life to this game. :<",1
"i dont own the game but i can write a review. 10/10",1
"a perfect simulator of for many situations! have you ever wanted to know what happens when: you have really really bad breath and shout at people? you want to rob a store but your only weapon is a bucket? you hear the phrase took an arrow to the knee 2000 times an hour? you have just killed a dragon, feel like a roman god, but killing a moose makes a giant angry? you realise you have been playing the game for 40 hours, but you are nowhere near the end? all this and more in skyrim!",1
"i can feel tht half of my soul have been trap in this world! once u start playing....say goodbye to your previous game because u might not play them anymore......this game is worth for 59.99!! everything in this game is almost perfact!! grapghic,song,theme,gameplay,environment,storyline and whatever in this game! thanks for my friend out there(lim dong yun) because he gave me this superior awesome game xd",1
"do i really have to write a review? this game is flipping amazing",1
"great game full of in-depth lore, and endless character possibilities, it is a very mod friendly game too.",1
"its technically a never ending game. there are a pool of races that you can choose to be for the game as well as hundreds of thounsand of mods that you can play with. travel distance from one town to another might be far, but there are definitely some caves or fort to be discovered. however, if you dislike to play it steps by steps, there are numerous command that can level you up instantly, tons of gold, instant quest complete which is highly not recommended. nevertheless, the main quest and side quest can barely to be finish in a short period of time. this game does consume a hell lot of time, but it will stay on for years and you wont get bored with it.",1
"this is a cursed, ive lost 3 month(straight) of my life because of this game and im totally find with it. at first i get this game from a friend (cracked, and im not proud) and ive already played all of its quest (95% completed), but one day my desktop brokedown and i have to replace a new motheboard and formating my computer and all, to make story short ive lost the game, but im soo hook into the game i have to buy, no! i need to buy the game back, it was the greatest decision of my life. and it turns out, after purchasing the game(finally), all of my saved game file stiil there, apparently i didnt delete the safe game so when i bought the new game, it simply continue from where i left it at the first place(best day ever), and additional now i can download this tons of new mod from the steam workshop!!...how cools is that, ive cleared all of the map and quests.... and you know what, i still keep creating new character and play it all over again, exploring the whole new skyrim in a whole new perspective. this is a must for all gamers out there, i would put skyrim align other legendary title. just remember skyrim devour your life, this is a curse, a curse that im proud to have",1
"skyrim is brilliant! it is all about you the dragonborn defeating the evil dragon alduin. it is really fun and i dont want to spoil for you, if you want to know what happens buy the game.",1
"if you have a steam account and you dont own skyrim then is there even a point??? buy this game. now. along with morrowind and oblivion.",2
"loving this game, i have like 40 mods already. this game looks incredible and feels incredible now.",1
"at the time of writing this review, im well over 60 hours into the game and have barely scratched the surface. sometimes game worlds are created that wholly- absorb you, but skyrim goes the extra mile. listening to all the failures of the previous games, like the perturbing eye contact in conversation or the repetativness of the dungeon system, skyrim stands atop a pile of great ideas and holds itself victor. there are so many ways to play, from the stealthy murderer to the stalwart mage, from the spellsword to the devout warrior, skyrim will love you and tell your hair looks great today. with millions of quests, dragons, mammoth tribes and socio-economic battles going on, theres always something to do in the snowy-tundra of skyrim. enter the world. release your imagination. loose your girlfriend. something to behold, wholley and truly.",1
"mod this to the max. skyrim is your life now. ignore rl. repeat.",1
"hands down, one of the best rpgs ive ever played. whats great about skyrim is that it appeals to such a broad gaming audience, and everyone can find some way to enjoy it. if you want to hack-n-slash, no problem. follow every side quest and read every book series in the game, no problem. collect/hoard every item that you find along you adventures, no problem. theres really no stress at all with building your character (and enjoying the world) in the way that suits your own personal lifestyle and gaming preferences. id recommend this game to anyone who enjoys immersing themselves in a beautiful rpg, or alternatively, anyone who wants to taste the rpg world one short sitting at a time.",1
"i recommend skyrim because its the fifth in a game run called the elder scrolls and has a very good reputation thoughtout the games that bethesda have made. its an rpg (role play game) and won the game of the year in 2011. it has masses of quests to complete and follows a life-like social aspect that makes you feel like you can understand the game better. the graphics are unbelievable and makes thier world almost as clear as our own.",4
"great game, and with the right mods it can have beautiful graphics and game mechanics!",1
"easily one of the greatest rpg games of recent times. i highly recommend playing this if, for some ungodly reason, youve yet to do so.",1
"what i wanted from this game was the modern experience of the text dungeons and dragons that i experienced many moons ago. well, i got that and more. there are various roles that you are invited to play in the form of quests. the main being dragon slaying. you discover during the quest that you aredragonborn and can absorb the very soul of any dragon that you slay. this is quite spectacular. later you are imbued with special powers called, shouts that need these dragon souls to activate them. in some of the quests there are some moral choices of the kind a person may not like to make in real life and sometimes, in order to continue the quest to its fullest you must make the, bad choice. its that aspect that i personally do not like. it was, buggy when i first got it with some bugs stopping progress and although most have now been remedied there are still a few left. the longer in the game, the load times increased between the scenes and for startup. i enjoyed playing this game and couldnt wait for the dlc.",2
"great combat system and really fun mods exist for this game that has some amazing name recognition.",2
"i got a lot of hours out of skyrim. its simple fun that has a lot of content. unfortunately, looking back on it, it was ultimately somewhat of a let down. you are presented with an ocean of possibility, but in reality this ocean is barely a foot deep. the combat is shallow and clunky. mods give the game more playability, but the base game is unsatisfying if youre looking for something more.",1
"gut game, much fun, best game evar, buy naow, serious though..",1
"freezed a chicken with a spell in the middle of the village and got gangraped by guards and villagers! 10/10",1
"basically an action game, where you try to find and kil whatever has a white arrow on the top.",1
"this game is well made with many things to keep you entertained!! the graphics are outstanding and every fight is a joy so i would highly recommend this game.",1
"i am extremely unhappy with this game insofar as i cannot get past the character creation bug irrespective of whether i shut off my firewall. i have no mods, none. the computer, from asus gamer republic, should play this game like a dream. i intensely resent the fact that what is paid for does not work. i have puchased every game from this software company since its inception. yes, i am that old. after waiting years for the bugs to be worked out, it appears my patience was for naught. i am removing the game from my computer and will not be back.",1
"i cannot describe how epic this game is... even after more then a yeah its graphics (including mods) are amazing",1
"its skyrim and even though this game came out in 2011 mods are keeping it going if you are thinking about getting it this summer sale just do it.",2
"okay on its own, great with mods. on its own it has a good story, although gameplay can get very boring at high levels. the expansions seem to be made as endgame content, they are much more difficult from the standard game, but still just as well-made. the workshop (and nexus mods) are what really make this game great, if you can imagine it, its probably a mod for this game.",1
"with mods this game has limitless replayablility, definitely worth buying if youre into rpgs.",1
"terrible, terrible movement (input) lag the likes of which ive never seen on any other game in my library. ive searched high and low for fixes, but have come up with nothing. said lag makes the game bothersome and unenjoyable to play. may consider picking this back up again if i can ever manage to find the fix.",1
"great rpg, go where you want, kill who you want, steal what you want. the quest are great with a good story behind it (i dont do alot of story lines, not really a fan in any game). the combat seems like an improvement from previous elder scroll games. magic is fun to play around with but ill always use my trusty bow, the aim is right on, just hard to hit them flying dragons. skills are done nicely, if your an archer type, using bows alot, and wanna try 2 hand weapons, you dont have to make a new character, just start using 2 hand weapons with your archer and youll gain skill. since there is level ramping (enemies in the world level and scale up compared to what level you are) when you switch to using 2 hand weapons, you will notice a damage differance, but just keep using youll get your skill where it needs to be soon enough. its easy to get lost in doing side quest from the main story, as they randomly generate. over all, if you like alot of the elder scrolls and/or fallout series, youll love this. 9/10",2
"if you kill a chicken, you better take the witnesses with you.",1
"fun filled action packed and great stories. the lot of them. tons of side missions that are fun and deep. great crafting systemwith tons of mods. i can think of anyone who wouldnt enjoy this game at least a little.",1
"quite good, i love the interactive storyline and the lovely open world. (8.6/10) you gotta join the companions, some dope campaign theyve got. if you decide to buy this game, buy heartfire dlc too, allows you to build your own house, design it as you wish and adopt up to two children. hell of a fun.",1
"its skyrim. it came out in 2011 on the 10/11/11 (broken release date) hated it at first; too much like fallout 3 for an elder scrolls game i thought. fast travel a few years later and i seem to quite like the game, dont know what happened. i still prefer oblivion but hey, its the elder scrolls, the series has been going on now for 20 years, you know what your getting in to. 8/10",1
"skyrim is ...how can i put this into words...you just cant but ill try. to call it a video-game is an insult. super mario brothers is a video-game grand theft auto is a video-game quake is a video-game skyrim ....skyrim is an entity ,a spirit that haunts your thoughts and dreams for the rest of your life , a living ,breathing world in a league of its own. life is more of a game than skyrim. -oxytrebor",1
"this game will never die, if you never played it youre lame :)",1
"one of the most amazing games of our generation. buy it now.",1
"this game is perhaps one of the most comprehensive, vast, and expansive games i have ever played. throughout my journey through the world of skyrim, searching through nordic wastelands, crawling through massive dungeons, and completing wonderful questlines, i felt utterly involved, and absorbed into the game. this is a game i very happily paid $60 for, and would highly reccomend it to anyone whos played an rpg similar to this in the past, or even just people who havent, but would like to know what the epitome of an rpg may be. this has been my favorite game to play through, and i dont regret a second of gameplay.",1
"best game ive ever played. very good storyline, and very good mods. a must have!",5
"thig game never ends, has huge replayability, and if you think you saw everything, thats where mods come in , a pro tip though: be very careful with mods i highily recommend you take only very well endorsed mods, and read everything about their compataility and the load order, if you want the game to roll with no problems.",1
"i already own this game on xbox 360 which i brought as soon as it came out and loved every second of it. i recently brought it on pc and was disappointed at first as it was crashing, however when i found out it was a corrupted save and i fixed it i have had no problems and highly recommend buying it simply for mods, the way it looks on pc and unlimted hours of exploring the huge map of skyrim. 9/10",1
"one of the better rpgs of all time. worth triple what youll pay for it. play with mods. lose hundreds of hours.",1

"epic rpg! whats more important is that steam workshop makes installing mod become very easy and safety.",1
"this is one of those games where you think crack would be less addicting. ive wasted hours of my life playing this game and i think it was worth it! this is easily one of the best games ive ever played!, there are tons of workshop items, dlcs, and most of all, fun to be had! i really recomend picking up this game if you have too much time on your hands. dont be afraid to try oblivion either, its not as good in my opinion but its still a pretty good game.",1
"tis game is !! xd its like obvlivion sexcept its got 0 fun! all of teh npcs are super stupid and give no good items at all ce[t the quest ones and their items arent that ogood itehr im still wearing starting gaer cuz i cant find anyhin good! my rocmommendation for this game?: to go be a bad game on consle only! pc ftw xd",2
"i love skyrim. i love the mod community, i love the open nature of the game. your exprince is what you make of it.",1
"great visuals and mechanics but can get a bit repetitive.",1
"got for the 360 and couldnt resist and got for computer as well. never had a better time than moding and having fun on pc",1
"skyrim is a amazing game you wil never embark on a more epic adventure in any other game. skyrim is a game of choice thinking and much more to really understand this game you need to let go of your logic science and all the other crap that might make you think that is not possible well guess what it is in tamriel a place of magic and where there is magic anything is possable in this game your only thing you can trust i your weapion. in this game choice is everything and trust me you will make good and bad choices. but how you make them is your choice. and remember dovahkin i took an arrow to the knee....",1
"well. it doesnt get much more thu-umingly good than this. skyrim in pc is a waterfall of fun - the game itself boasts a 94 in the metascore, and theres so damn much to be getting on with in skyrim! the atmospheric views and daunting enemies make this game cash-worthy, and the ability so shout - rather loudly - as a dragon can is pretty unique, and brings skyrim to the table as a worthy rpg contender. graphics? theyre a little demanding, but the ultra settings are a different story - bringing the best graphics to an rpg ive ever seen. such a good game - especially with mods. brilliant. buy it. be the dragonborn.",2
"even though it didnt quite deliver the experience it advertised, skyrim was still one of the better games in the past 10 years- particularly so on steam, where you can have a blast modding it. i recommend fancy mudcrabs.",1
"one of the best games ive played , lots of treasures to find , houses to buy , artifacts to get , you can do what you want , find mods that you would like to use to make the game even better and the gameplay and graphics is awesome!!!!.the only thing about the game thats not so cool is bugs , the worst thing that can happen too you is if you get a bug , hard to fix , should try and do it with the console i did it already and it worked thanks guys catch ya later",1
"great game its really fun and missions are actually good and some are quite hard but more intresting and its quite good to use the shout power and speed power just got to earn them by finding some wrting thing on the wall when ur doing ur mission u get a new power and u can upgrades skills to use u can smith armor if u cant look or find good armor. you can get heavy armor and light armor but and u can get daedric armor whitch is best in the game or dragon armor they got good armor ratings but u need high level heavy armor to smith them and if u get light armor u can get nightingale armor whitch gives good picklocking good sneaking more stamina and stuff but not as much armor ratings ....... by pressing *tab*....",1
"if a man came into my house,  me, killed my family,  me again, went into the future and aborted my children, and then came back and shot me in the kneecaps i would hate him less than this game. please. save yourself. dont do it.",2
"do i recomed this game yes this is one of the best games i have ever played and still am playing it never gets boring with all the new mods u can get and the main quest and it looks amazing when you are standing on the throat of the world looking over skyrim recomendation yes!!!!!",2
"among the best open world games ive played so far. it provides many hours of exploration, combat and questing. this is one of those games that is finished. it is done. you buy it and you have a great game. plenty of patches have come out by now and polished it to bring you an epic adventure. its also one of those games where dlcs add content to an already great game instead of stripping the game and reselling the parts as dlc. so although you dont need dlc, for those wanting more skyrim its a great option. the modding community provides a lot of content for free as well. many gameplay elements can be altered to your wishes. its a time sink. be warned.",2
"one of the greatest games ever released. if ure into fantasy role playing adventures ... no need to say anything more about it. ive spent a lot of time in this world of fantasy and exploring, get this - now.",2
"a game one never grows tired of, there is a extremely wide world to wander and if you feel like making the game more fun you can buy the other dlcs which makes the game even better. you feel like a real beast when you walk around fighting whatever comes in your way. love it",1
"a great way to waste a few months and if your lucky you wont end up with as many broken quests as me",1
"mine bugs out at the start loading screen its depreassing when you have waited all that time to update and bam it doesnt work oh also my lego marvel super heros is the same",1
"that game was awesome till i took an arrow to the knee :c i will get the dlcs for sure !!!!!!",1
"10% of time doing quests 10% of time travelling 80% of time shouting at lydia for being in my way...",1
"well... its skryim. the elder scrolls: skyrim. buy this game.",1
"by dis gaem if u liek de dragons and magic shoutingz. also i am a lizaerd and my wifu is a lady. she does the beastiality on me but i don caer she is so kawaii i also installed nood mod and had sex wiv her!",1
"i cannot recommend this enough, this game is amazing. if you are willing to put some time into this you wont regret it.",1
"oh my god... how much content can you cram into a game!? my completionist streak kicks in after a few hours and i suffer total brain failure, as i try to track too many quests and objectives, while simultaneously deliberately not advancing the plot, in case i miss anything. it results in complete nervous system collapse and i then have to start all over again. still... an absolutely brilliant game (though get some good mods for it!).",1
"killed a chicken, got murdered by town guards. saw a guard arrest a fish. pacifist shopkeeper killed a dragon with his bear fists. carried 350 pounds of cheese. ate all the cheese. put a human heart in a random persons pocket so they can find it later. get this game 9,259,428,752,098 / 10",2
"this is an awesome game and i would recomend it to anyone. 5 star game",1
"awesome rpg, great exploration and so much fun to find random things to do when exploring, would recommend just exploring and then adding mods like mad.",1
"everybody knows what this is. i feel like some elements of combat made killing people too easy as the game went on - im looking at you sneak - but fun either way. looks great on max settings and the storyline is pretty good.",1
"the game is fantastic! there really isnt much to say if you even know bethesda softworks and the elder scrolls franchise is.",1
"i shouldnt have to recommend this. if you dont own this, youre an idiot.",1
"one of the best, especially once you get into modding!",1
"wow. so many quests. so many thing to do, its overwhelming at times! one of my favorite games of all time, hands down.",1
"if you are a fan of the elder scrolls series then you will definitely want to pick up skyrim. this game has a lot to offer in terms of storyline, side quests, exploration and customization. players will be forced to take part in a violent civil war that will split brother against brother and friend against friend. magic, alchemy, enchantments and dragon shouts are all pretty straight forward in terms of mechanics and players new to the series will have very little difficulty getting into the swing of things. the graphics and textures are all absolutely stunning with rivers, mountains, valleys, farms, streams, caves, dungeons and dragons popping out at you everywhere you turn. once again, bethesda has delivered a masterpiece and in doing so, has set the bar extremely high for the elder scrolls series! pros + excellent storyline +player customization +endless exploration +beautiful graphics and landscapes +steam workshop mods cons +dungeons can sometimes feel a bit laggy, even on a high-end pc. +some elements such as alchemy, enchantments and magic feel a bit watered down compared to previous elder scrolls titles. warnings this game is meant to be enjoyed as a single player campaign and offers no multiplayer experience. conclusion i would definitely recommend this game to my friends!",1
"if you have free time i dont advise buying this game. youll no longer have free time.",1
"a brilliant game that i have owned on x-box for years",1
"amazing 10 out of 10 i would say been playing the elder scrolls series for so long i love this game",1
"one of my favorite games. it has some of the most amazing mods.",1
"awesome game and great mods on the workshop total win that is all",1
"a really nice game that people will be playing for a long time.",1
"finally was able to get this game for pc and i forgot what sunlight looks like. 10/10 would get lost again.",2
"i still have not finished the main quest. 10/10 would play again.",1
"ing  game absolute crap waste of 2000 oh wait chuck testa",2
"as you can tell, i really enjoy skyrim. skyrim is a an rpg for the regular player, as it has some rpg elements, but anyone can pick up this game. another thing that stands out about this game is the great modding community. with thousands of mods, theres something good for everyone. tes:v is three years old, but with the amazing modding community, its still fresh. skyrim also has a great soundtrack by jeremy soule, and the four cd soundtrack is worth the price. however, there are some downsides. skyrim crashes, quite a bit. but if you can fix it using mods or just sticking to the normal game, its fantastic. 98/100.",4
"i, as a dragonborn, cannot waste my time to write this  review. i gotta go to kill those dragons and honor my guild!",1
"excellence in gaming for sure. could always be improvements, i.e. buying and selling w/o repeating dialogue and imagination in this on-going process; marriage and outfits partners wear; housing (better in hearthfire dlc); non-repeating dialogues once said; for all games better rewards at the end demanding imagination from the developers in this multi-million/billion dollar enterprise. all in all though, this is an excellent game.",5
"skyrim takes all the good stuff (and a lot of the broken stuff!) from oblivion and improves on it. a bombastic, open, fun rpg. go hunt deer, craft potions and hit bandits in the face with a big axe. and dont forget the infinite dragons!",2
"awesome game but gets really boring and turns into a mass grind.",1
"made a girl with big boobs. made her wear ty armor. kill dragons. 10/10 would play again.",1
"after 500+ hours of this game (not all on steam... shhhhhhhhh), i am still finding things that i have never found before. i have probably hit that new game button nearly 10 times now and invested an unhealthy amount of hours into playing them, and i am only now getting into the modding community. i have to say that it is probably my favourite game of all time (and also my most played.) bethesda have made something here that will go down in history. 10/10",1
"this is probably the best single player rpg i have ever played. get it!",1
"pros: -looks pretty -big cons- -shallow quests/shallow guilds. theres no ranking up in guilds. you are automaticly the most talented person in the guild! -lesser customization than previous titles -hard coded key binds. good one bethesda! -hot key system is overly complicated and burdensome. -terrible menu system. i love sorting through huge lists to find something i need on the fly. large amount of screen real estate is wasted on a preview image of the item. -lackluster perk system/silly leveling system. why are there even perks, like really? this is an elder scrolls game. -90% of the people have the same voice actor. -no more acrobatics? -immersion is shattered by all the stuff above. -(ran out of room for cons.) it would have been a decent game if it was just another game. but this is an elder scrolls game. it has a legacy to uphold. almost all rpg elements have been stripped in favor for more action feeling. it is hollow. 64/100",1
"game of the year 2011. it would take me days to think of all the things you can do in this game, but here are the some of the major features. explore a huge map, join factions, slay dragons, hunt, customize your character, engage in combat with bandits, animals/mysterious creatures, mages, etcetera, develop your dragonborn into the strongest being in all of tamriel, and much, much more. if you enjoyed oblivion and previous elder scrolls games, you will fall in love with skyrim.",2
"elder scrolls is not the best game beacause after a while youll probably notice it is sucking up a lot of your time. this is just my opinion so dont say  about this review and the game itself is pretty annoying and bad beacause there are so many glitches in the game for some people its annoying but other people think its funny but i dont so if you dont want a game that sucks up your time dont buy it i hate this game even with mods its not fun but other people think not but if your still playing this look around your room and yourself and think about it",2
"ever watch the hauntingly beautiful flight of an arrow as it buries itself in slow motion into the ear of a bandit standing 100 feet away? no? then play this game.",2
"me? explain this game? well, thats difficult because i cannot. this game is so good, that (when i finally beat it.) i gave it a standing ovation.",1
"great elder scrolls, one of the best single player rpgs out there",1
"very goood. i higry reccomed this game. its riterarry the best game ever",1
"all the fun of previous elder scrolls, but you dont need a spreadsheet to plan you skills.",2
"this game is the best. replayed 4 times, still the best game ever",1
"to be honest, i never was a fan of skyrim, and never will. i mean it is a good game, open world sandbox, and you can running around doing stuff. but the thing is, i have no idea what the hell im playing, am i doing this right? where should i go? why the quest tells me to go back the place i just got out? did i missed something? overall, i think im more like a dragon age -type of player, a solid storyline really means a lot to me.",1
"i can shout at a dinner party and watch as people and food go flying. a++",1
"one of the most beautiful and immersive rpgs ive ever experienced, skyrim has alot to offer to gamers, ranging from casual players to hardcore rpg fanatics alike. you are the dovahkiin, the dragonborn, destined for great things, good or bad, in the land of skyrim. with a main story line and four side story lines in the base game alone, this game will constantly entertain you with a near endless supply of adventure... not to mention the support for mods and the offical bethesda downloadable content.",3
"this game is quite good. the story is believable (for a magic and monsters story). it really gives you choice about what to do, as a lot of bethesda games nowadays do. the thing that would make this game better would be a little more variety in weather. i know that the province of skyrim is home of the nords and they come from a cold place, but by the end of the game you want to finish so you dont have to look at snow and gray all the time. its a rather bleak affair. even so, this game is a great one especially with the modding community doing so much to help improve the game. highly recommended.",1
"this game is great for people who love to just go and do whatever they want in a video game. the vast ammounts of quests and dungeons to complete is astounding. you can even run around and just kill everything if you want to. you can complete assasinations and get gold for doing. you can smith your own weapons and buy weapons from other people the possibilities with the elder scrolls v: skyrim are endless. i dont recommend this game for young children to play or watch as it is quite bloody and gory. there is a slight ammount of language but the worst of it is d**n. the rating is for sexual themes but after playing the game for 65 hours i have found no sexual themes in the game. i recommend the game for anyone over the age of 15. you dont have to have a high end computer to play this game either. i have a mediocre computer that will play on medium graphics very well. the graphics even on medium are astounding. overall, this game is amazing and i have enjoyed every minute of it.",1
"literally one of the best games ive played in a long while. you can play it over and over and youll find something new to see or do. i love the storyline and the different quests you can partake in. the graphics are truly stunning. the amount of mods you can download makes it even better. i have nothing negative to say, other than youll lose hours and hours of your life to this game. :<",1
"good ol skrim. never fails to deliver an unimaginable level of junk to collect and dragons to kill. comically though, despite all its awesomeness, it cant quite compare to sex.",1
"great game with no class restrictions on your abilities. want to be better with bows? shoot more! better with swords? stick em with the pointy end! better armor? take a beating! pro tip - chickens are snitches.",1
"it will most probably be my most favourite game for ever !!! open-world game where you can be pretty much everything and everyone. if you find yourself with nothing more to do, you can just mod your game with lot of awesome mods, which are easy to install. its fun to play it over and over anyway. in my opinion its the best game yet.",4
"this game is one of the best rpg i`ve ever played !",1
"extremely absorbing gameplay and great visuals make this a winner, there is so much to do in this game that youll never get bored!",2
"if you are a fan and vivid player of bethesda games and or just the elder scrolls saga this is a wonderfull chapter in the saga and to the bethesde genre, its a must play with its open world fantasy along with that rpg element that only bethesda can give you.",1
"my friend told me he didnt like the elder scrolls v: skyrim two weeks later he got hit by a taxi... three weeks later i lost my taxi license...",1
"i thought i was really addicted to this game with the mere number of hours ive clocked into the game... i guess im really just starting my adventure now...",1
"i was going to write a recommendation for this game, but then i took an arrow to the knee.",1
"started out as a prioner with no money about to be decapitated. proceeds to play many hours levelling my character and slaying dragons. gets caught stealing a sweet role. is now a prisoner with no money. improvement from the start of the game as head is not being removed. turns head to clock and realises should have been in school 2 weeks ago. proceeds to play another 10 hours. 10/10 would waste life again. bury me with my alduin statue.",1
"this is the most complete and emmersive game i have ever had the pleasure to play, the graphics are spectacular even before the mods, the gameplay is smooth and decisive, there is over a hundred hours of game play and plenty of different classes and avenues to go down, to keep you busy for months, or like me whos time is a little more precious, years. 9.9/10",2
"you can take a bee out of a beehive and put it in ur inventory it doesnt even fight back and u can eat it just eat the bee eat the h*cking bee",1
"skyrim is more than just a game, its an complete experience of a open world game can be. 10/10",1
"all the hype, over rated game got to lvl 5 and gave up, boring game.",1
"get this game. it is the closest thing you will ever find to a never ending game. between the game itself and the amount of mods put out on the nexus and steam you can build a almost perfect game time and again. so buy it, play it, love it. you will not be let down.",2
"skyrim is still a fantastic game to come back to and start a new character every now and then. first i was a wood elven archer, then a dark elf arcane mage and now ive started a new campaign in which i play an orc. each of these play styles almost takes you through a whole new game. i recommend this game to anyone who loves to roam large uncharted territories as a fantastical being of their making; and meet a lot of diverse ai which might come to help you in one story line or battle you in another!",1
"great game; lots of in-depth content; im up to 700 hours played now so ive definitely gotten my moneys worth. good dlc, good player created content, and lots of different ways you can play your character through the game if you want to change things up your next time through. be an archer this time instead of a magic user or vice versa. lots of fun even if you didnt play the earlier elder scrolls series games.",3
"one of the best games i have ever played. 200 plus hours of fantasy fun.",1
"if you are looking to lose yourself in game forever then i would recommend this game. the game alone is amazing with so many different things to do and with how you can develop how you wish to play.",1
"social life destorying, life ruining , time wasting game of the year doesnt matter still yelled at dragons till it dies 10/10",1
"the best game for a long time. its a game. you can play it again and again even without commutys mods. if you havent played skyrim yet (omg, is it even possble???) take your money from the wallet and put this game to your game library right now! oh. my. god. 1010, 1010!!!",1
"an impressive immersive jaw dropping experience. this game is any free-form rpgers dream.",2
"run around as a crazy swede (or cat-man) high on sugar killing romans in a land were it is always a diferent season a few clicks away. and this is in the vanilla game, no mods. now with mods the posibilites are endless.",1
"one of the best games ever. this game should be in anyones collection. great visuals, great story, high replay value. thanks to the large amount of mods in the steam workshop you can just keep on playing!",2
"ive died too many times from murdering chickens and then getting my  handed to me from 30 guards kfc/10",1
"with all of the add ons and dlc this is an awesome game.",1
"one of my all time favorite games, get it if you want to have a great adventure that you can tackle in a number of ways.",3
"its skyrim, you either love it or hate it. pc version is best with all the various mod options with an extremely active modding community since release.",1
"amazing game! right up until the very end, it was interesting. i was also able to mod the game easily, giving it a very realistic feel and look, as well as improving some gameplay kinks in the final release. great game!",1
"all around amazing, awesome free roam and mechanics.",1
"10/10 the game that should be owned by every steam user. bought it for 5 dollars, best decision of the year. whats more is, you can mod the hell out of this game, just like every elder scrolls game before this.",2
"best game ever. especially with mods installed to boost your textures. skyrim is just beautiful",1
"not really sure what im err.. supposed to write about skyrim here, i mean seriously its skyrim. if you dont own it yet, your hopes for half-life 3 have completely consumed your life... not like thats a bad thing but seriously skyrim, buy it before the 6th one comes out.",1
"this game is byfar the best game i have ever played! i give it a 10/10",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. i recommend this game if still dont have it.",1
"what can one say about a series like elder scrolls. yes it has plenty of frustations but in the end it is an amazing game of our generation and thankfully for pc players there is a legion of modders out there contently making the game more playable every day. highly recommended",3
"the perfect game to make an epic journey. will suit many playstyles and player preferences, and most likely even excel it in the process. of course i recommend it, its obviously one of the best rpgs ever out there! p.s.: ...just installed it again and played for like 4 hours without a break. damn it, its so immersive!",1
"one of the greatest games of all time. it sure earned those 200 goty awards. (game of the year)",4
"i take a cloth from dead bandit, then fap it. 69/10",2
"awesome game and plenty of gameplay hours. together with the dlcs i have played 115 hours and ive almost finished all main quests /story lines.",1
"saw a horse kill a dragon. 11/10 would watch again!",1
"i greatly enjoyed the game and its has amazing replay value because of the modding community",2
"skyrim has to be one of the most epic (and i mean that in large proportions as well as completely awesome) games that i have ever played. there is a deep sense of immersion to be found, hours upon hours of gameplay (especially if you create multiple characters) and a near endless supply of awesome mods to keep you going. only things i dont like: buggy as ill get out, although not unplayably so. just ask someone about the horses. dragon combat is a bit lacking the sneak skill is freaking broken you can one shot bosses if you arent on the harder difficulties lets fight even more dragur! also, please get a dlc, at least one, and hearthfire doesnt count. they are both good, get one, get both, heck get legendary edition if you want and have them all, but please get one of them. they add so much to the game. all in all, id say 9/10. great game :d",3
"skyrim might seem like a game that gets boring when you cant find a scroll and you think youve went through every hidden cave in the map. but you can always kill dragons, and other monsters that are harder than the mobs you fight in those caves. it may seem to dull but if you just mod it a little bit. bam! you get a game that is worth more than $20!! mods will make the game as good as your favorite game that you have on steam. but trust me, this is recommended. 10/10",1
"i use to play skyrim on the console then i got a pc. some may ask was it worth it< having already owned a game to buy it again? i answer them yes. skyrim on the console was great the open world, the graphics, hell even the chickens that sent you to jail. but skyrim on the pc, well thats a new level of awesome. not only do you get the same things as you get on the console, but mods on top of that, which can increase the replay value ten-fold, and skyrims replay value was nearly unlimited to begin with.",1
"skyrim alone is a great game. its a really fun, sandbox action rpg with a ton of content that tells a great story. where it really shines is the community supplied mods through steam workshop or skyrim nexus. some mods range from simple weapon and armor retexturing to whole new zones and quests.",2
"buy this game and go get lost in the world of skyrim. its truly one of the best rpgs iv ever played. its a living world and amazing game.",1
"mod it till it crash, then set your boot order and mod some more.",1
"has to be one of the most amazing games i have ever played i have it on the ps3 and cpu love it on both.",1
"easy checklist for potentially liking this game. 1. do you like standard epic fantasy? 2. do you dislike action bars and button mashing? 3. have you ever wanted to hear americans butchering a fake norse accent? 4. do you have an inexplicable urge to steal everything from anyone that isnt nailed down? 5. have you ever wondered what a horse would look like defying physics? if you answered yes to at least one of the above, then i would recommend watching some videos on youtube of people playing this and then judge for yourself.",3
"you can do a quest where you get drunk with a demon and find out the next day that you stole someones wedding ring and pet goat, after meeting a hagraven and having drunk sex with it....... what more is there that you need 10/10 best rpg ever",1
"skyrim: most addictive game ever, i spent 3 hole days playing this game with out stoping and i havent even scrached the surface of this game yet, i highly recomend this game to people who like games were they chose how there charcter looks, the abilitys he can use and who they side with, this game is probably the best game i have ever played and i will continue to play this game until i die",1
"the elder scrolls is one of my favorite rpg series and skyrim is no disappointment. an open ended world, great voice acting, deep character customization, solid gameplay mechanics and the freedom to pursue the kind of character you want to play make this a choice game for any fans of action rpgs and there has always been a great community surrounding the series with talented modders who take the game to a completely different level, creating a deeply replayable experience.",3
"a really nice game that you can have almost can do anything in the game",1
"this game is amazing! there is so much to do so it is so easy to pour time into it. you dont even need to play any of the others to already be hooked on it and be immersed in the story. it is a very mod friendly game which has countless mods that can provide minor enhancements or total game changes that always keep things fresh. over two years after its release there are still dedicated modders who continue to provide more content and improvements that still make the game very playable today.",1
"skyrim holds many adventures, and amazing gameplay. i only wish it would last longer.",1
"i am at a loss for words of the sheer size and scope of this game (not even mentioning mods) in total a 10,000/10 in my opinion a near perfect game.",3
"it was ok. for some reason i like oblivion alot more the music from oblivion i thought was better i also thought it was a more interesting story so i reccomend trying oblivion first then try this. and the dragonborn dlc was very interesting. and i have only played oblivion on xbox 360 if you wondering why i dont have it on steam.",1
"the game is very fun and the community is also active a lot.",1
"this game is full of beauty, from the lakes, to the caverns, to the villages. it is full of wildlife, some scary, most not. sidequests are very plentiful, and it seems there is always something to do either fun, or dangerous. even though i have no gotten very far in this game, i would still highly reccomend it. if you get the game, have fun :d",1
"my favorite game comany. skyrim is a single player first person adventure game with soooo much to do, the only downside is after a very long time playing it becomes repetitve same foes same looking caves and same looking castles.",1
"i killed a chicken..... and got wanted on a town for it.... 10/10",1
"i spent countless hours in tamriel, bethesda made a great game, even though it was not near perfect, the modding community made skyrim into one of the best rpgs in recent years, if somethings is not like you want it? mod it. if there is something that cant be modded in skyrim, try another bethesda game, someone even managed to mod fallout: nv to have working cars! without mods: 7.6 with mods: 9.1",2
"great game. ive already spent a good 80+ hours on it and ive barely scratched the surface. lots of exploring to be done, lots of quests to be quested, lots of epic times to be had.",1
"skyrim is one of the most addicting games i have ever played. it does a great job of combining fantasy with northern europe of the middle ages. i recommend skyrim to everybody.",1
"best game ive ever played. completed the main quests and both expansions in roughly 140 hrs. of game play without getting bored. id even love playing it again but with a different type of character. i will find time to do it one day haha",1
"havent logged many hours on pc, but had to buy it since it was on sale. if you havent played this. you should probably reconsider your life.",1
"who need thief games when you can steal guards clothes without them being noticed. 10/10",1
"i gotta say i am a big elder scrolls fan but skyrim is beyond perfect.i played about 50 hours in the last 2 weeks and i love it so much.this game has got sooo much replay value and is my favs rpg of all time.i mean in which game can you be a werewolf,buy houses.adopt children,marry,buld houses,ride a motherf***ing dragon,fight dragons absorb their souls,unlock shouts,smith weaponsand more,yeah you guessed it skrim.oh ,yeah and be a vampire lord.i freakin loovvee this game.sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo awesooommmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeee!!!!",1
"dang this game is the perfect i-want-to-go-and-kill-things game and the story is pure gold but there one or two bugs but who gives when you can kill dragons and kill the heck out of a whole village as a vampire or were-wolf!!!!",1
"it worth to play n good way to explore fantacy world.....",1
"saw the game bought the game died too many times with a  axe, went to the workshop,got a plasma gun then suddenly i become the overlord of skyrim. plasma gun is love, plasma gun is life. 10/10 would get more from the workshop again",1
"terrible morrowind clone that cant even do an old early 2000 game well and this came out recently too!",1
"best game ever. you like dragons you like action you will enjoy this game as mch as i did. on my secound playthrough",1
"this is the best game that i currently have on my computer. if you have the money, buy it immediately. you will not regret it for a second.",1
"my favorite game of all time. this game really throws you in a world where you can be what you want to be.",1
"this game is perfect if you dont have a life. seriously amazing.",1
"as i write this, only 117 hrs on record. one of the most entertaining of the elder scrolls series as far as exploring and finding new things at every turn. i still miss daggerfall (they need to bring back ships, improve spell creation, etc.) and it feels like skyrim has fewer things to loot than oblivion... but with the right mods this game is superb. id say this makes my top 10 list but with a few crippling bugs and with some need for improvement on the crafting/skill/balance area, it will stay toward the bottom of that list for now.",1
"hundreds of hours of gameplay. not much else is needed to be said.",2
"its a old game, and its image quality is not the best(without dlc), but i still love it.",1
"thsi game is one of the best ones that you will ever play, it is an essenial game and you will spend days wondering why it wasnt in you life before hand",3
"why am i bothering to review this game? its great. we all know its great. but its more than that. tes:v skyrim is the ultimate timesink, capable of drawing you in for hours on end. having spent around 400 hours ingame, i have yet to complete even all of the vanilla content, or any of the dlc! on top of that there is a ridiculous amount of top quality mods in the steam workshop and nexus. the combat remains a bit floaty, but easily remedied by aforementioned mods. the world is vast and varied, from green plains to snowstorm plagued mountains to dark draugr dens. the vanilla game, along with the hd textures provided by bethesda is already incredibly detailed, but when combined with texture mods and enbs, becomes breathtakingly beautiful. skyrim is a game crafted with love. cant wait for the next installment!",3
"playing skyrim is like driving drunk, you never know when youre gonna crash.",2
"some noble came up to me and said do you get to the cloud district very often? oh what an i saying of course you dont. hes dead now",1
"it was fine game i likea the modding. you should buy rigt now sort of",1
"fair warning, if you get this game you wont want to leave your pc for a long time. who needs a life when you are a master mage and swordsman.",2
"skyrim hardly needs a recommendation, but here goes: i have always liked the elder scrolls games, but i havent always liked playing the elder scrolls games. i still have my boxed copies of arena and daggerfall, and memories of endless patching. i never got anywhere much in morrowind, and oblivion just kind of lost me. skyrim expertly tickles that lizard part of my brain that likes exploration. no matter how much you wander -- and 40 of my 48 hours in-game have been wandering -- theres still something new to see, guaranteed. i havent even been to three of the major towns of skyrim yet. ive walked past countless towers, ruins, fortresses and caves. my journal is full of abandoned quests i wish i could move to a seperate section so i never felt a twinge about well, maybe, since i said yes, i should go and do that. and yet still i want to wander and find more stuff to do. i think this must be what crack cocaine is like. later edit: definitely not crack cocaine because suddenly, 58 hours or so in, my brain decided: nope! dont want to do this any more! and i stopped. still, how many games do i ever play for almost 60 hours? none, thats how many.",1
"skyrim is the tale of a hero who by luck escapes an untimely death and lives on to go on heroic and not-so-fantastic quests. ive had skyrim on and off since its release in 2012, and its beauty and the uniqueness for each character you create has made it one of my favorite games. of course it cant be perfect, but i recommend this game to anyone that loves rpgs.",1
"elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the greatest games i ever played and have never put as much time on any other game as skyrim. get it you wont be disappointed!",1
"why do i even have to? its an elder scrolls game and its skyrim? need i say more? i do? well then ill say this, fus roh dah!",5
"there is a plethera of content that has kept me engaged and craving more since ive started playing. anyone who has a decent computer and an urge to adventure must buy this game.",1
"easily the best bethesda game made yet, very solid and massive rpg. its about the same size as morrowind but because of the mountanious terrain it takes 3x as long to get anywhere. random dragon battle are one of the best parts of the game. few bugs for a beshesda game starting out i was impressed.",1
"has a lot of bugs, but they come to be warm and memorable quirks to the game. the graphics can be amazing or pretty garbage depending on what kind of system you run...the graphics were coded inefficiently so it takes quite a tank to get up to the real beauty skyrim has to offer. the modding community is amazing and keeps this game thriving with new ideas, new adventures, and new mechanics that you probably wouldnt have even imagined. but they can be really great and fun to just explore. all in all, skyrim is an awesome game. you might play it for just a little while, or for an insanely long time as i have, but i can guarantee that no matter how much you decide to put into skyrim it will be a memorable and most likely enjoyable experience.",2
"what can be said that hasnt already been said? you can sink tons of time into the game and get absolutely nothing done. there is no shortage of beautiful scenery or battles, and exploration is addicting. fighting draugr does get repetitive after a while, but the loot is generally worth it. spending 100+ hours in game isnt unheard of, and any game that you still find yourself wanting to play after that amount of time definitely deserves a place in your library. excellent game, 9.5/10",1
"one of the greatest games i have ever played. it is just so fun to play and explore.",1
"good game. (i also love how the trailers characters armor sucks)",1
"cool game good graphics adicting, what more do you need?",1
"an okay screensaver where you can pass time by suplexing bandits. wait there was a story???",1
"dont worry if you think you cant run it, just go get the ulg mod and the framerate limiter mod and you can basically play it on any system. anyways the game is ing awesome",1
"with as many hours as i have on record any words in saying this game is good is meaningless, but here it is. its a great game. its controls are good, im never like dang it the controls screwed me. theres a few bugs, but they are few are far between compared to the amount of content there is. the soundtrack, voice acting is good, if not great. in theory its an open world action rpg, in truth its really what you want it to be. you want to be lead by the nose and go where the major quests take you, want to say screw all the quests, and just clear out a dungeon because youre a serial killer, want to join the bard college and just travel around with out really doing much of anything? well the game lets you do all of those or none.",1
"nice single-player, open world, medieval-aged, fantasy rpg. tons of stuff to do and characters classes variety to explore. recommended to any action rpg fan.",1

"the most epic game ive played in my life. hours and hours of adventures and quests. just amazing!",1
"recommond this game to the people who have are in love with fantasy and also would like to have a world to explore",1
"* killing a chicken by accident and having the whole town after you=priceless! * stealing a plate by accident (yes...)and being the most hunted person in the city=priceless! * caring more about decorating your skyrim house than your rl one=priceless! * getting lost hundreds of times just because youre really bad at reading maps and following plot missions=priceless! * modding this game so bad you dont recognize anything anymore=priceless! * being overwhelmed by the size of the world so much you dont even know where to start=priceless id say go buy it! (but please stay off the chicken =) )",1
"i dont usually play the rpg genre games, but i really enjoyed this one. giant world to explore, many weapons to use and find, many skills to master, many plots to complete. nice graphics and very exiting combat system and stealth system. deep customisation. in short, a great game.",1
"sweet monkey jesus! i worshipped arena. i loved daggerfall. morrowind was wonderful. oblivion couldve been better but the graphics were nice, yknow? skyrim is blowing me away. eeeee! the fun im having. sgood. also, it runs on my netbook, jawsome!",4
"saved the world from dragons then got killed for shouting at a chicken 10/10",1
"i used to have a life like you. then i took a skyrim to the knee.",1
"too much time taken away from me by this game just too much fun i have had playing this game.",1
"once you start playing you cannot stop, and it has the catchiest theme song of all time. i do however wish there were a few more voice actors. 9/10",1
"lord of the rings meets nords simulator 2011. 10/10 would axe to the face again.",1
"i have been playing the elder scrolls v: skyrim for almost two years, thanks to my sister who introduced it to me. as a begining gamer, i would like to make known that i dont like this game for the popularity it has gained, but for the experiences i have had with it. the elder scrolls v: skyrim has always fascinated me with the increasingly complicated storylines that always seem to tie together, and how you can see it effects the gaming realm you live in. for example, during the game, the people are dearly afraid of some sort of prophesy that claims to be the harbingers of the end times, as one guard puts it after one of your first dragon encounters. in these end times, you watch how the civil war rages on, how your encounter with alduin changes everything, and so forth. mainly, i recommend this game because of the intense graphics, the beautiful landscapes you can discover above and below ground, and especially the strange artificats you find throughout your journeys. i recommend this game for people who want the adventures of delving into ruins without leaving their computers, or the ones, like me, who have trouble commiting to a goal and just seem to want to wonder through the land searching for artifacts and more beautiful landscapes to gasp in awe at.",1
"this game is hella fun. it would take years for you to get bored of this game. want to fight thomas the tank engine? theres a mode for that! want to have a pet dragon? theres a mod for that! theres a mod for basically anything you could want to make skyrim your very own game.",1
"pretty average. it has the whole epic feeling going, right up until your 90th journey into a cave. given the nice overworld visuals, youd think they could have more of the actual game take place there. speaking of the overworld, there doesnt feel like theres as much of a reason to just wander like there was in earlier games. going from place to place was more of a chore than a fun little adventure. its weird because so many people complain about fast travel in oblivion because it eliminates the adventure of exploring new stuff, whereas in skyrim it feels like a necessity to avoid the horrible tedium of going from a to b with nothing but scenery porn and caves in between. all in all, if you are so completely unaware that you cant find any better games to play, then feel free to play this. personally, i regret buying it for full price. it might be worth it for like $10.",1
"i definetley like the combat in this game it was really clean loved the way that the story was set out but on thing i didnt like was the choice of characters :(",1
"i know im somewhat late on playing this epic title in the elder scrolls series, but how i now realize how i really missed out. that metascore aint just a number to be put there, it really nails how epic and glorious this huge and emersive game is. the sheer size of the world and the amount of things to do is enormous, not even including the dragonborn dlc or the other dlcs! overall i highly recommend anyone buy this game, and get the dragonborn dlc if you can! 9.6/10",1
"yeah, you need to play this. dragons, magic, giants, spiders and a giant skill tree for every taste. you need to play this.",1
"got a level 31 character on ps3 but that still didnt stop me from getting this for pc as well. if you thought oblivion was good then skyrim is the game for you.",1
"great game.. epic feel to playing the way you want .do what you want. go anywhere. love it",1
"one of the very rare games that is worth its orignal $60 retail price. mods and dlcs add a lot as well. no other single player game will give you hundreds of hours of fun playtime as skyrim does.",1
"love this game its pretty fun and different i like being able to choose my character and have all the stats",1
"epic game, so many options... and great graphics for a rpg!",1
"for anyone looking for a game to sink a couple of hundred hours into skyrims the game for you. good story. fantastic world to explore. tones of content. one of the better rpgs ive played.",1
"what can i say about my favorite game of all time? well you see there are many things to say about it, so lets get started. as a young snaple-mate i used to fall in love with rpg games, now if you havnt live a life like mine...then your life should be boring. now lets talke about the game. skyrim aint no ordinary game, like in the past where people enjoyed playing oblivion only that skyrim is fit for gammers in the 21st century (although you should also play oblivion too its quit fun). now besides all the bugs and glitches, this game can produce quality performance in where every move you make can change the story/quest (although if you die you start from the last save point), but thats not the point, you see even though i dont have much hours from this game i enjoy this rpg on many consols and they basically are the same. but what i am telling you is you should waste your time and money on this game because...of...reasons. look its fun so go and buy it. rate 10/10",1
"super fun. youll play for /many/ hours before you ever get bored of this game.",1
"i wont write long and serious text here like other experts ( or  if u like ). just want to say: orkz iz rokkin!1 p.s. seriously - why the  all ppl choose nords?",2
"i really enjoyed skyrim for about 50 hours, then it all became samey. endless fetch quests, i could kill anyone with two swipes of a battleaxe, it just became tedious. but those first 50 hours were a blast. would recommend it all the same.",1
"dis came is the best game i like it becasuse iga and gmae in farmer like ot and it made my  rock hard iwth all the  and how big they r in other wardz i giv dios game girl maker 2012 10 out of 10 fugzzzz see ya later evary 1",1
"i dont think this game will ever end and i dont want it to. its such a beautiful game!",1
"this game beats the pants of morrowind and oblivion!",1
"awesome graphics: check! incredibly deep sand-box world filled with a nearly endless array of quests: check! tons of weapons and armor: check! rich crafting system: check! possible to roam the countryside as a werewolf: check! ability to command the sky to smite your enemy with a bolt of lightning: check! if you dont already own skyrim, you need to get it! youll easily get your moneys worth out of it.",1
"fun.. as long as you dont mind running around like a headless chicken",2
"for the people who: 1) want depth - a huge story behind every single quest. 2) think the npcs are garbage because they dont react the way the should when the dragonborn does this or that. 3) look for amazing & different ways of combat in order to kill your enemies. 4) think its too repetitieve, shallow, bland dungeon crawler. 5) want to add thousands of mods, not reading how to install them & then complain the game is trash because it crashes. this game is not for you. i enjoy this game very much & i think its a really good game. it all depends on what kind of games you like & if youre too picky. sure, this game is not perfect & has bugs, glitches, etc. but id like to see you developing a game like this or even better. im sure people who dont have high expectations will love the game as much as i do. take your time exploring the places, doing the quests. just add some mods if you need more action, be careful they dont conflict with each other & youre ready to go! (: 8/10",2
"huh hua hwey huh hua hwey dovakin dovakin i punch dragon in shin dova kind dova cruel i must rule skyrim ahhhhhh doooooooooooooovaaaaaaaa tink tink 10/10 why havent you bought it yet?",2
"awesome game with high replayability, especially with all the mods.",1
"its skyrim whats not to love. i find my self going back to this game over and over just to play again and find so many more adventures everytime.",1
"this game is probably one of the best games ive ever played. the amount of choices are infinite and you can shape your character in any way. ive hardly ever experienced glitches, and the gameplay is entertaining. this game will take up hours of your life, and theres so much to do!",1
"i could not stop playing this at at all; best $30 i spent.",1
"well is there something i can say that hasnt been said before, this game is truly amazing! i cannot recommend this game anymore, its just so bloody awesome. the visuals are stunning, the combat is simple to understand yet hard to master, the quests are indepth and engaging. what more could you ask from the rpg genre! so put on some armour, pick up your sword and come join the land of skyrim, long live tamriel! warning: sturdy knee guards are advised!",1
"10/10 good game fight dragon and hit him block to not take damage hit block hit block hit block this game is horrible.",2
"played 50 hours on one save. game glitched on battle of solitude. had to start over. 10/10",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is definitely one of my favourite games. i love open world games, especially the elder scrolls series, and skyrim has one of the best worlds that ive seen. although the dlc does add some great content, skyrim is excellent on its own, and i would strongly recomend it to everyone.",1
"pre-orderd on ps3, 3 years later gets gaming pc, plays on ultra.... whole new game.",1
"excellent game, great characters, lots of fun highly recommend",2
"seriously ? you are looking for reviews about skyrim ?! just buy the game already !!",1
"this is a great game to have firstly it has insanely epic graphics secondly there is lots of citys and dungeons to explore in the world of tamriel and thirdly its extremely hilarious so i highly recommend this game.",1
"love this game. cant think of anything i dont like, honestly. but, a co-op mode would definitely add to it. nothing like killing dragons with friends.",2
"this game is too much fun, i love this game. 11/10",1
"and theeeeeere it is friends. the ugly truth. we are the children of man. talos is the true god of man.",1
"theres a glitch on the pc,where skyrim autoquits sometimes when you play itam dealing with the bug,goin to contact steam officals about it if this doesnt work.",1
"i love this game so much, if they came up with another, not online i would play for the rest of my life",1
"the best rpg ive ever played, definitely worth the 60$ i paid. my favorite game. 10/10",2
"this game right here is definatly amazing at first i was a little put off from it because all the bad reviews id got from friends that got me into the series when one handed me oblivan but ive got to say its got a great story line and the gameplay keeps me coming back for me i would definatly recommend this to anyone who has or hasnt tried the elder scrolls series",1
"the best game from bethesday by far. skyrim mixes amazing graphics, a large sandbox world, tons of quests, a great storyline, and is just overall an awesome experience. skyrim pushes the limit for future games to live up to.",2
"10/10 i must say out of all of the games in the elder scrolls series (ive played them all) this is the only game with a straight forward plotline but it does not tell you what to do in a way like it is as simple as breathing and the graphics have improved but i did kind of like the graphics from oblivion but meh im a graphics freak but anyways back to the topic this game has indepth story telling (it has more than any other game in the elder scrolls series not including online because that is not done so i will not judge it yet) and you get to pla as the mythical golden hero of skyrim who holds ancient meaning in the shaping of the history of the majority of every game in the series, anyone who plays this can see the world reamagined like never before with an extreme amount of suprises rages and laughs (rarely) but mainly the famous i took an arrow to the knee (for the love of god please remove that ;~;) anyways great arching storyline great job guys keep up the good work!",1
"the vanilla game is okay, but not exactly my cup of tea... i dont prefer hack-n-slash types of games. but when you add in some of the available mods the game can do all sorts of things. i really like the exploration.",1
"click here to write a comment to all your friends i dont have any friends!!!",1
"you can embark on epic (mental-attempted) quests like see how high you can reach into the sky when a giant smashes you up there.",1
"this game is just too awesome to describe... there is too much content to even make a review all you need to know is that its a must for all gamers especially pc players",2
"cool game and since i even made a few mods for it, have to recommend. :)",1
"if you really need a recommendation for skyrim, i have 4 words: buy it, play it . i recently played thru it again with the skyre mod and a few other graphical and minor mods. skyre changed the experience completely and if you loved skyrim, but have played it until your face went numb like the rest of us, this mod offers a fresh spin on how things are done. its also more difficult and rewarding.",1
"there is no reviews necessary for this game, if youre considering it, just buy it. mods are also better on nexus just for reference, google it.",1
"i really like these types of games because no matter how many times you play it there is something new to discover. it is fun to work your way through the characters and discover their hidden talents and how to enhance them by selecting particular traits to improve. the dlcs are good to add to the gaming experience.",2
"the elder scrolls v has such a beautiful world that rewards you for exploring, with lots of interesting quests and loot to be had. the combat doesnt have much depth, but is still fun. (especially if youre a mage!!) environments can be beautiful, but textures, shading, and mesh quality are all lacking. it also lacks the complexity of the older elder scrolls games, a trend of the past few in the series, but it is still an amazing experience. but dont forget the mods! mods can make the game so much better, both mechanically and graphically. even without mods, though, it is an incredible game that will suck up tons of your time.",1
"there are two things i regret about buying this game. 1. not having bought the legendary edition. 2. not having bought the game before. the game has an outstanding work put into it, story, details, gameplay, experience.... one of the best games ive ever played, and it will be very difficult to match. highly recommended.",1
"100+ hours on console, another 1000 intended on pc.",1
"this game is rather amazing. best with dlc. as a scalie it saddens me to kill the drags but its got to be done :c (except alduin, hes a )",1
"this is the best game i have ever played, it is so realistic and pretty. wayyyyy better then any other elder scrolls game.",1
"skyrim is just such an awsome epic game. to bad it is so good, it does not leave much time for the other elder scrolls games.",2
"lol i think we all know this game. this game can lead you to mountains and endless amounts of exploring. including the workshop, their is endless amounts of things everyday you can explore. you will not regret getting this game, having the fact that you have so many paths and can choose from to being an archer, mage and a melee with certin weapons.",1
"this game is great value for money - especially with the three added dlcs of dragonborn, dawnguard and hearthfire. it can be a bit annoying to arrive back in whiterun and be instantly hacked to pieces by vampires, however, they do have some great kit that you can nick off them once youve given them the good news. being able to choose between following the set storylines or just wandering around the world aimlessly gives many variables to ones gaming experience, and of course the plethora of mods just adds nice customised play. having the mods easily accessible via the steam workshop is highly convenient. awesome game, awesome experience - play it now!",1
"legit weeb trash -mog dankush to start this off, i believe i am required to state that if you are in the market for a complete and utter trash tier piece of over hyped , a piece of legit weeb trash, then look no further, as bethesda has made a new and completly ing awfull entry to this time honred and, deservedly, hated genre of trash. if you, like most sane people, do not wish to waste and toil away your time on complete trash, i highly suggest that you steer clear of this game, or for that matter, any game (yes, even fallout) in bethesdas library of complet . heed my words, this game is trash, do not play, avoid at all costs.",1
"im going to attempt to say everything you can do in skyrim. if you have not played skyrim yet, sit back and read. okay, in the elder scrolls v: skyrim... you can: -kill dragons -get paid by nobles to kill bandits. -scream words of power. -travel to the top of the highest mountain. -defeat the king of dragons. -summon a dragon to fight for you. -go fishing. -eat cabbages. -go farming. -get a house (of many choices). -decorate the house. -get married. -have a wedding. -adopt children. -listen to annoying guards. -decimate small rabbits. -use swords. -greatswords. -use battleaxes. -regular axes. -frickin magic. -a -load of other weapons. -become a thane. -get arrested for stealing a plate. -get marauded for killing a chicken in town. -become a vampire. -become a werewolf. -ride a horse. -become an assassin. -kill the emperor. -become a thief. -live in the sewers. -get drunk. -kill witches. -alchemy. -join the war. *loud gasp for air* now keep in mind, this is about 3/4 of whats in the normal game. there are also dlcs, mods, tuns of stuff! 10/10. buy this game now!",1
"if this game was a potato....it would be a good potato potato/potato would potato again",1
"highly recommend. harder the higher you go on settings. tons of stuff to kill, random events, and things to do [not all violent and some even mind teasers]. love the game it is in my top 10 games to play.",1
"great game massive amount of quests and many paths to choose only drawback is no multiplayer",1
"words cannot express the true intention of how this game really makes my life of gaming truly worth living. i have played my share of this game, and im not done just yet. the combat is realistic, more realistic than oblivion. i love how much the graphics have improved from the previous games in the series, less cartoony and more realistic, but thats not what makes this game great. what does make this game a great game is that the gameplay overall, the combat, smithing, alchemy, enchanting, quests, and exploring are truly something to glue you to your computer chair for several hours. however, as with issues with most games, are the bugs. this game is glitchy as f**k, but as you play for extended periods of time, youll get used to it. many character voices are used over and over again, meaning that most of the characters sound the same as other characters, but that doesnt really matter, buy this game!",3
"by far on of the best games i ever played. no possible description could do it any amount of justice. 11/10, banana/burgah.6",2
"i bought this after beating the main questline the game seems to never end. its amazing at the amount of locations you can visit. with mods this game can truly go on forever. it is by far the best game ive had ever played. highly recommend it!",1
"this game is amazing. ive been playing it since it came out.",1
"wonderful game if you want an open world with quite a bit to do. the expansions add more to the wonderful lore that is elder scrolls. a great game, but fairly glitchy, even with mods. recomend going to nexus to find mods that interest you.",1
"amazing game, graphics are outstanding with a very entertaining storyline.",1
"the game is lifeless and gets so much praise for quantity over quality simply because it came from an established and popular company. 0/10 would [never] play again. like skyrim but with skyrim -ign",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",1
"great and amazing game even after 3+ years. i recommend modding the absolute  out of it until your computer crashes. god i love this game.",1
"the good thing about skyrim is you cant beat it in a day. the game is very time consuming and very fun, the story line keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the wonderful graphics make me realize how great this game truley is. skyrim is worth it, and so is the dlc. if your looking for a game where you can free-roam, complete quests, and overall have a great time, then this is the game for you. +graphics +story line +quests +time consuming +free-roam rating: 9/10",1
"best rpg game to date. all elderscrolls are worth buying!",1

"amazing game! i had it for xbox until mine died, recently saw it for sale and couldnt resist. a must have game. theres also a big modding community for skyrim, i recommend the unoffical patches they helped smooth out my gameplay a good bit.",1
"i simply love this game. i bought it about two years back on my birthday for my xbox for 10 dollars at gamestop. this was the first rpg type game i ever played and enjoyed it immensly. but, just a few monthes ago i started to switch over to the p.c. to give it a chance. the first gamei bought was this and when i found out about console commands (just use them for fun) i figured out this game has it all. great story, combat, and the graphics are absotuley stunning. and the fact that i could get mods to addon to the already massive world i just got happy. overall i reccomend this to anyone that loves a strong rpg and loves tes series.",1

"by far my most recommended game. if you are into medieval ages then this is the perfect game for you. i recommend all of its dlcs as the stories are epic. the only downside is lydia. however you can find so many mods to make the game perfect for you. the money loss is most definitely worthwhile and you can always come back and play it and still enjoy it as much as you did when you first started. the game gives you so much freedom and you dont need a really good computer to play, all you need is a well working computer, yet the graphics are still good.",2
"skyrim is a very detailed and exciting game to play. the soundtracks are just amazing and the artwork is beautiful. i love how dragons just sometimes unexpectedly appear out of nowhere especially when youre not prepared to fight one. some of the quests are really cool. i definitely give this game a yes and its a recommended one for me.",1
"all i can say is. look maw! i have my own awesome world to rule, destroy and just down right play anyway i want to in. if you dont already own this game, you must be in a coma and need to wake up. lol. god game all the way. :)",2
"as you all know an awesomly fun and adentourous game that should be played by generations upon generations",1
"the only game out there where killing chickens gets you bounties. highly reccomend.",1
"wow. this is the first game that i can never get tired of, even years after the release. it is plain as day, one of the best games of all time to me, because of its sheer potential with modding and the overall game itself. everyone should have this game.",1
"this is a great game with lots of story and possibility. i would recomend it to anyone who likes rpgs",1
"amazing. i actually bought the legendary edition after i played the pirated version for 400+ hours and i logged 18 hours of the bought version on steam. even without any mods the game offers hundreds of hours of entertainment with a world chock full of things to do and places to explore. the mods add so much more content that there is literally o end to things you can do. mods like falskaar and maids ii add hundreds of hours of extra and enbs and texture packs overhaul the game to have graphics on par with 2013 and 14 games like crysis 3 and battlefield 4.",1
"the elder scrolls series never ceases to amaze me. these games really put you in the action and let you do things you can only do in dreams. i personally have always loved the thought of living in the middle ages- fighting a dragon or 2, slaying some vampires, being able to carry awesome weapons- and skyrim is the best way i have found to do this. i would definitely recommend this game to any of my friends!",1
"what can i say nothing really ..... this game was gifted to me by a good chum the end",1
"freedom to do what you want, pick a spot on the horizon and just go there. controls are great to use, great scenery and some nice battles, lots of places to explore and things to find in dungeons, caves, towns, farms, etc. you can also create magic potions, make armour, weapons, increase your skills with skill books, traps to avoid and lots of quests to do too.",4
"the elder scrolls is my favorite video game series. i played 150 hours of skyrim on the xbox 360, and over 300 hours on steam. there is nearly endless content and the modding community has really added to the longevity of this game. skyrim is one of the best action rpgs to date.",2
"i killed lydia by pushing her off the mountain; she became a burden. 11/10",1
"whats not to like about skyrim? its all over the net, in a couple hundred memes, and is just a beautiful/fun/well developed game. its still a bit expensive to buy, but worth every penny. definitely going to buy the mmorpg when they finally release it. :)",1
"tons of things to do - ive since forgone doing the main quest lines and now have about 50 side quests lined up in my quest menu. ive gone dungeon diving, slayed dragons, destroyed entire bandit camps, and ive only passed through about half of the map so far (at 18 hours). im looking forward to many more hours with the time sink.",1
"i dont know why people wear horned helmets. they look like angry cows.",1
"i love all the elder scrolls games, they are my favorite! i love that its so versatile. you can be whoever you want and do whatever you want. i like the main storyline as well as the stories behind the side quests. great visuals and an amazing atmosphere. i would definitely recommend this game!",1
"i actually have no idea what ive done i killed an entire village after playing 1 hour oh my god seroiusly",1
"hours and hours of vikingy fun, from helping some poor bugger out by doing a quest or ing up some villagers day by going apache on their asses this game has it all, ever wanted to hit a mud crab with a ? well now you can! the workshop has a vast amount of mods that make my crotch tingle at the thought of what i can aspire to do. the possibilities are endless you son of a ! now download this game!!!!",1
"although it reeks of the fallout new vegas game still the best elder scrolls yet, i prefer to it eso! love the story and it fits in with df mw and oblv well.",1
"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played. it combindes amazing graphics, an original storyline, and unique player custimation to add depth and dynamic to the game. although in comparrison to oblivion many quests are simply lacking in length and content (companions) and therfore the conection your get to different guilds and your character. however, the game is still amazing and should be played by everyone.",1
"my favourite single player rpg ever! a detailed, lore-rich world with countless dungeons, quests and characters, ive had one of the best fantasy experiences ever! the combat is kind of easy and repetitive (mashing left and right click), but i set myself challenges like dont take any damage so it is more intereted. there is also a fantastic modding community which is so easy to get involved in. id thoroughly recomend it to anyone into rpgs. 9/10",1
"i never thought i would end up putting in over 380 hours of play (and counting) into this game --and this is just on the pc version. ive got another 700+ hours on the console version and i have no intentions of stopping anytime soon. obviously i reeeaaaallly like this game. excellent graphics (even in the vanilla version) and tons of quests will keep you wrapped up in this game for months.",2
"this game is pretty sick, and ive also put 90 well spent hours of my life into this game. its a game that you keep on wanting more, and more will come! 10/10",1
"this is a really interesting game, i like open world action rpg game. i really do recommend this game, which is really interesting and fun to play with. there is lots of variation in mods to play that made by other player and make the game more and more interesting. try it!",1
"amazing game, even if i get lost in the map quite often, way too big :)",1
"first of all, i cannot even begin to explain the satisfaction you get from shouting some bandit of a mountain. trust me, its that good! skyrim is a world you can easily lose yourself in, highly detailed, exploration will consume hour upon hour of your time without you even knowing. and dudes... dragons. i mean come on! i barely even scratched the surface yet im loving each and every single aspect of it. i know this was a buggy game back in 2011 but that time is long gone, almost all of its problems have been adressed and it plays like a charm even on low end pcs. the world itself is worth the price of admission. and with a little modding (did i mentions its modding capabilitys are fully supported?) you can make it look even better. i got its legendary edition 66% off and let me tell you it was probably my best purchase to date and the price was an absolute steal. my advice to you? has i write this, christmas is around the corner and you dont even have to save much.",1
"i love this game, preferably on pc than ps3, i own both on both consoles and find that the pc graphics are so much better. a great game, great exploration oppertunities. a personal favourite if you like game where you can have a storyline and create your own destiny then this is for you enjoy creating new charcters and giving them different skill sets mix and match heavy and lightweight skills experiment with charcters and find what works best for you a truly enjoyable game for all",1
"best game ever!! seriously i love this game first one i ever playd twice. p.s. way better on pc then ps3.",1
"its an elder scrolls game, why the hell would you not play it? there bloody amazing.",2
"i absouletly love this game, it has so much content. the workshop that is linked to this proviedes so much simplicity but some of the mods can screw up the game with errors and crashes, but that is rare and its not the games fault is it though.",1
"great game! i do reccomend . if you really enjoyed this i highly reccomend fallout 3",1
"one of the best wrpgs ever made, and surprisingly well optimized for pc if you meet the reqs.",1
"if you own it on console, repurchase it on steam, the mods available add so much to it and makes a great game better, you wont regret it, i didnt.",1
"what i love most about this game is the pure openness. to be able to actually escape into a world where im not required to act on any specific quest line, im not requried to choose a side or be forced into a black and white, good versus evil mentality. the freedom of this game, letting me be anything from lawful good to chaotic evil, warrior and mage, just whatever i feel like being. that is what i find amazing.",1
"best game ever i just wish it wasnt so hard 2 move my head it has set me back & made me die alot",1
"ah, adventure. theres a reason this game got game of the year. it rightly deserves its place on that list and definitely deserves a place on your pc!",1
"ever wanted a game where whatever you do changes the course of the story for you. so every time it is different for every player! i totally recommend this!",1
"as my better half likes to say, i just lost my woman to skyrim. enough said.",1
"lets just say that if i were trapped on a desert island that somehow got electricity and wifi and could only have one video game to play for my entire life i would choose this one. because it is not humanly possible to do all that there is to do in this game in one life time and you will probably never get tired of it. just when you think youre done, youll get sucked back in somehow. it never ends. ever.",1
"it was my first game on pc i love it so much i have 356 hours in to my game and im only 11",2
"skyrim is a fun open world game with great game mechanics, but it lacks a little bit of variety with there being a limited amount of weapons and characters",1
"its an elder scrolls game, do you really even need to think about buying this game? just buy the game, i got this game for 360 on its release, back then my laptop could not handle it, now it can, so a veryyyyy late review, but still, must buy, and if you are new to elder scrolls, then just buy morrowind and oblivion aswell, just because you wont regret it at all!, enjoy!",1
"i mean seriously.....do you not own this game yet? really? for real? i mean.....come on. youre kidding. best game of the year. you dont have it? were you dropped as a child? often? by both parents? buy it already! game of the year!",1
"i played this game for a good 75+ hours before i figured out how to fast travel. i walked from quest to quest. 11/10",1
"this game is suitable for 13+. there is no sexual content unless you download 18+mods other then that theres just marriage and child adoption. it is quite violent but is suitable for a 13 mature. not much alchole. other then that its a awesome game. i have spent 52hours on record in the past 2 weeks. the thing that sucks is that you have to pay for dlc. i just wait till there is a sale then buy it. i have to give this game a 8.5/10.",1
"the best game ever. so much things to do and really nice environment and graphics.",2
"great open world rpg-styled gameplay. yes, it has its various bugs, as does any bethesda title. however, with all the available third-party gamefixes and mods, you can have a thoroughly enjoyable, visually stunning (especially utilizing enb presets) and mostly stable gaming experience to enjoy for hours....or years, if youre anything like me.",1
"its awsome on its own but whit steam workshop you can really spice up your game.totaly worth the money",1
"no guns. 1 out of 5 although it does have a swimming function, so ill give it a 2 out of 5",1
"skyrim. brilliant, nothing more needs be said or spoken.",1
"one of the best games in the world. skyrim, with its huge modding community will bring you almost anything from a magical, medieval world. my gaming hours says it all, you will spend much time in skyrim. keep in mind that mods have made me play this game for so long (5 playthroughs) but modding the game comes at a price. you will have to read yourself into the modding world, often learning the hard way the mistakes you have done by corrupting your save. therefore remember to only install quality mods that have been reviewed by others. tips: never remove a mod. it may be hard, but mods get baked into your savegame, eventually crashing it. this applies to script-based mods. textures are fine. have fun!",4
"some serious replay value here. one of the best games of recent years/memory.",2
"great game i own it on consol but it is 10x better on pc much better graphics with my computer and you can mod the game! its also on sale atm in the steam store. if anyone hasnt bought this game yet for pc i suggest you do.",1
"the vast world of skyrim is massive, and you will have countless hours of fun playing this, there are too many quests to count. play it anyway you like, however you like - in skyrim, you get to choose what happens.",2
"so i played the sh*t out of this game on my ps3, then i heard of a mod to allow me to be a king, i immediatly picked this game up. i have now killed people unkillable, enslaved kids to work in a gold mine and had people fight to the death for my pleasure. now about the normal game, this game as i said gets the sh*t played out of it. i love this game i cant find a moment i have said i hate this game. over 9,000/10",1
"i liked it. you swing swords, you sling spells, you fire arrows, you yell... shouts? i dunno, it was a pretty good generic fantasy type sandbox thing, couldnt really hold my attention. i liked the water, and the waterfalls, and the world, and the villages, and some other things. i thought that claw quest was pretty neat. you know the one. 5/10",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",1
"best game ive ever played. completed the main quests and both expansions in roughly 140 hrs. of game play without getting bored. id even love playing it again but with a different type of character. i will find time to do it one day haha",1
"i didnt mod anything but my character - source = no one i dont really like this.",1
"amazing graphics and sounds. i usually dont like the magic and monsters type of games but i love this game.",1
"plenty of flaws, most of which can be fixed by installing mods from the workshop. quite fun if you play it right.",2
"i played skyrim so much on the xbox. it gets boring after a while, so my brother sold it. now that i have it on pc i have tons of fun with the mods, and the dlc i never bothered to play. its a good time.",1
"excellent game, ive played oblivion and a bit of morrowind when i was yonger and the spirit of the elder scrolls is still intact, really good job by the developers.",1
"awesome game that you could play for hoursa on end.",2
"this is one of the best ways to spend 100 hours of your life. 10/10.",1
"not much more that can be about this game that others have not said. epic. that is all...",1
"skyrim carries on from the legacy of morrowing and oblivion, presenting the player with a dynamic, open world that will entirely consume you. the overall tone of the game is more serious than its predecessor, but still retains good portions of humour and a hugely enjoyable and immersive storyline. dungeons have been revamped brilliantly (no more same-y instances like in oblivion), and the new game engine handles character interaction much more subtly. if you can afford it, skyrim will not disappoint!",2
"best mmo ever played, good job bethesda. please make more of these games they are amazing.",2
"this game provides so much fun, even if suffering from lacking story elements",1
"some pros and cons but the overall product is nice, a very addicting game with mods.",5
"i killed a few bandits 10/10 would play again. but seriously, if you havent yet, buy this game.",1
"highly customizabe and fun. almost never gets old because adventures are to be had everyday!",1
"this is a very realistic looking game with lots of mods, its even better with mods. not even kidding.. but the vanilla verison is fine to play. very nice graphics, sounds, etc. gameplay is amazing, best is the main quest. for all those haters go and play it some more and see how good this game this.",4
"simply put, one of the most amazing action/adventure rpg experiences out there, with a huge community behind it that constantly creates new content and expands the lore of tes.",1
"made friends with a dragon so i can talk like them.",1
"this game has controled countless hours of my life, on steam it may say i dont have many, but on the xbox i have over 10,000 played and i just cant stop playing this game. skyrim is a very well made and addicting game that makes the player think about if he wants to check that room, or if he wants to eat that tomato 0_0 many people play this game for fun but its part of my life and i really like enjoy it. so many places to go and things to do which makes countless hours of fun..15/10 one of the best!!",1
"skyrim: the game that never ends, and never gets old. that is if you install mods. with mods, this game is one of the best ive ever played, without mods, still one of the best. gg bethsoft. if only there was a co-op elder scroll/fallout game other than the shitpile eso.",3
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",1
"if you have this game on a console and you like it. its 100 times better on pc. buy it. 10/10",1
"hunt dragons in the land of the vikings. shout your enemies into submission. ride your horse up a mountain.",1
"ive been playing tes games since morrowind (and even went back and played some daggerfall when it became free). while i dont get some of the design decisions this is still an amazing game! no, i dont like the fact that you no longer have attributes, which makes race selected nearly a cosmetic choice, but that hasnt detracted from me playing the game.",1
"quite frankly the best rpg ive played. easier modable and great to play.",1
"its skyrim, an elder scrolls game with modern visuals great modding tools and a ton of content, there is no way to go wrong with the game. you can have fun here whether youre an action fan, or if role playing is more your style this game was made for you! it is all the elder scrolls goodness wrapped up into one neat modern package and it would be a shame if you didnt at least try it! also getting to play the game again after running through it on xbox was just a treat so even if you think youve already seen all there is to see, you havent.",1
"this is an rpg if you like playing medieval games that involes a lot of fantasy this is for you",1
"im pretty sure the land of skyrim has a draugr problem, rather than a dragon one. enjoyable, but pretty boring after a while, 8/10",1
"the best option for an open world fantasy game you can get on steam. fantastically executed and true to the world of the elder scrolls. ive spent many hours just wandering skyrim. what you get out of this game comes from what you put into it. i found it a lot more satisfying to give my characters their own backstories in order to justify what i was doing. dont let the sometimes amusing glitches get in your way and you can see why this game was so talked aobut at its release. also, why dont you own it yet?",2
"amazing... i know this game was released a fwe years ago but i dont think its too late. the ai (guards villagers etc.) are extremely reactive and tough. combat is just stunnuing and the realistic graphocs... oh dem graphics. i would reccomend you buying this game if you are into fantasy games but it there is one downside: the large map!!! the map is huge it takes hours to cross it and some of the quests require it. buy this game!!!!!!",1
"i started with oblivion and never really liked it much, until i managed to get add ons for the game. it was a take back by the amount of time, that they had put into this epic game. but when it comes down to skyrim...it is just awesome!",1
"a great fun game with lots of content. its awesome.",1
"i used the kill console command to kill general tullis at helgen gr8 job m8 i r8 8/8",1
"this game is a unbelieveable adventure, even if you havent played the older elders scrolls games it doesnt matter. there are some inside jokes, that you might not understand unless you have played the older ones (maiq im looking at you). with the addition of steam workshop you can mod this game very easily to increase the graphical fidelity, or add more quests, although the main quest, is already excellent and the sidequest are great. the graphics on their own are good, but not great. but remember were looking at a 2 year old game so the graphics, arent at 2013 level. with the addition of dawnguard and dragonborn you can add two whole new questlines which both you can affect like the main games quests. pros: quests are great. even after completing the main quest line, you will have a lot of interesting side quests. the attention to detail is amazing. the world levels with you, after you break a certain level you will see new enemies. cons: voice acting isnt the strongest part of this game; the same voice actors are recycled from character to character. the graphics arent the best, but remember, were looking at a 2011 years game.",3
"this is the game of the year 2011. buy this game! its worth your money.",2
"bought this game years after its release yet this is already a classic that will survive time, with a neverending set of mods to improve quality at this pace this game may have decent modern graphics for a the next decade. for the price steam sales have been making this huge game is a steal. this game will keep you hooked for days, weeks, months exploring the gorgeous landscapes of the huge world full of little secrets here and there. the only negative point is that you may not have time for your own life, seriously play it during some holidays or something because this game may absorb you.",1
"this game has alot of content in it. ive never liked rpg, but this one geez its epic!",1
"this game gives you a new look in life... well, what im sayin is, you wont wanna join reality ever again! skyrim is the best game i have ever bought and i highly recomend this game to people who need a... change of scenery (i guess you could call it that). you can chose between humane, elven and beast races, a fair amount of hairstyles and colours, ranges of eye colours, armour, clothing, personalitys and likings. you can use this game for so many things, such as, roleplay, adventure, just to muck about on, testing mods, getting quests done, and... alot more! once again, i highly suggest this game, for it may change youre perspective on reality. (not in a bad way)",1
"this game is so awesome i wanna play it every day so yea i love the part when i get to kill pplz",1
"awesome! singeplayer with alot of do! if you finish the main story there is still some side quests what you can do. you can think are you archer, magic man, swordman, axeman... or little bit all of em! but if you dont like medieval, want some shooter this game isnt for you. too boring? not so much stuff? test mods, that is good for you. bad thing about mods: it makes your game alot easier. have fun if you buy this!",1
"the game is fun until youve beaten countless time on the console version. but on the pc you can get a wide range of extra goodies from the workshop, which brings the excitement and thrill back to the game.",1
"tl;dr: its good. buy it. i am 50~ hours of gameplay in. i want them to release a dlc so i can give them more of my money. i like skyrim out-of-the-box two or three times more than i liked oblivion. there are definite ui problems, but the core gameplay is there. the leveling system is not awful. combat can get repetetive, but you are not locked into a choice of magic/ranged/melee. being able to enchant/smith along with alchemacizatize is nice, and is pleasantly simple enough, yet diverse enough to feel like youre accomplishing something but not spending too much time doing it. skyrim has two main things going for it: scope and fantastic production quality. the bad: its an obvious console port. this can be mitigated somewhat. the entire thing has a slightly grittier, real feeling going for it than oblivion, one that works very, very well. cant wait for modders to get their hands on the toolsets to change/fix what the developers didnt have time to.",2
"ive spent much time in this game. even though there are bugs, and some may get annoyed by quests that simply say bring this and that to me and ill give you this and tha , i really enjoy every second ive had playing it. i can easilly recommand it even to people that didnt play many rpgs, or none in their lives.",2
"in theory, this should be a good game. its a huge world, with lots of variety so you dont get bogged down with a long line of very similar quests (as is often the case in rpgs). the graphics are gorgeous! buuuuuut, the pc version is full of bugs! it crashes constantly! the internet is full of people complaining about skyrim crashing on pc, and everyone has a different situation, making it almost impossible to solve. sadly, im so frustrated with this game that i cant see myself putting in too many more hours.",1
"this is one of my favorite games of all times. the fact that it is open world is amazing, and the character developement is so much fun! i love the voice acting, and the quests. it keeps you busy for sooooo long! and the best part honestly is all of the silly bugs! skyrim has the best glitches ever. xd",2
"im not sure if any one reads this but if they do i want them to known that they did an amazing game the graphics are awesome and the interaction is so much ive necer seen anything like it. its amazing i love steam also i would like some help, i bought 7 days to die a few months ago and it doesent work... i was a bit sad and angry cause i spent thirty euros on the game and it would not work. whaiting for an anser.",1
"oh skyrim... as the only elder scrolls game ive ever played i wont be able to compare it to previous game in the series, but ive got to say that i have really enjoyed my time with this game. youve got plenty of things to do for at least 100+ hours of gameplay, but eventually you will run out of things to do, or grow tired of some quests, which are almost the same. then theres some very well made dlcs to give you even more to play around with (i would definately recommend buying both the base game and all the dlc) and that probably gives you about 50+ hours extra. once youve exhausted all the things that is given to you by the base game and the dlcs you can delve into a huge world of mods for the game! seriously, once you start using mods for skyrim, you wont go back, its incredible how many mods there are, and they will provide even more time in the northern part of tamriel. i would definately recommend the game! :d",1
"50 hours of joy on this beautiful game so far. many more to follow!",1
"endless hours of content, massive world, good replay ablity and nice combat. simply put one of the best open world rpgs.",1
"it is one of the best purchases i made. it will keep you entertained especially with mods it will be an amazing game 10/10 and dont forget 4.4.14 elder scrolls online",1
"one of my favourite games of all time. get some mods installed and you have 100s and 100s of hours of entertainment to enjoy!",1
"arguably the last game you ever need to buy...who am i kidding? its not the last game youll ever buy. but its huge. the scale is epic. im 50 hours in, and not even midway done the main plot. its absorbing, entertaining, and honestly massive.",1
"this is my favourite game to give a bad review of.",1
"ridiculously addictive. on a slightly more elaborative note: this game is really what you make it. the combat, especially the magic, can feel somewhat lacking; the dungeons are all pretty similar and there isnt really too much variety between enemies (bandits and draugr and more bandits and more draugr and an occasional dragon); your actions in the game can feel pointless as things rarely change meaningfully; and there are just so many things that annoy you, from how guards all telephatically alert eachother to how you can just never master pickpocketing. still, it hits all the right spots if you let it. the bow-sniping executes, the many small sub-plots, sidequests and minor characters that flesh out an entire virtual world, the voice acting, more arrows to knees than you really care to count (yet still less than youd expect, given the fascination with the phrase online). read up on some lore (either out of the game or ingame - the books are often helpful, insightful or flat out amusing), create a character and just play the game, if you just want a quick fix skyrim is really not for you (it works, it just doesnt work well for its price), its very much a game that gets better and better the more time and involvement you commit. and then theres the mods. ridiculously addictive.",2
"amazing game and no fixed storyline so you change what may happen",1
"already a classic, although it doesnt give the same scope to personal decisions made by your character the way other games do. still, it offers massive content, varied locations, impressive music, convincing ambient sounds and random conversations between non-player characters. and some occasional funny stuff as well. ;)",1
"there really is no other game that can be compared to this experience. the closest i can think of would be soloing a mmo. great game. the mods make it even better.",2
"just like oblivion and morrowind, extremely immersive solo rpg that defines what a sandbox game. a must have.",1
"this is the best game i have ever played. i got all the dlcs. finished everything and still play it. love this game just love it.",2
"i saw a mudcrab by the water, recently i steer clear of them. they have sharp pincers i avoid them when i can their meat isnt bad.",1
"steam workshop makes it a millon times better, console commands make it possible to work around game breaking bugs, and its just better overall",1
"brothers and sisters are like natural enemies, like imperials and nords or bretons and nords or argonians and nords or nords and other nords! damn nords! they ruined skyrim!",4

(sorry i yelled at you, come on back). everything about this game is so fun to play, youll be spending hours on your butt playing in a fantasy world, that is so breathtakingly awesome, that your going to be spewing awesome sauce all over your monitor. now you could either stay here and moan about not having enough money, or spend your money on a game that is like baby sitting for an adult, thats right because as soon as you start playing your going to stop fighting with your brothers and sisters, and your going to start slaying some bloody dragons. just go buy this game, 19.99 you can afford that now, come on now. buy the elder scrolls v: skyrim today, or as soon as you get that money of course. millions love it (it shows), i love it (obviously), youll love it (no doubt).",1

"must play this epic game i want it to have online tho :c",1
"the game is beautiful, very well designed scenario, and have good soundtrack, a vast lore and a somewhat interesting storyline...that being said, the npcs are all the same, they do not evolve and respond to your character differently in a significant way as you progress in the game (yes, the guards will eventually whisper about you being the dragonborn, but if you speak to then they will just act as you are a normal citizen), the looting system sucks, you need to spend a lot of time in town to sell all the loot you collect in dungeons (normally the vendors just dont have enough money, so youll just need to not sell everything or travel to another town to sell it). the combats are pretty much the same, with very little change. bosses sometimes require some strategy, but mostly theyre just tought guys that need more hits. the game can get me bored in about 30 min. if you find this game on sale, i would recommend the purchase. but i wouldnt spend a lot of money in it.",1

"really fun game. the only thing that made me quit for a couple of months now was a gamebreaking bug (i accepted the jagged crown quest, but never gave the crown to ulfric. so then, at the time of the peace treaty meeting at hrothgar, noone took their seats when i sat down in my assigned seat. so the game pretty much didnt work beyond that point, so i gave up after that). but i am going to make a new character relatively soon and probably not a dual wield warrior anymore :d.",1
"this is one of the best games ever and to this day it still stands pretty high on the need to play list. this is one of the best games i have ever played. the controls run smoothly ( on the x-box controller) and the dialouge is interesting not everyone sounds robotic and boring. you can make a lot of choices on who you see next who you talk to and wether or not to do this or that. mods are really fun for this game too it never really gets boring because of mods there is just so much to see and so much to do! so stop reading this comment and go get the freakin game already its great!!",1

"===edited as of january 2nd, 2015=== its not as good as morrowind or oblivion if we start talking about storytelling and immersion, but skyrim is a hell of a game, and it won game of the year back in 2011 for an obvious reason: its great, and i know it really is, when after 230 hours of game i still dicovering new places and things about it. even now in 2015, if you ask me if you should buy it, i would say yes without thinking twice, its a must-play along with the rest of the elder scrolls series, and just like any other bethesda game, when you start heavilly modding it, itll become another game, and then another game, and then another game again, and in the end itll be like you have bought a pack with at least 5 games, and not just one.",1
"if you havent played this game before you should probably stop what your doing right now, buy this game and prepare yourself for the fun you are about to have. your not just buying a game here, you are buying a virtual world to wonder around and adventure in. play it for a few hundred hours and then go check out the mods, where you can expand the game with new towns, lands, quests and be able to make it much, much more visually impressive. seriously, if you dont own this yet you are missing out.",1

"skyrim is very good at wrapping you into the game, and making you play for hours on end. it has amazing graphics, if your computer can take it and you brain can comprehend it. it does have some problems though, even with dlc, the story is short. i must not forget some loading times can ruin your experience, same with glitches. but hey, it is a big world for the game to load. and any story problems can be fixxed, with or without mods.",1
"this is an amazing game thateveryone should play it.",2
"this game has become one of my favorites simply becuase of the almost boundless roaming freely, the dlcs (i have all), the mods, the gameplay, and graphics. this game allows you to do just about anything you can think of. you can, murder, rob people, buy houses, travel, marry, adopt kids, and even go to college. it has great creatures roaming the lands, bandits, witches, demons, dragons, trolls, vampires, and werewoles. you can even become a vampire or a werewolf....unfortunately theres no hybrids between the two. fortunately, though there are guilds you can join with their own quest. throughout this game you will recieve many titles and do mysterious things....especially if your a vampire or a wolf. also to mention that you can unlock these amazing perks as you level up. those perks will benefit you very much with whatever weapons you choose/use. theres even a such thing as console commands......in other words cheats. all-in-all, this is an excellent game to have, play, and to own.",1

"one of my favorite games of all time. the modding community is great, but the game doesnt even need it. it is a very immersive game, that doesnt restrict you on what to do when to do it. if you dont want to do a quest, you can simple ignore it. you are dovahkiin(dragonborn), you find that out after you fight your first dragon. the story is rather short it makes up for it in the countless hours on shenanigans and lollygagging. your character seems unrealisticly special throughout the game. what i mean by that is you become the top of every class and yet you are still just another adventurer. the game is beautiful, and just worth your time. this game was release 11-11-11 and it still is one of the best games of the decade. the game is a must buy, even if you dont like rpgs genre. i am sure you may come out of your shell and let your inter nerd come out and become all powerful! youre going to try to sell me something. well, i aint interested. olda 10/10",1
"most people are familiar with the elder scrolls or the fallout games by bethesda. open world, first-person rpgs with a large traversable areas and often have their share of bugs and defects. skyrim is the fifth installent in the elder scrolls series, and it delivered to player expectations (in comparison to the hype that has had a profound effect on several titles in the last couple years). skyrim has a good story, maybe not great, but good enough. you are a dragonborn in the scandanvian-esque skyrim province amidst the return of the dragons and a civil war, 200 years after the events of obliviob. the gameplay is smooth, and to some players dismay, more open ended with the dissolusion of the class sytem from the earlier titles. the graphics are great for a 2011 game, and the soundtrack is simply astounding. skyrim is a solid game with everything it has to offer, and the steam workshop support makes it very easy to customize your experience. all in all, its a pretty great game. yes it has its problems and bugs (such as no change in technology over a 200 year period). the game still stands as a powerful experience for the rpg fan. the expansions definitely add extra flavor as well. 8.75/10",1
"this was the best game that came out in 2011. first of all, its the elder freaking scrolls. second, dragons. third, mothain duel spells. a lot of immersion, especially with the plentiful mods the community makes on steam and on the nexus, this game never gets dull. i just wish they didnt make the atmosphere so depressing. 8/10",1

"if this game was a potato, it would be a very good potato.",1
"30% of the game is simple combat-there are a variation of spells- items-spell items-and a basic variation of types of combat, but there are only 4 or 5 buttons during combat-wsad. the are no customizable ability hotkeys!!! pressing q repeatedly to access your favorites tab (where all of your favorite weapons, types of armour, spells, potions, scrolls, types of weapons, ect. are located- is tiring and takes away from immersion. story was okay. graphics were good. immersioon was attempted. modding was okay. ai was very choppy and predictable (all combat was boring and reptitive.) the gainable items could be interesting, but were mmostly just stats. after my first 90 hours i went to modding and that got me by for a while, but no matter how much i wanted to like the game and its medium array of stories, it all just fealt sloppy. worth $5, maybe even $7.",1
"this was a favorite of mine back on xbox 360 looks even more awesome on pc glad to relive all over again at this great summer sale 2014 price. can sit and watch this all day lol",1
"a great game its open world and well i could go on for ages because its a awesome game",1
"my fav game ever! graphics are supreme and gameplay is amazing. i would recommend for those who love rpg and fantasy.",1
"skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played, pc or otherwise. it was great on the xbox, but the pc takes it to a whole new level due to the amount of mods that can be installed. bottom line: get the game.",1
"holy molly! this game is by far one of the best games i have ever played in my entire life... this game is life... this game is love",2
"it has an amazing setting and keeps you hooked for hours! ^^ also, the storyline is very creative and is very appealing.",1
"an amazing game. made by an amazing company. with amazing mods and endless fun. why are you looking at this review anyway? buy! buy! buy!",1
"this game is cool. but! when i get to the party you know? and when i was sneaking in to the kitchen, and then i needed to take items from the box you know. my items arnt in the box!!! its gone!! nothing!! wasted moneeeey!!!!! because of that f*ing bug or what the f*k it was, im going to give this game 4/10 im not the only one, many peoples have the same problem! i want my money back -.-",1

"first time i played this when i preordered in 2011, i was very disapointed, the game was very buggy and some of the stuff the devs said they would put in wasnt there, skyrim wasnt anytihng like i expected and im dissaponited, but i did spend a lot of time on it, because cmon, its an elder scrolls game, but oblivions better. go buy oblivion kids, its more for your money.",1
"the best game for a long time. its a game. you can play it again and again even without commutys mods. if you havent played skyrim yet (omg, is it even possble???) take your money from the wallet and put this game to your game library right now! oh. my. god. 1010, 1010!!!",1
"the vanilla game is just amess, it needs mods to make the game what it should be. for that alone i cant recommend this.",1
"umm, why are your reading this review? buy it now!!! this game is just bliss and the mods just prolong the life of skyrim to infinity. example of this is the mod falskaar which adds an entire island and took me over 10hours to complete. i just come back to this game whenever the game genre is letting me down. you can not regret buying this game unless your a hardcore fps gamer or something. :) go for it but maybe let the dlc go because the mods make up for it.",2
"there are mods that give you amazing boobs! 5/5 stars",2
"this game. this game. where do i start? excellent graphics, excellent story, all of it i enjoyed. though at one point somebody was cutting wood and had wood stuck in them. definetely recommended.",2
"if you didnt like morrowind, oblivion, fallout 3 or fallout new vegas because that whole exploring thing was just too much bother then don;t go anywhere near this. if you want something that manages to take the best from all of those games and furnish them together in a massive, stunning package then yes, this is for you. im 20 hours in and its only been out 2 days. in fact the only true worry i have about this game is that i may end up being more familiar with the world of skyrim than my own city.",1
"honestly, a million times better than the console versions in terms of graphics! plus the console commands make it a fun experience. 11/10.",1
"the best single player rpg ive ever played hands down. you can do pretty much anything in the world of skyrim. very realistic. the story is grand and the fighting and battles are epic. from crafting your own armor to reading the books, every angle has been thought out and no stone unturned to give you the best sandbox experience you could ever have in a single player role playing game. 10 out of 10 for this title. stellar gaming experience.",1
"i personally think skyrim elder scrolls v is one fo the best games ever because you can be any kind of charector you want a ranger, a mage, a knight, a freiken ninja..... also its a really devoloped game and theres manyy mods avalible through steam and other places",1
"youve read the reviews, now ditch those excuses: get this game & experience it for yourself.",1

"the game is great..... when it works..... i cannot reccomend it. the game was fine for about 20 hours, then for some reason now it crashes to desktop constantly with no errors. i spent two days, two days trying every fix/solution that exists on the internet and nothing solves the problem. from what ive seen, tons of people have the same problem at random as well. i have had freeze/crash issues with every single bethesda game i own on both ps3 and pc (fallout 3/new vegas, elder scrolls iv/v) i am sick and tired of dealing with this companies unfinished, buggy as crap games. bethesda can go sit and spin to death on all of its useless games.",1
"do i even need to recommend this game? is there anyone that hasnt played this game yet? if you havent, well then stop reading reviews and play the game!",2
"this game is so addictive and with mods it is amazing",2
"skyrim is everything i expected as the next elder scrolls game. i simply love almost everything about it (the voice acting, the combat system, the shout system, you name it!). that being said, i feel that the magic in skyrim is a little bit lacking. this may just be because i prefer to play as a mage, but i really miss the spell creation aspect from oblivion. in skyrim, there are a set number of spells that you can find and/or buy, and thats it. there is no way to get more spells. vanilla skyrim, in terms of magic, didnt really capture my interest like oblivion did. even the college of winterhold was a poor substitute for the mages guild. skyrim, while having great quests and storylines (i simply love the idea of playing as the dragonborn), simply lacked the magical quality (pun intended) that previous elder scrolls games had. if, unlike me, you dont play as a mage in every game, skyrim is the game for you. the dlcs added a whole bunch of amazing new content, and the modding community for skyrim is unlike no other. overall, i would give skyrim a 9/10 (magic being the only problem).",2
"sooo addicting! the vanilla game is fun by itself but if you ever get bored of it there are tons of mods to get for it. also for some reason it runs better on my pc than minecraft does...lol",1
"i wont lie, at first i thought this was going to be a re-hash of oblivion, after playing new vegas, but fortunately for me, bethesda pulled through! there are way too many things to cover in what i love about this game, from the content available, as well as all of the great things that the steam community has to offer. i have wasted many hours playing with mods, texture packs and quests, and plan to spend even more time doing so. its probably a little late for the review, but if you havent tried this game yet, give steam all of your monies, and hide in your bedroom all weekend.",1
"nords, dragons, magic, axes, throw people off cliffs with shouts, drink beer and eat cheese. this is skyrim.",3
"amazing, immersive game. almost no limit to how much time you could spend playing with so many different character classes and quest types.",1
"im pretty sure my girlfriend plays this more than me, and she loves it, and so do i, a very fun game!",1
"get skyrim, install mods there you go super awesome game",1
"where to even begin with this game, in my opinion it has so much replayability, so many options during a single playthrough, even if youve never touched its prequels you can immerse yourself rather easily in the world of tamriel and skyrim. i heartily recommend this to any who enjoy roleplaying a character and immersion. not to mention youll probably find something you never found before each time you make a new character.",3
"the unmodded is a amazing however when mods are added this game reaches a whole new level. 10/10 would mod again",1
"i own the ps3 version and bought it again on pc. one of the best game ever made.",1
"great game. by itself, a game that you could play for almost ever. but with the modding you cant stop playing. the game is what you would thing it would be for an elder scrolls, but it was a few things that make it stand out. for example, in games like oblivion you define you character right at the start. in skyrim you grow into the all powerful being. and because its not a multiplayer game (thank god) you can be as over powered as you want. it also has a huge map, and if you install the dlc then the area in even larger. but really this gameis about modding. and thats what makes it fun. mod. everything. steam even gives you the choice of downloading the modding tool. the only bad thing i can say is that if you dont have a pretty good pc then you might be a little disappointed that you arent getting the pretty-nes that you want. great game. 9.7/10",1
"forget what you think you know about dragons. you think you saw dragons in wow? you think you saw dragons in mother-ing runescape a? this  right here a, this  right here a? skyrim got next level dragons my a, get rekt 420 yoloswag twerkteam2014 blaze it .",1

"great game, have spent over 100 hours on it, which i rarely do with any game.",1
"10/10 i hated this game soo much till i played it more then 15 mins. how could i be such a neck beard i am ashamed.",1
"better than oblivion, worse than morrowind. still better than 9/10 games.",2
"easily one of the best games out there. even if you already have it on console, get it on pc for the mods. too bad bethesda ed up tes with elder scrolls online... d;",1
"do you like to stab !!!??? course you do. do you like top set  on fire!!!??? course you do. do you like !!!?? course you do. if you olike theese things buy this game now (apart from the last one, if you do go buy fallout)(loll, i still like fallout though)",2
"skyrim is a must if you have any enjoyment in fantasy rpg style games. with a choice of first person or third person views. the crafting is simple to learn and can make more powerful weapons than dropped which makes it worth the effort. the combat is fast and fun. the detail to the game is amazing, i was a little disappointed that some technology was ignored such as directx 11, eyefinity / surround support and 3d was fair. the world is huge, the expansions fun and the community of designers that make add on content huge with some great contributions.",2
"very fun game i definately reccomend buying this even if its not in the sale as you will spend hours on end playing this!!",1
"greatest game ever i walked into a town and killed a chicken then was forced to kill everyone else in the town 9/10 game not enough ogres",1

"this is game is amazing!!! i loved the quality of it and it has an amazing story line with extra sidequests... its never ending i swear...",1
"get this game.. i literally have clocked in 1,000 hours. to good to pass up",5
"a very good game. it is adicting enough to ruin your life. with mods and dcl the game has nearly infinate content. amazing graphics and a good continueation of tes lore. its weak points are a lack of serious roleplaying elements and no character restrictions--you can changeyour birthstone whenever you want, can master magic and all weapons types, limited dialogue, no faction penalties, etc-- which can renove from the replay value. overall a good game, but i also recomend other tes games like morrowind, arena, ore daggerfall",3
"do i suggest this game when its vanilla? no. but get some mods and this game get dozens of times funner.",1
"the elder scrolls universe is the most richest, filled and complete thing. it would take 4 hours to give a minimum explanation and days to give a full explanation. the music is very relaxing and makes you feel like a true nord. <-- had to sneak it in, sorry. every elder scrolls installment has had music to grip you in, and leave you amazed. every flaws this game has, can be forgiven by itself. that is litteraly something you would never see in a game. if you were to inspect every little detail of this game, (probably would take a year) you would be guaranteed to miss some things, so much openworldiness. 10/10 replayability, you can replay this game over and over and over as a different race, each discovering things you will never forget on each character, making you super op. that is why this open-world playground can achieve, and every single npc has a humongous backstory, if you are willing to look into it. a little tiny quest can have so much backstory, leaving you jawdropping on how much lore it has. this game made it to my top 10 games list, at #2, almost beating just cause 2. buy now, or regret doing so because you would miss out on a giant journey, that would make you rethink your life choices. (kind of.)",2
"huge open world rpg, lots of quests to do and many places to explore. some of the quests i find boring, and the game also has an in game feature (especially on console) called a bug. if you go to the wiki and look at the bugs; you will most likely encounter every single one. i felt that the storyline to the game lacked, but its still a good game. if you dont like the story, just dont do it.",1
"skyrim is a game with several flaws (a few dumbed down mechanics, horrible default ui, tons of little bugs, etc) but its just so epic in scale and immersive that you really wont give two  about those little problems. besides, theres mods on nexus and workshop.",1
"this game is absolutly astonishing; the graphic quality is amazing; the storyline is malleable, because you can do the storyline whenever you want, so that you arent 100% required to do the campaigns; and the complete objective of the game is incredible. i strongly only reccomend this game if you have a good computer and if you are able to wait about 6-8 hours for this to download, but ill tell ya, its totally worth it.",1
"awesome game, endless content to play. fun and definitely worth your money",1
"dovahkiin!, kill dragons and giants while drinnking potions, 9/10 game",1

"at first i thought this game would be boring, but after getting farther into the story i came to enjoy it! its a very good game!",1
"pros -dragons -dragons -dragons -dragons -dragons -dragons -dragons -dragons cons -not enough dragons metascore did not rate it 100/100",1
"the thing about skyrim that always brings be back is because it never fails to surprise me. whether it be a dungeon ive never explored or a playstyle ive never tried. skyrim is so addictingly fun and extravagantly beautiful it ceases to amaze me. the modding community makes it all the better allowing you to expand the game to what it always felt like it wanted to be, but bethesda couldnt manage to achieve. skyrim is always going to be my favorite game of all time.",2
"favourite game so far, absolutely love the elder scrolls and bethesda. massively good game, couldnt reccomend it more.",1
"this game is the best rpg ive ever played in my life! i highly reccomend it. but beware some times the loading screens are long.",1
"the best rpg game ever! big open world game and mods are funny,of course with 18+ mod hehehe",1
"bethesda has done it again, a truely magnificent open-world rpg.",1
"play this game, or the gaming world will disown you. it is a simple as that.",2
"best simulator to learn how to kill dragons. someday the dragons will return, and with this we will know how to kill them with swords. you also can learn other languages to talk to other nerds with. it is awesome, best simulator ever 10/10",1
"worth it, if only for the epic mods. civil war story is subpar and main storyline, while epic, was a bit too short. then again, dlc has promise.",1
"this game is the best ive been playing it sice it came out and im stll not tired of it",1
"forget about your own life - there is a nice and interesting substitute until tes online comes out",1
"one of the greatest rpgs this decade! a wonderful story and great gameplay, and not to forget the huge mod community!",2
"stunning graphics, nearly endless gameplay and the great landscape are nearly perfect. ive spent over 700 hours roaming the open world.",3
"im going through my games and makin reviews for the ones i like but really though who doenst have skyrim by now if youre one of those people who falls under that category then by george what the heck if you dont really like the whole rpg elder scrolls deal, then fine, but if you have a smidgeon of interest then get this game ive played 300+ hours becuase its gorgeously done and there are millions of mods that just make it so much better whatever go get it play it and stuff golly gee",2
"wanna kill dragons with a sword? do it. wanna steal stuff and put baskets on peoples heads? do that too. 40 hours in and i havent even started the main quest line. this games takes play your way to new levels. 11/10.",1
"so much to do in this game, way more than oblivian & fallout 3 combined - swear !. totally fun and totallty addictive - first single player rpg ive really enjoyed in a long time. basically i spent 48 hours playing this and i think half of that time was sidequests. just by looking at how much i skipped, i did roughly 1/3 of all the quests and beat it at level 27. you can go back and continue doing the rest of the quests after beating it... but then again you can just re-roll a new char, take different skills, and do a bunch of different quests. i feel pity for anyone who is a 100% competion person... this game would be brutal. i totally recomend this game, if i didnt have a dozen other games to play: i would re-roll a new char right now.",1
"i got this game in july 2014 and well look at my playtime. 20/10 p.s get the realistic fus ro dah mod make fus ro dah cooler.",3
"its huge and really great. the only bad thing about it that some different characters speak the same voice. and also theres a lack of music in dawnguard. vampires must have their own sound themes. but anyway-its one of the best games ive ever had. you can interact almost with everything in the game-thats awesome and also this is a real open world-you can go absolutely anywhere you want. battle system is very thoroughly managed. you can improve your skills and become anything. the great thing in this game is you choose what you want to be. also a great amount of mods in the workshop created by gamers make this game even more greater and fit to anyone.",2
"while i generally enjoyed morrowind and oblivions, despite their flaws, i couldnt imagine that skyrim could possibley hold up to the major hype that came during its release. short answer: it did. long answer, this has to be the most thourally enjoyable and engrossing game that i have ever experienced. the characters are great, the environment is amazing, and the combat capitalized on everything the elder scrolls has ever done right before. from the moment youve killed your first dragon, youll never want to leave.",2
"are you really gonna look at this saying should i buy this game if youre there is something wrong with you no offence, this is the best game ever made xd it has over 100 hours of game play and you could just run around and have many more its just a really fun game showing how good these guy are who made it!",1
"so far pretty fun. i just wish it had a action bar like rift and wow does so i could get some extra use out of my razor naga mouse. kinda dumb that im a caster and have to use both hands to cast when i was watching the new lord of the rings last night and he had a sword and staff and could still cast. still a pretty fun game once you get the  weight removed from items you carry. stupidest idea ever specially for a kleptomaniac like myself. i have like 200,000 gold and i still steal everything in sight cause i just cant help myself. if its lootable its mine",1
"i love this game the base story line the epic battle dynamics and the dlcs this is a must have game. dont get me started on the graphics there great! and you have limitless posibilitys you can be a marksman a merchant a mage or any thing your limitations are only what u make them buy this game and try it out hope ulike as much as me>",1
"possibly the most well-developed and immersive role-playing game of all time. if i had to go to sovngarde and could take but one game with me, it would be skyrim.",2
"this is by far one of the best games i have ever played!",1
"all i know is i turned into a cat and a doods head got choped off then a dragon came...",1
"best rp game ive played. lots of different ways you can make your storyline go and many dragons most importantly.",1
"i dont need to babble on and on about how amazing this game is but i might anyways. from stunning graphics to the never-ending list of well-thought-out quests, a gazillion places to explore and always able to pretty much find new things all the time... not to mention how you play changing from character to character with several races to choose from, each having unique traits and powers. if you want to slice-and-dice or simply blow someone into dust with your godly mage skills--or an unpredictable, powerful mix of brawn and magic-- i doubt youll ever get bored of this game. as the game expands endlessly, you can customize down to the very atom of yer character if you so choose. you can follow the main plot at your own pace, if at all, while you run off becoming a champion of legend and helping out gods and people alike. go slaughter everything. just kill everything if you want. go steal someones horse, take their cheese, pickpocket them. you can be a piece of  or a valiant white knight and everything in between. skyrim is your oyster, now go  dominate in whatever way you please.",2
"its a decent game with good graphic with a good story line and side quest that most of the time links up together with other quest. character customization is pretty big and when youre bored you can download mods to enjoy them at youre spare time.",1
"the game is great! i like it. dem dragons u mad bro ?",1
"my pc couldnt handle 130 mods. ign: 35/6 like fallout with swords",1
"here is a short-and-sweet review; pc version: 10/10 console version: 6/10 reasoning? mods. mods are where this game thrives. imo, vanilla skyrim is overly simplified and casual. it does however provide a nice base for modders. especially because of the ck.",3
"crash, crashes, crash bandicoot, crashes more times than lewis hamilton... but i love the game.",2
"unbelievable depth and immersion...even after all these years of playing it is still providing new thrills every time i log in",2
"one of my favorite games of all time. whether you have played past elder scrolls games or not skyrim has hundreds of hours of exploring, questing, and storyline. if youre looking for multiplayer, this is not your game, but it is a great single player game.",2
"amazing game, which is made even better by the mods the community creates.",1
"make sure u download the fetish mods, they make the game much more enjoyable",1
"i dont really need to say anything about this game, please just throw your money at it. you will thank me later.",2
"its skyrim. that alone should be enough for you to get this game if you havent already done so. the game has been out since 11.11.11 and its still going strong!",3
"they should rename this: the elder scrolls v: prepare to download 300 gb of graphics mods and bug fixes because we cant seem to get it right. i also recommend you pick up a horse leather. horse leather acts like a hilarious rubber noodle. beware of ufos, ive seen them attempting to steal mammoths. they just floated straight up into the sky and vanished. must be some kind of stealth camo.",1
"fist of, i bought skyrim on the ps3 on its realese. ive put over 130 hours into my character. i picked it up for pc the other day on converted my ps3 save to pc. this is by far the best rpg game i have ever played. its such a rich and expansive world that you can get lost in. 100s on quests and a intresting story. 100s of weapons, armours, spells. intresting and unquie npcs and many locations to discover. not to mention epic random dragons that appear through your adventures. so much to see and do in the land of skyrim. make your on path and role play as you discover why and how the dragons have returned... 10/10! must buy!",1
"my favourite non-valve game of all time. after tf2, skyrim is the next highest play time i have ever put into 1 game. despite it being an rpg and thereby in a way completeable, with storylines for bards and companions and whatnot, i still like to revisit every now and then. its a very fun game that i like a lot and you should play. i remember the time a friend came to my house, said they werent interested in skyrim, i convinced them to try it out and they proceeded to play it for 23 hours straight. mods are a thing too now, theyre pretty good. my player looks like john travolta. go play this, its very good.",1
"modded my game so instead if the normal moon its the moon from majoras mask and now i  myself everytime i look up 10/10",1
"it is a great game!..... i love it and one that every rpg fan should go and own immediately.",1
"this is a great addition to the elder scrolls. if you enjoy a good medival rpg, then this is a great game for you.",1
"very immersive game by default, and expandable via the workshop adding even more gameplay possibilities at no cost. unfortunately, the bridge cost between the standard edition and the legendary edition is too far out of balance with just purchasing the dlc components base game: 34.99 au legendary: 49.99 au (includes all dlc) dlc 1: 24.99 au dlc 2: 6.49 au dlc 3: 24.99 au = s56.47 au for just the dlc, let alone the cost of the base game, which was double the price at launch. buying the legendary edition of the game is ridiculous to get the dlc at a cheaper cost than actually buying the dlc...and its not even cheap.",1
"literally one of my favorite games of all time. theres so much content and every playthrough im finding new stuff to explore. id reccomend it to anyone.",1
"i originally bought the game for xbox when it first released. 800+ hours later i was still enjoying it, but finally got around to getting a decent gaming pc and rebought it for pc. i was then shown how to set up mods and was having even more fun playing and roleplaying different characters. occasionally i still come across content or npcs i had never encountered before. 10/10 would suggest everyone play this game. it doesnt matter for which console if you are just looking for some fun, but for an in-depth experience that you can keep adding to, i definitely recommend it for pc and modding it.",1
"while i greatly enjoyed the game, as i do with the whole of the elder scrolls series, i much prefer the daedric feel of oblivion. i cannot wait until skyblivion is complete. other than that, skyrim had excellent graphics, marvellous gameplay, and the confusing storyline to end all confusing storylines. great game.",2
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",1
"now having over 200 hrs put in to tesv (and also some 200+ on console) i can almost say this is the best rpg even in 2015 , the game had alot of content that bethesda added but the modding society going strong for almost 3yrs you can keep playing the game and have a new adventure everyday. bethesda added alot of content themselfs (somethings they forgot) but the modding society makes the game more fun everyday , the gameplay is good for the beginning rpg player or the hardcore rpg player , you have so much variety of playstyles the choice is all yours. if i rate this game 1010 sweetrolls ill give it a : 11/10 sweetrolls",1
"stole a horse and became more important enemy of the empire than dragon. 10/10",1
"easily my favourite rpg game on pc. graphics are incredible, and even more so with graphics mods (pc only). so much to do in this game, many elements and paths you can take, i love how some decisions can alter entire parts of the game. there are a ton of quests and you can get mods that add a lot more even on top of that. this game is probably in my top 3 favourite game of all time. highly recommended. 10/10",1
"dont be a console peasant. play skyrim on pc with  tons of mods to make the game look gorgeous. if you havent played this, something is seriously wrong with you. 11/10",2
"this game ... instant classic so great and still so beatiful in 2014 :)",1
"as a hardcore gamer i spend alot of time in games like syrim. and guess what? skyrim ruined my life..... good thing i have two extra lives.",1
"blue screened because of downloading 78 mods. awesome 10/10",1
"so many places to wander in,i can be so nosey i loves it!",1
"all this stupid game does is crash! crash!! c r a s h!!",4
"just like many others have probably mentioned, this game is amazing due to the fact that the level of customization is almost limitless (with mods of course!). with mods for graphics, gear, characters, quests, difficulty etc. you can turn this into whole new game. the vanilla game itself is no pushover, easily 100+ hours of content and most of the quests have their own uniqueness to it. lots of value for money, good graphics and still among the best rpgs i have played in (and for) years.",2
"one of my favorite games. it is so much fun and overall its a beast game.",1
"amazing game and amazing modding community, but its a mixed blessing. it ctds all the time, and for me its often unplayable for reasons unknown. so, if you go into this game, be prepared for the eventuality that something will go wrong.",1
"whats better than being dragonborn and saving the world... oh wait, anime. <3",1
"i have purchased the game, but i have been weighing the odds of playing it, can someone tell me how graphic the enemies look? (i have a mom who wont let me play most games because of the fact that she says they look too demonic). add me on steam for your answer, since i dont read responses on here.",1
"one of the best games ever, period. if you dont own skyrim already, open your wallet right now and buy it!",1
"skyrim is a great game in the elder scrolls series. it is preferable to get this on pc rather than console just for the user-created content. there are plenty of things to keep you occupied. there are quest line for the main quest, the civil war quests, each factions quests, and plenty of side quests and areas. the main game also has 3 expansions to increase things to do as well. i put about 150 hours into the console version and another 150 on the pc version. similar to: oblivion (es4), fallout, fallout new vegas, dishonored.",1
"you will spend a stupid amount of time on this game if youre a completionist like this guy",1
"this game will take you to another world of advantures dragons and miracles, dispite your job, wife and kinds in real world.",1
"the be all end all of elder scrolls games until the next one. mods are a must i mean, this is the pc version after all.",1
"skyrim is an absolutely outstanding rpg. im 166 hours in and still havent beaten it because i keep getting distracted by all of the side quests, caves, and dungeons. its even better once you start modding it and adding things like even higher resolution textures and more dramatic, dynamic weather.",1
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played. the amount of time you can sink in this game is just insane giving this game in my opininon a 11 out of 10 rating.",1
"beautiful music, enticing environment, and one of the most intriguing worlds ive ever seen in video games. i found myself immersed into a world i had never dreamed of. thank you bethesda for creating one of the best games i have ever enjoyed!",1
"a fantastic game. the graphics are stunning and the gameplay is nearly endless. you can spends hours running around completing quests or riding your horse trying to hunt down dragons. if you want to experience this game in its full glory you may need a beefier cpu an gpu, but you will still enjoy it with lesser components. this game allows you to create your own play style whether you sneek in and stab people from behind or run in with a elven broadsword hacking your foes to pieces you can play an unlimited amount of ways. it is well worth the price.",1
"you try to sneek then you get spotted. then you kill everyone. everyone. you then regret it later, after marrying ysolda and killing her.",1
"one of the best games i have ever played! there is a huge amount of stuff to do and the modding is really easy for those who want some extra material for their old game. i recommend this song to everyone who like rpgs and fantasy games. the combat is a little balloonish but still a good game.",3
"skyrim provides very enjoyable rpg gaming content for you to play. very good gameplay combined with great graphics provides many hours of fun. as well as this, it has a lot of replay value, as there are many different ways for you to play, from a high elf mage to a nord warrior, this game packs a lot of bang for your buck.",1
"after playing this game. it makes me realize that everygame needs to be open world now.",1
"this game can provide at least 9 hours of entertainment! :d that is... unless you mod it. seriously, go grab the nexus mod manager and enjoy a great experiance.",1
"no review necessary. if you do not like it then you are lost. if you do, then gods save your soul. ;)",1
"great game! i like how it is open-world and how there are lots of mods.",1
"best game for me! it has some lag but, i think its just my computer xd.",1
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"the best game ever made i cant even begin to describe the most epic journies i have had with skyrim i have almsot beaten the whole game played every race and modded the crap out of it truly my favorite and best game ever made. totally recomended",1
"this game doesnt need a recommendation. there are some caves with spiders putting their own torches. 200/10 must play.",1
"this is an epic game!!!!!!!!! its one of my favorites but not my absolluter favorite. the great thing about is mostley never lag.",1
"one of the most addictive rpgs ive ever played. you can choose your own story that will lead you to fighting the dragon of all dragons and race too. theres way!!! more stuff to do if you buy this game (which you should). will reccomend this to all my friends and will also reccomend playing the legendary edition, but i you just want to play the regular version of skyrim, then do it. this could possibly be the greatest rpg ever and the greatest singleplayer game ive ever played. well what are you waiting for, buy the freaking game for crying out loud!!! (only wait if you dont have the money).",1
"extensive exploration and roleplaying in a world populated by the mentally challenged.",1
"i am very fond of this because of the amount of detail and work put in to this open world game. the only con is that it tends to lag on my computer a lot. but over all i love this game. with missions, battles and pickpocketing. this game deserves applause. a feature i love the most is the interactive experience with npc and you better hope your attitude towards their village is good because otherwise they come armed. i hope youll enjoy this game is much as i do. i rate the elder scrolls v: skyrim a 8 1/2 out of 10. it has really done a good job.",1
"love the game, i have deadra armor and much more. if you dont have this game, you neeeed to play this!",1
"there i was minding my own business as i took a leisurely stroll through this vast mountain forest, when i spot a troll and decide to say hello! of course, this troll decides that ive apparently done some sin against him and proceeds to bat me into the air with his club. i learned a valuable lesson that day. never cross paths with a troll. they a grouchy old men.",1
"a vast world full of adventure, strugle, and conflict. it is up to you to put to an end of all this and turn the province of skyrim back to its former glory!",1
"possibly the best game i have ever played in my life. 10/10 would buy again for full price. my only question is, i seem to have somehow acquired the dawnguard dlc without ever purchasing it. i didnt torrent it or anything like that, one day it was just...there, on the game. i have no explanation for it. i love the dlc and think it is a must have addition to the game, i just was curious about why i know have it for some reason. has anyone else experienced this?",1
"very fun game to play. giant open world and amazing mods to be downloaded.",3
"a dumbed down casual garbage game with no deep combat whatsoever. it has a big open world with a lot of explore, but it gets boring fast. if you are looking for a cool deep game with good combat just get dark souls instead. id recommend this game, but its nothing for me. 7/10.",1
"by far my favorite lord of the rings movie. 10/10 would bang.",1
"could i say more..crazy game...rpg to the fullest...but glitches cld be a minor problem...work arnds available ...so no worries...but what a game ..the best ever made..maybe!!",1
"no has lived till they have played this game its not even a game its a thing that you cant live without it like air.",1
"a masterpiece of modern rpg gaming. if you liked morrowind and fallout 3 / new vegas you will enjoy this a lot. it perfectly paints a picture of a vibrant world. the quests themselves are compelling and will keep you guessing right until their conclusion. feel free to roam around the countryside hunting dragons and mining til your pockets are full!",1
"awesome open-world rpg. huge world with numerous points of interest to visit. good amount of customization with the ability to play how you want (melee, ranged, spell caster, etc.) enjoyable main story line, with a satisfying end, unlike most games. there are lots of gripes and nitpicks about the pc version. many things could be better and more fleshed out, but the game is enjoyable to casual and hardcore players alike. i find this game a bit clunky at times, but is overall much more enjoyable all-around than i found oblivion to be. lots more to say, but youll just have to play it for yourself to judge. i give it a 9/10 because its definitely not perfect, and theres a lot more to be desired, but its not an unplayable game by any means, and definitely has a hundred hours worth of content, if thats what youre into.",1
"its the best game ever made...not much else to say.",3
"day 1: -spawned in random field. -saw a naked guy like me. -killed him and took his banana. -saw a guy with a greatsword -rushed him with banana in hand. -died. day 2: -saw a guy with an axe. -guy rushed me, i shot at him and hit him once. he broke his leg. -put him in cuffs and fed him bleach. -he had a friend. -shot in the leg. -cuffed and poisoned. -random chick comes along and kills both. -chick fixes me up and i get healthy and armed again. -we meet her friends. -cuffed and force fed a banana. -died -psychotic laughter. and then i started playing skyrim 10/10",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an open world rpg that you can do whatever it is you want, let it be screwing around(like what i do) hunting, exploring, etc. the choice is yours. i feel like a fool having this game sit in my library collecting dust(i was running low on space at the time and had no choice but to do so until i upgraded my pc, which it is right now) this game is just amazing at times you may encounter glitches in the world but the lot of them are quite hilarious. the possibilities in this game are endless, as i said, you will enjoy this game if you like rpgs. you can choose to be a magician casting destruction spells such as fire, electricity, a warrior who uses his/hers trusty sword and shield, a brute who wields a massive two handed greatsword, warhammer, or battleaxe, or a magic fighter(which i am) who uses a sword/axe/dagger of your choice and magic in the other hand either it is destruction, or restoration to aid in combat. skyrim is a must have to those who enjoy rpgs.",1
"omfg worth to get this game it is so good xd buy now while its 3.74",1
"if it only had co-op it would have been the best game evah made!. best singleplayer rpg so far. you will not be dissapointed.",1
"skyrim is one of my favourite games. despite its bugs, issues, and downfalls, i think that its one of the longest lasting games with a lot of replay value. ive had the game for months and still havent run out of things to do. the graphics are gorgeous even on the lowest of settings.",1
"best current singleplayer game in the elder scrolls franchise. great story line id say, with multiple side quests to do along the way. when you beat the main storyline, the game doesnt end. you can do the 32+ side quests, with each breaking off into different tasks. at almost any point in the game, you can go dungeon raiding or treasure hunting. join different factions to get more side quests. buy the dlcs, and you get even more side quests and exclusive items. if you havent had enough after all of that, go on down to the steam workshop to download mods and addons. one click of a button, and the mod is automatically installed! or, if you want, create your own mods. mods can also be found on the skyrim nexus, however they have to be installed manually. all in all, the elder scrolls v: skyrim is an amazing game that even has its own hd texture pack. i would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves open-world games set in a medieval nordic country. (and dont forget about the dragons!) : )",1
"you ought to love this game and its beautiful graphics. the story is complex and interesting. the journey pulls you into this gorgeous world of dragons and mythical creatures. moreover, the landscape is simply breathtaking!!",1
"epic. a great core game with amazing dlc and countless mods... how could you not own this?",1
"about 1400~ hours played (console+steam) and im still having fun at this. the game itself is huge enough to spend hundreds of hours with it, but when you reached the point where you get bored by the vanilla game.. then the real fun begins: mods. the game is awesomely supported through a huge community and allows you too do almost everything you want. flying? jepp. become a werebear? no problem. become a lich? why not? blood not realistic enough? take this mod. its the best action-rpg-game i know so far, id definitly recommend it. ps: its engine is so amazing that you can even run it on a low spec machine smoothly (if not you can install some perfomance mods)",1
"everyone knows this amazing game, and if you dont then id like to see the impressive boulder you are living under.",1
"so much fun, you can basically do whatever you want and there is tons of hours to play",1
"if you havent played this game, what are you waiting for?! go out and get it!!!",1
"having played over 1,000+ hours on console and now having picked up the pc version and getting to play around with some of the mods, i can now without a doubt say that this is my absolute favorite game... ever. this game has me at a loss for words to explain its amazingness, it truly is a spectacular game. graphics wise it is ever so slightly outdated but, not to the point where it is a pain, just some really low res textures here and there. the gameplay is incredible, out side of the melee combat which is a god-awful ms1 spamming pile of crap, that is compromised mainly of aiming your courser to make sure it hits and watching their health bar as you spam away. the in-game elements such as the magic and the shouts are very fun to play around with for example, one of the starting shouts, if not the starter, unrelenting force, allows you to ragdoll people to your hearts content, whether it be a bandit, or even giant naked men. anyways, more to the point, this game is tons of fun if your someone who enjoys deep rpg experiences like myself, if you are someone who likes more fast-paced and more linear games, or basically any genre that isnt rpg, id still say give this a try, you never know.",1
"best game, will continue playing untill they release more games.",1
"look no further kids, cause it sure as  doesnt get any better than this. this is motherin skyrim. the be all, end all,  all to death rpg of the modern age, and if you havent played it yet, you dont deserve your genitals. check this  out, before dragons burn you alive in your sleep. peace.",1
"very fun game. here is a quick list of pros and cons. pros ~unique talent system (at least to my experience) ~a lot of dialogue, lets you have an rpg-friendly gaming experience ~fast travel; you dont have to spend countless hours traveling from point a to point b ~addicting character customization cons ~repetative quests; go halfway across skyrim, kill or retrieve something, travel back to turn in ~boring combat system ~too many dragons lol",1
"skyrim is the perfect game for you if: -you want to punch a dragon in the face. -you want to get your sweetroll back. -you dont really have a social life to waste elsewhere. -you want to be a cat-person. -you want to worship talos, lord of light. or, if you just want a cool rpg with great progression and exploration. 9.5/10",1
"do it or dont, just remember if you dont you will regret it!",4
"i love this game beat it and got up to level 40 on xbox and am so glad i got a gaming pc for christmas so now i cant share my love of the elderscrolls series with mods.",1
"great adventure game where you can slay dragons and i love slaying dragons.. indeed i do ... this game is good.. kinda glitchy... still good.",1
"buy this game, its like if oblivion was good instead of bad.",1
"i recommend this game to anyone who likes to explore and for people who think that theres nothing to do when you finish the main story quests, youo can add mods and such to keep on going",1
"best game ive played on pc, the mods make it even a better game.",1
"an amazing rpg! bethesda really did a good job on skyrim. i love open world games and skyrim did not fail me. the fact that you can fight dragons is awesome and how you can gain their soul for unlocking shouts was a cool idea from bethesda. the weapons were also a blast to play with. the amount of weapons and armor you can enchant really made the game fun and how you can use magic spells instead of using a sword or a mace really changed the way you played the game. if you wanted to go for a long range weapon, you could pick a bow and arrow to take out your enemies, or if you are more of the stealth type, a dagger would be a excellent weapon for you. this game is also amazing because it looks beautiful! with the high resolution texture pack, it makes your dovahkiin sexier than ever. when you play skyrim, you never know what to expect and what random loot you will find. i am the dragonborn wearing a hat with badass horns! im dovahakiin known globally youre nobody at all!",2
"you start out as a prisoner pending execution. i suggest patiently waiting in line to meet your fate. was amazing.",1
"fantastic game. so much to do, you can re-play and re-play a multitude of times and still find different things to do every playthrough, guaranteed. and then, there are the thousands and thousands (no hyperbole) of mods available, with which you can customise almost every imaginable facet of your character and/or gameworld. and if you ever feel that youre running out of stuff to complete or places to see (i doubt this will ever become an issue), a new mod or dlc will be released which will add dozens of hours of extra play-time to the game. theres tonnes and tonnes of stuff to do and see in the vanilla version of the game, too, if modding isnt your thing. in the time ive spent playing skyrim i could have quite easily mastered a foreign language, learnt to drive a car or settled down with a wife and kids. id still choose skyrim any day.",2
"skyrim! the best game of bethesda! better then any fallout game i ever played (only new vegas :d )",1
"this is skyrim, what do you expect. its big, awesome, but after a time gets really boring. except if you install mods. with mods it stays awesome, even after the 30 hours of main quests. recommend, but only with the intention to install mods after a while.",1
"i first heard of skyrim from my brother. he had bought it on his xbox and told me that you got to play this game. so i picked it up from target for the ps3 which i switched because i really wanted to mod skyrim. when i first played it i thought that it was okay it was fun, but when i got deep into the story i was mind blown. the lore is just soo deep, and interactive. the combat is great and i overall really enjoyed it. i recommend that when you finish the game get the other games; that way you can live experience what you read in the books. however there are a few glitches that you may encounter, (nothing console commands wont fix though). overall though great game, keepm coming bethesda.",1
"possibly one of the finest games ive ever played, with many realms to explore, and the workshop content makes this game a must have on steam!",1

"skyrim is a game that has a lot of everything. the art in skyrim is phenomenal. the game play is alright, but the atmosphere of the game is almost unbearable. the outside world is beautiful, but the caves are way too ing dark. i find myself running into walls for 10-15 minutes because the light is too low to see if its ing door/passage or not. god dammit skyrim. your still awesome.",1
"some of the best graphics and gameplay ive seen in a long time 95/100",1
"the most amazing game i have ever played. if anything, the lihting is a bit off- i suggest modding it, from the skyrim nexus. i would recommend this game any day of the week, and week of the month, any month of the year.",1
"ive been a fan of the elder scrolls games since morrowind, but there were gameplay issues that hindered my ability to become fully engrossed in the lore. bethesda fixed all of those issues in skyrim. i spent hours just exploring the world, looking for rarities, conversing with the npcs and reading the seemingly endless tomes of literature. couple this game with an active development community that is continously releasing mods and youll never run out of ways to entertain yourself.",3
"i cant imagine if someone hated this game. its a never ending game whether you beat the main quest or not there is always something to do in skyrim. mess around, do quests, buy items, and ect you will never get bored! the graphics are fantastic and the atmosphere is great. there are so many fun, scary, and suprising quest that i wont spoil so you will have to see for yourself. the game is even better with dlc. that adds even more quests, weapons, spells, and armor to get. lucky for me i had gotten this game for only $8.00 for 2013s christmas sale. even if you have to get it for $30.00 its still worth it. if you happen to have the cash for it, you should totally buy it! :d",1
"this game is awesome i dont why you are still looking at the reviews. just buy it now. if you want great graphics? check if you want interactivity? check if you want to be a powerful mage or an unbeatable warrior? check if you want to get married settle with your children in the houses you built(for heartfire users)? check if you want to become an assassin or a thief,or a vampire or a werewolf? check.",1

"not much can be said about skyrim that hasnt already been said. i will, however, say this: bethesda has created a masterpiece, in my eyes at least. with a game spanning such a huge, dynamic world full of monsters, people and unique locations, skyrim will keep you busy for weeks! all of the core mechanics from the previous elder scrolls incarnation (the mighty oblivion of course) are present, however most have seen a significant revamp. the combat feels much more visceral, and the world itself just feels alive. a truly great game!",1
"one of the best games ever made. as long as you can install mods from steam youll have 500+ hours of enjoyment, and even more the second time round. 10 / 10",1

"if you value your social life, this isnt the game for you. bethesda comes back with another title that makes you lose the motivation to do anything but complete every  quest in this game. skyrim is masterpiece of an rpg that sets the bar higher than it ever was before, with gameplay and the rpg aspect of skyrim being its main attractor youll be pleasantly surprised to find some really enjoyable questlines in your playthrough and if you enjoy elderscrolls games all i have to say is make sure you keep yourself healthy cause im not kidding when i say that days, as in 24 hour days can go by in a flash when you get in the zone. oh my and the dlcs just add another 150 hours to the 300+ hour experience skyrim has to offer. modding will be the end of you, firstly remember to backup but after that mods will keep you entertained for as long as you wish. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is literally the most hours for dollar you will ever get from a game - the community is and has been active since its release just churning out quality mods for the game, as well as that the vanilla game has already too much to do for a single lifetime and i guarantee after that estimated 300 hours of gameplay youll stll be finding new things to do.",2

"best game ever just simple as that..... you can do lots of things there you can going mineing,be a forger,be a dragon hunter go look for some mods to make the game better lots of thing you can do you just need to find them or just go kill people if you want to be that type of person =d hope i see more poeple get the game its really really fun and if you have the dlc its makes it even better cause you can be a vampier hunter and a vampier or go to different land thats part of the tes which is morrowwind and the best part of this game is the..................... music =d",2
"great game. the addition of fan mods makes it even better.",1
"skyrim, the game where you can create a character, go on quests, beat the living s*** out of everything you see. upgrade skill levels, loot dungeons, tick off the guards, choose your own path. the game is fun and worth buying. but there is one think im going to warn you about. the lutes.",1
"this is my favorite game of all time bethesda realy hit the nail on the head with this franchise i strongly recomend getting this game if you dont already have it definately one you need to have in your games list",1
"this game is literally one of the all time greatest. modding allows for damn near infinite replayablitiy. there is so much room for activites that i almost cant handle it.",1
"skyrim is one of the most impersive games that you could expecience. but youre going to hate the first few quests. i love skyrim but the opening could have been much better. the opening aside, the rest of the game is creative, new and completely fresh. nothing about this game is like other rpg adventure titles. skyrim is a game where choice is real, you have the chance to do anything and everything. you can join the theives guild and the companions, join the dark brotherhood and the dawngaurd. its simply like living another life. i just bought this game on pc after having the xbox version for almost 2 years and i dont regret it, skyrim is so i can buy it twice and be satisfied, i did this with other titles and had buyers remorce but not skyrim. this game only got better on pc. and from someone who knows everything about skyrim i cant stress this enough, its completely worth buying if you already have it, i do recommend getting it when its on sale. like i did. and just saying this for people who havent played, the dlc for this game are completely worth it.",1
"super fun worth every dollar if u got a good laptop/computer to run it on beautiful graphics just for setting it to low loved playing it though my laptop cant run it without lagging sadly, killing a dragon is my fav part in the game and using magic and discovering new stuff items people etc. etc.",1
"moddable enough to be the fantasy game you always wanted to play. highly recommended.",2
"still a great game, especially with how many mods are now available! steam workshop makes it easy, and it looks and plays great on pc.",1
"10 out of 10. this game is the best of all time. skyrim has a great story, imersive world, fantastic world. if you are a fan of rpgs skyrim is a must buy.",4
"i love this game!!! so endless!! the music, the quests, everything...can spend hours just exploring and go and kill some draugr, deathlords, spiders, etc, so many things you can kill too xd or make friends...for me there was little bugs, so i was really happy about it. i really recommend, if you like to explore and just have fun doing side quests, some are like fetch this fetch that, but on the way you can talk to certain people and get more quests! its fun overall :3 really recommend this to everyone ^_^bb <3",1
"one of my all time favourite games, so much content that it makes you want to play it over and over again a definate 10/10 must buy.",1
"downloaded a mod where there was a giant deamon chicken atacking everybody in the city 20/10",1
"this is one of the best rpg games you will ever find out there. you start out as a prisoner, captured by the imperials on your way to skyrim. you start to realize theres a huge conflict between the imperials and a rebellion team known as the stromcloaks who call themselfs the sons and daughters of skyrim. you then venture through the lands of skyrim, slay dragons, and kill the world-eater, alduin. you can then join many other things, such as the imperial army, or the stormcloak rebellion, you can join the college of winterhold, the thiefs guild, or the dark brotherhood. this is just a small portion of the game, excluding all dlcs which im hoping to buy soon and enjoy the rest of this amazing game. if you nearly even liked just a little morrowind, or oblivion you will love this game.",1
"skyrim is a fun game and it is for consil and computer",1
"a vast and beautiful world where you can get caught up with a severe case of wanderlust. game of 2011, and thats a bold statement considering this has been an amazing year for games.",1
"skyrim is one of those games you could play constantly for weeks, or even months and its still fun. then even after you get bored of it you can return months later, start a new adventure and have just as much fun as last time, if not more. throw mods on top of it, the game just gets even better. the open world exploration is fantastic and there is always something new to discover, its truly an adventure game and i recommend it for anyone who likes fantasy games and open world games.",2
"i really like this game, it is so open and theres so much to do",1
"in my opinion, if you want one of the best rpg experiences, get skyrim.",1
"this game is stupid, its not realistic at all. dragons? who cares about dragons? only fat ugly nerds with no lives care about dragons and castles. giant spiders? werewolves? vampires? talking lizard humans? how the f**k is this realistic?! i cant believe you idiots actually like this s**t! this game doesnt even have guns. are you serious?! no guns? aaaaaaaggh! that makes me sooooooo angry! every game needs to have guns! i love fps games, theyre soooooooo unique, innovating, and totally not repetitive as s**t at all! skyrim is single-player only, no multiplayer. *sigh* is bethesda f*cking stupid?! no one plays games for single-player! this is 2014, people only want multiplayer. apparently, bethesda is still stuck in 1998. not to mention, these graphics look disgusting. my dogs poop looks better than this games graphics. you cant even blow up buildings in this game. how stupid. look at battlefield 4, that game is very realistic and very innovating. f**k open world rpg games, only fat ugly nerds play that. real mature gamers play fps games like cod, halo, and battlefield because theyre very realistic, very innovating, and not repetitive as s**t at all! thank you for reading my review :d",1

"the greybeards fus,ro,dah me off the mountain after i swing my axe on one of the greybeards. (master borri) 999092143083/10 would fall again. seriously,i played this game since it was released on 11/11/11 on my xbox 360,bought the legendary edition,play the hell out of it again,and then bought it again on steam,and play the hell out of it. again. with bazzillion of mods. btw,happy new years everyone,its been 3 years since my first playthrough in skyrim and you might see me currently playing skyrim while you were reading this.",1
"as with previous bethseda titles tesv needs a good dose of modding to truly unleash its potential. having said that the base game along with the dlcs are more than worth its current pricing. for a 2011 title it has solid graphics supported by an excellent sound track by jeremy soule. the soundtrack is well composed and has alot of themes veterans of the elder scrolls series would be familiar with. unfortunately in terms of story immersion the game is greatly let down by the rail roaded quests and options as well as the limitations in dialogue options. another major gripe that has since been rectified by mods is the user interface. while the interface is not unusable the vanilla interface appears to have been designed to cater for console users. overall a good purchase for all rpg users.",4
"after helping return an item to someone, you can put a kettle over their head and take the item back, despite this, they still thank you for returning said item as if you never took it. 10/10",2
"i love this game its the best of all the elder scrolls games. just make sure you have a few hours before you start because you wont wanna put it down very easily. slaying dragons is a blast and quests are fun, but sneaking and bow hunting is where its at :)",1
"its just... one of those games that once you beat the campaign, theres still so much to do. and with dlc and mods, you can keep playing forever. i used to play skyrim... but then i took nothing to the knee (i still play skyrim).",1
"its a great game; lots of stuff to do! dlc is engaging and always offers new fun as well. must get game for rpg lovers.",1
"after finding some interesting mods to increase my immersion in the ice covered mountains of skyrim, i proceeded to start a new game. as this is a roleplaying game, i decided to tap into my inner being, and played as the khajit race, which are a race of human sized cats, as cats is my favorite broadway musical, and ive longed to be mungojerrie, so i figured id roleplay as the dastardly cat burgler himself. upon finishing my character creation, i was thrust onto the ground, and here a feint: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah! in the distance. over come with fear, the guards stop the execution, and look up, only to see macho man randy savage fly in and begin his nightmarish reign of fire and destruction. any game that replaces dragons with macho man randy savage and his sound clips is a solid buy in my book. 11/10",1
"one of the best games out there, well worth the price. 10/10",1
"great game even better with enbs or other graphic mods! =d",3
"if youre a fan of the elder scrolls series, or just interested in checking it out, i recommend skyrim. while morrowind will always be my favorite tes game, skyrim is probably the most accessible of the series, not too mention my 2nd favorite. though oblivion had a slightly better quest log, skyrim is the superior game overall of the two.",1
"skyrim is a all round fantastic game it is asteticaly pleasing and with the story but when you get to the modding side of it, it just crashes i do enjoy but with the modding it should tell you what the mod is compatilble and not compatible with .",1
"this game is absolutely beautiful! before, when i had the normal game (without dlc) it was awesome, but now i just installed all three dlcs and it is ultra-awesome!!!!!!! i highly recommend this game to anyone you is thinking to buy this game. skyrim forever !!",1
"after several hundred hours, i keep finding reasons to play this game.",1
"love it! if you like swords, magic, death, and fire explotions, get. this. game. unlike some games its almost exactly like the trailer.",1

"alogn with the rest of the tes games, this one brings hours upon hours of fun and/or frustration into your life. plus once you finish everything the vanilla way, there are hours upon hours of modded content that completely change and change your experience. plus the cheese.... the cheese!",1

"well, lets see, i literally lost my life to oblivion skyrims predecessor. so i had high hopes for this. very high hopes. im not really sure if they were fulfilled. but maybe they were unrealistic. it is huge i put 60 hours into in the first week. i ended up playing for 9 or 10 hours straight until damn near 4 a.m. it is bugged, but thats not fair to crucify the game for it. its huge and bugs are to be expected. i have not once ran into a game, or even a quest ending bug. not once im 60+ hours in. bugs are sometimes random and now a third patch was released so they are getting smaller and smaller. this game also has a huge modbase, one of which i am apart of. fighting isnt as fun as i had hoped but its still very good. quest and storyline is awesome and the leveling system is the best seen in an elder scrolls in my opinion. graphics let me down a bit, not dx11 support as of now, hopin they will soon but dx9 is still very good. i give this a 9.5/10 because of no dx11.",1
"between the vanilla version, compatibility with pc, and the mods, this wins best game on steam from me.",1
"the vanilla game is honestly not very good. the dungeons are all the same, the gameplay is boring, the swordfights are very boring. even the dragon fights are stale. however, if you mod the absolute  out of this game, its very fun.",1
"skyrim is the antithesis of all that is elder scrolls and all that is role-playing games. if you are looking for a true sequel to the deep, immersive, true role-playing masterpieces that are daggerfall and morrowind, dont even budge. if you are looking for a absurdly dumbed down, easily exploitable action-adventure game with no depth, no weight on any of your choices, very shallow characters, randomly generated quests with repetitive patterns, a dull color scheme, copy-and-paste dungeons, a nonexistent story, and design choices obviously aimed for the shallow, casual crowd of players who have no idea what to do except click mouse1 (or right trigger,) then this game is for you. the music is good though. instead of skyrim, i recommend you get daggerfall instead. it actually has depth, story, an enourmous game world (in fact its the biggest game world ever made,) thought, and a price of $0. most importantly however, its an actual roleplaying game... and its actually good. dont waste your money on overhyped garbage.",1
"great gameplay, great map, great story, one downside is bugs, would recommend it",1
"quite possibly my favorite game on my games list, a fantastic addition to any gamer, it adds strategy and a thought process into everything you do. tons of items, areas to explore, and dungeons this game is fantastic. mods merely enhance the game play, the default game is more than entertaining enough with at least 100 hours of gameplay. 9.5/10.",1

"its not as good as people claim. but its not as bad as everyone else says it is either. its currently quite overhated just for being popular (though there are legit reasons out there, if you can sift through the typical excuses you see with cod haters.) if you like the elder scrolls universe, then get it. its worth it, and vanilla skyrim is surprisingly fun without the use of mods. there are improvements from its predecessors and definitely a step in the right direction for the elder scrolls. is it there yet? not quite. it has its issues, it has its downgrades, but get past that and youve got a game thatll keep you entertained for a long time.",1
"this game is fantastic, and the dlc just makes it so much better. theres an infinite things you can do, rather than just the story line. youll find yourself 30 hours deep and still on the first few story quests, and having a great time along the way.",1

"this is one of my top games, i love it, and played through it multiple times, something i dont do often. skyrim has some amazing graphics and the modding community has even taken this further. (assuming you have the pc for it) but its not the graphics that make this game, its the rich and beautiful world full of mythical creatures. while it is true that bethesda has a bit of a reputation for releasing buggy games, the modding community has set that straight with their unofficial skyrim patches. if you are a fan of rpgs or series such as the lord of the rings, or narnia, then i recommend you get this game.",2

"skyrim ... oh, how do i even ... lets just say its a very good game. very good. the amount of hours ive placed into the game on my xbox 360 and then my pc? over a thousand hours for sure. loved almost everything about it. the best game to come out of bethesdas studios. so why the thumbs down you ask? well ... its really good when the game wants to be good. otherwise its glitchy, buggy, and downright a pain to deal with. most of it is sadly, bethesdas fault. i admit most of the issues can come from the player, but even without mods or being risky- you will still crash or have issues on a daily basis. this is coming from a guy with a new, beefy computer. i couldnt take it anymore after installing the game with every mod cleared out, and reading up on how to prevent the issues... only for it to crash on me at the start. no, just no... im done. so if you want to risk it, go ahead. i give it a 8/10. would of been a solid 10/10 if it wasnt for the dreadful ground breaking stuff like bugs/glitches/crashes. if it works fine, its a great game indeed.",2

"mage / murder / thief / companions herald / multiple thane title / dragonslayer / and many many more. infinity way to create your character the best. you can be mage / warrior (aka battlemage) necromancer / ranger (go minions, im behind). if you want to spend much time without bein bored - its game for ya",1
"we all know this game and how  it was on the consoles. we all agree that this game is 100 times better on pc due to mods and enhancements that can be modified and added. this game is incredible in its own way. yes, it has a considerable amount of glitches and bugs which can be fixed using official patches from the skyrim nexus. there are a lot of things you are missing from this game. it has incredible mods that you will never get to experience. which is a shame since it is one of the biggest workshops on steam. there are mods that add more killmoves, characters, races, weapons, armours, animals + beasts, immersive mods, enviroments, gameplay aspects, and more. there are enbs which enhance skyrim immensely. literarily, a brain . there are mods that can create better characters that dont look like hobos from downtown. this game is excellent for those who seek adventure, great mods, and roleplaying.",2

"i huge step up from morrowind and id go as far to say the mods are even better! as usual there will always be something to do, you can take any path you want do whatever you however you want! the diversity to the story and the world of skyrim itself is jaw droppingly amazing. if you own a pc and you dont have skyrim youre missing out on months of hibernation playing this. i own this on my ps3 as well so that im not tempted to cheat either haha!",1
"there are dragons by the ton to kill. its also elder scrolls. and compared to the console version (which i have played the ps3 version) it runs like a dream. 500 stars",1
"compared to oblivion this is an improvement, but it still has its faults. most of the rpg elements have been dubbed down or removed. the gameplay itself is fine but they have added aspects like regenerating health to make it more appealing to a wider audience. the games modding community, like oblivion is a blast! you can get rid of these casualized aspects with a few mods, also the game looks absolutely beautiful, im excited to see fallout 4 run on this engine! if you want a good time buy this but if you want and es game with more rpg elements, go get marrowind. not saying to avoid this game but if youre looking for something more complex this isnt that appealing, should you buy it if you loved marrowind and/or oblivion? of course! just beware. 9.3/10",1
"in my honest opinion, this is the best rpg ive played so far, thrilling, challenging, can cause obsession. you have alot of mods you can choose from if you get bored of the game itself, which its unlikely to happen. rpg fans, shame on you if you havent tried skyrim yet.",2
"i love this game! we debate daily about tes games on our fb page, look for us! the elder scrolls debates",1
"i wont bother with a long review, since there are so many good ones, just add my voice to say this is one of the all time greatest rpgs. ive played over 200 hours, and enjoyed every minute.",1
"with a little imagination you can lose hundreds of hours in skyrim. 5/5*",1
"one of the best games i have ever played! i have put over 200 hours into this game, and there is still so much more things to do. countless quest with amazing dialouge and exploration, along with an epic story full of action and battles. i have never played a game this much fun in my entire life! this game is even worth the full price. a 10/10 rating this game should have :d",2
"very awsome rpg and also has a lot of really great mods",1
"after aquiring uthgerd you then become jesus. all the dragons lose there scaley genitalia. they are no match for you and uthgerd",1
"since i got this game ive played it quite a lot, and i must say i still enjoy playing it a bit, every now and then ... but only a bit of play at a time :p it is one of the best games ive played so far, and its fantastic modding community keeps it alive and breathing. ive even made a mod myself! :) though it has its flaws (the so-called elder scrolls bugs, or ... whatever it is they call it :p) i highly recommend everyone to try it out!",3
"skyrim is a non-linear game that is full of side quests and places to visit on top of the main storyline. lots of skills to level up, like weapon and armorcrafting along with many others. hundreds of gameplay hours with all the dlcs.has too much content to go into full detail. so far this is my favorite game of all time.i recommend this game to anyone who likes fantasy rpgs.",2
"just awesome, any positive word could describe it.",1
"sure wish i had gotten this during the summer sale but whatever. its great. get it.",4
"this game is old but still maneges to grab my attention and its come down to the community content that makes this game all the more interesting its definetly worth the money if ya like roleplaying games then this is the one for you",2
"where should i start ? before i start the review i played this game over 5 times on the xbox360 but why did i buy it also on the pc well because of the mods dlcs and more that made me play this game another 3 times then i found out that skyrim is really easy to mod so yeah... i played even more until i also found a mod that you can level up till level 350 i had 700 hours but a bug happend and it rested all my hours so yeah.... want to play a game that literally endless replay ability well  this the game for you  man i got sucked into it more then a leech to a fat guy with diabetes 10/10 game of the years 2011 - 2014",1
"best money spent on a game in a long time unlimited game play due to its modding community. the modding community are alwase adding more and more wonderfull content. i have to agree with best game of the year for 2013.",1
"do you know what you can do with workshop things in this game its just amazing",1
"possibly the greatest fantasy rpg of all time. the graphics are beautiful and the stories are very well written.",2
"if you like rpg first/third person games and most of all free roam than skyrim is a game for you. sure the story isnt as well developed as oblivion was but the number of mods and the detail in side quests makes this game get an a+ in my books sure the graphics arent as good as the crysis series but after all the game was made in 2007. one more thing the game tends to have many bugs",1
"an excellent rpg, showing that you dont need to go mmo to squander hours of your life. bethesda seem to have this knack for creating games that i want to sink hundreds of hours into. if i had to give it a rating, id give it a yes out of yes / no. which i have.",1
"i love this game, never bores me; i can constantly come back to it time after time.",1
"i beat my wife while abusing the immortality glitch and got my one handed skill to 100 10/10 would beat wife again",1
"my eyes are falling out and i am looking at my social life in the rear view mirror. best game ever!!!",1
"epic. the end i played the hell out of this game on console. recently i bought this game on pc to try out some of the mods i have heard so much about........ now i am building a new computer to take full advantage of the mountains of mods available for it. what can be said that has not been said? i personally love the theme of skyrim. cold mountain settings, great voice acting, awsome music, seemingly endless playable content and above all the choice to do what you want how you want when you want mixing play style magic/armour/weapons/races etc its all open this game spoiled me to the point that linear games have to try really hard to hold my attention.... and to top it all off a community of modders providing the tweaks that allow you to make a game build that can facilitate almost any type of playthrough. currently i am really enjoying a skyre/frostfall/r.n.d/deadly dragons style immersive playthrough, and counting the minutes until i can put together a more powerfull pc to enjoy the game in a more hd environment. ok im done..............",1
"dude, this game is sweet! fast and intense action and gameplay, great loading menu, and very long hours of gameplay and a bit challenging of an fps. i would pay $60 for this! thank you bethesda for being one of the greatest video gaming companies and designing great games. i especially look forward to wolfenstein: the new order!",1
"even though i beat this game several times on the ps3, i still had to have it for keeps on the pc. this is by far my favorite part of the series in the elder scrolls collection.",1
"this and dark souls are two rpgs every gamer who likes fantasy should play.",1
"must have!!! this game has alot of gameplay potential in it without counting the extra gameplay you get from the community. the massive open world gives you tons of opportunity to explore with many hidden treasures to uncover. allso has many factions for you to join each with its own storyline.",3
"great game for dropping tons of hours a day playing. i did that the first 1-2 of having the game. there are many skills, quests, and things to do in the game. also this game has a very strong modding community that makes different areas, quests, weapons, etc. i would give it a 9/10.",1
"well i m still playing it ,! i stared the elder scrolls since oblivion but skyrim is sth else!!! got the legendary pack and it is amazing game !!!!!",1
"the best rpg game ever? oblivion can compete easily but theyre the same franchise so i say the es series will never let us down, besides eso... thats .",1
"this game is the reason modders live!!! on its own, straight out of the box - its a good game and worth buying. play it through in its vanilla state to completion, then go get some mods and start again - brand new friggin game!!!! the possibilities for replay are endless, mostly in thanks to the modders, but bethesda has not been shy in handing them the tools, so they deserve some credit too. i seriously cant wait to see what they put out next, but i am just going to keep playing skyrim until they do",4
"it goes straight to the main menu on start up instead of playing a long intro video like other games. also being able to switch between first and third person is nice. you can make your own character and shape them with whatever skills you wish. the only complaint i have is sometimes the npcs get in your way. other than that this game is absolutely amazing.",1
"why dont you have this yet? what is wrong with you?",1
"fantastic game! you could spend your entire life on this game, especially with mods.",1
"i love this game! one of the best, but you wont know unless you give it a try. :)",2
"great gme overall, great side quests that are kind of more interesting than the main story and good looks will make you want to skyrim all day.... fus ro da",1
"hands down, favorite game, hours of fun quests and missions to do, unlimited replayablity, ive put in over 600 hours at the time of this review.",3
"goty 2016 10/11 would trade my gf(she is rewally nice and not fat) for the work of art, i really like the part where this is a total minecraft clone and activision should be sory for even atempting to do such a thing",1
"bought it during the sold always wanted it but had no money to do so, now i have it and its freakin awesome. i mean action everywhere and if you add mods to that it becomes ... subarashii.",1
"this game is a wonderful game for people who like fantasy, rpg, and open world games. the world of skyrim is so large that its hard not wanting to explore it, and its just amazing how many side quests there are and some of the items you get from the side quests, like doing the daedric artifact quests they are really entertaining and hectic side quests. you can also add some thing into your skyrim world with all the mods here on steam and the nexus mod site. theres no end to the greatness of skyrim. so if you cant decide whether or not to buy this, all i am going to say is buy it now!",1
"ive re-played the story over 3 times, and had a completely different experience each go. 10/10.",1
"pretty fun game ive been playing for a long time and i already beat the game so download it ill teach you some tips and tricks",1
"a work of art. sure it has bugs, but still, an amazing game",1
"the game is great but the they have it fixed that you have to go on line through steam to play. since steam is incompatable with my computer i have to download the game through steam every two times i play. at 6 hrs a download this is getting ridiculous. when you buy a game you should not have to go on line to play the game. this is crap. for this reason i do not recommend this game.",3
"a great high fantasy, open world rpg. always a fan of bethesdas games. highly recommend!",1
"a dragon stomped on me, bit my head, and threw me off a mountain. 10/10",2
"the amount of effort put into this game is equivelent to the amount of  that comes out of my ears when i take a dump, a lot.",1
"skyrim cured my diabeetus. i can now live a long healthy life in my studio apartment with my 30 cats eating white chocolate macadamia nut cookies into my golden years. god bless skyrim.",1
"yo homes i punched a dragon to death. 5/4 would praise the based god again",1
"everything is awesome!!!!!!!!!! everything is cool when your solo and not in a team",1
"rating: 9/10 this game has to be in my top 3 for favorites. yet have i experienced a game such as this one. in my opinon, this is a definite step up in the elder scrolls series. i am very pleased with this game, and it is deffinetly possible to tell bethesda has put as much effort into this game as possible. i have yet to finish (i doubt i ever will with all these mods) but is a definite must buy. if you have some spare cash, you must be braindead to not pick up this amazing game. there are little to no cons to this game. however, the fact that the dlc costs more than the game is a bit of a turn-off from purchasing the dlc, but i still heavily reccomend it. this game will be remebered, is a classic for the elder scrolls series, and is a must buy.",1
"you can fight againts ing dragons in epic battles and explore an open world that no matter how much time you spend in the game youll never finish to explore the map. warning: its so addictive",1
"if you havent played this game yet..... what is wrong with you? go get it",2
"its skyrim......if you loved oblivion, morrowind, then you will love skyrim. if you have never played any of the bethesda titles, be prepared for a submersion into a world beyond imagining, with lots of history and a future you are destined to be a part of. enjoy playingthe hero going it alone or with companions. master magic, martial, and other skills which will aid you to explore and fullfill your destiny as the dragonborn. all additional content is great and you can add mods to the main program to further improve or even alter your gaming experience. i highly rommend the dragonborn hideout.... but hey thats me..... anyway hope you enjoy the game :)",2
"game is freaking great, the graphics are very well done, the gameplay and content is beyond belief, and to add on to it, dawnguard and dragonborn expansions are unbelieveable, the story line is just great. well done bethesda, and i tip my hat to all the mod creators on the workshop for this great fantasty medival game. but i give extra 10/10 to valve for creating steam and the community it has. bethesda and valve: beyond 10/10, cant thank you enough for the games you guys create and the experiences we have with them. a steam user- murtagh",1
"this game is old enough by now that everybody should be aware of it. the basics are this, lush open world that engages you into the nordic culture (based off of the norse culture). dragons flying about, enemies galore, some of the best sword combat you can find, decent sneak mechanics, and so much much more. skyrim has a very active modding community and with all the mods available, along with the dlcs, you can change the game entirely. i have spent over 300 hours on this game and still have yet to beat the main mission. thats how much content is in this game! another nice part of this for me at least, is that this is single player. this is a game that you can really just sit back and enjoy, even my non-gaming wife is completely hooked.",2
"after playing this game, i now have chest hair. i would definitely recommend this game if you want to be a manly-man.",1
"great game highly recommend. i have spent hours playing this game first on console then trransfered to pc, one of my personal favourites",1
"if youre looking for a game with long hours of gameplay and immense replay value this is your game.. then again if you are a true gamer you already should know how amazing bethesda and elder scroll games are.",1
"what can be said about skyrim that hasnt already been said? well surely, the replay value goes up with mods. the fact there is a huge list of players who do mods, the replay value never ends.",4
"three things ruined an otherwise amazing game: 1. i could not kill some npcs because they were story-related. they would drop to a knee after damaged, but stand back up. 2. i could not make myself king, instead of backing one of the 2 warring factions. 3. i became ridiculously overpowered and overcapable to the point where i could run past enemies to the objective in almost all areas. one of the best looking, best sounding, and best playing games of the decade. but i could still see the seams, and they ruined it for me.",1
"absolutely amazing game. this game is 30x more enjoyable with a great pair of headphones as it really sets the mood in the game and immerses you in the world. even on my lower-end pc playing this game on medium/low settings, i found the game to be gorgeous. ive barely even scratched the surface of what to complete. my only regret is not getting the legendary edition when it was on sale! guess ill have to wait til next sale.",1
"wonderful immersive game. played it to death on the xbox360 but loving the graphics and mods on the pc.",2
"tell you what, i love skyrim! i have owned this game on ps3, xbox 360 and now on pc and it just never gets old. if youre looking for hours upon hours of exciting gameplay then this is definitely the game for you...",1
"the best occidental rpg so far, incredibly gorgeous and rich.",1
"killed my innocent companion, sold their clothes and inherited 300 gold 10/10: would kill in cold blood again",1
"this game is amazing! if you like the elder scrolls series this is the games for you. i recommend to get this game with all the expantion packs, becauses then you can build a house, ride dragons, and eat people as a vampire. my favorite thing in the game to do right now is to ride dragons and make it attack other dragons in the air.",1
"this is one of the best games ever and i have played alot of games so i recomend this to everyone but be perpared with a good graphics card",1
"the elder scrolls is like a holiday... you have to wait a couple of years, but when another comes out, you can celebrate it any time you want.",1
"awesome game. gives loads of gameplay and an open world where you can wander for days. good game if you have nothing to do.",2
"real gamers dont complain they dont have enough money for their favorite games. they starve themselves for the chance to play.",1
"the singleplayer game i have spent the most time on. this is the best rpg ive played yet.",1
"this is one the best games to come out on pc. ever. it is so well done in almost every single way from the amazing story to the seamless combat. however, it becomes more than worth your money when you add some of the countless mods that you can find here on steam or at the skyrim nexus. with mods you can change every single aspect of the game and make it look drop dead gorgeous while doing it. you dont even need that good of a pc to run this game. i have about 80+ mods and my gtx 680 handles it perfectly. any complant that i did have can be fixed with mods so i wont even list those on here. if you dont already have it than you have to it is a pc must have. 10/10 would bang",1
"if i have 107 hours on record and ive only been able to use 800x600 resolutions and kept all the other settings on the lowest possible level, the game has to be pretty good. 5/5 ebin",1
"this game has everything that the hype said it would beautiful graphics, compelling story, cool ways to kill people, and interesting human dynamics to observe. i love this game, and am excited each and every time i get to play it.",1
"i have aiways been excited to play skyrim.ever since i player skyrim, i have been playing it every day, i changed my name to dragonborn, i changed my picture to the dragonborn, and i played about 500 hours of skyrim.i highly recommend it to everyone. you cant go wrong with buying skyrim. it is worth every penny of its purchase.",3
"probably one of my favorite games in the last few years. ive played through on at least 15 different characters and each time i find things that i never did on my previous playthroughs. plus with the modding community there are several quality addons that are easily comparable to the official dlc. to any rpg fan this is a must purchase imo.",2
"what more needs to be said about this game? if you havent experienced skyrim, you need to immediately.",1
"a true master piece of a game 101+ hours of playing time is the proof for this. also with mods skyrim can becomes a completely new game in short if you dont mod the game you are playing it wrong.",1
"such a great rpg game. the graphics are wonderful, the whole story line is beautiful. 10/10",2
"no words can describe this game. a picture is worth 1,000 words, and no picture/screenshot can describe this game. a 60 frames-per-second (fps) video shows 60 pictures/frames every second, and no video (no matter the length) can describe this game. i say this because there are no words to write in a review about how astonishingly, stunningly, jaw-dropping, breathtakingly beautiful this game is, but i hope that i at least made my point clear. (by the way, acording to the review up above, a 20 minute video would be 72,000,000 words, for those who were wondering.)",1
"still one of the best rpgs out there. complain about how simplistic it is all you want, its got great feeling combat and literally hundreds of quests. the quests are technically infinite, just repeated with certain values changed. a huge map with a few greats dlcs and it goes for cheap now - buy it.",1
"i love skyrim. there is so much to do, and it is funn to mod. you cant beat the current price. i is def worth the buy!",2
"i wasnt sure about the whole first person rpg thing initially. but this game is awesome. you can play any style of character you want, go whereever you want (almost), etc. i highly recommend this game.",1
"is in my humble opinion the best open world game to this date. while the main story might not be too exciting, the world, its environment, the sounds, graphics and the granted mod support for skyrim make real life almost obsolete.",1
"you cant marry the vampire lady. also, it crashes a lot. 2/10",2
"best elder scrolls even better that elder scrolls online and this is the best part is........ mod the ing game like 1 mod is gonna give u a billion dollors then play it omg u will be stuck on it for years o_o",2
"if you like open world games or rpgs and you dont get skryim.. your freaking crazy!",1
"this is my one my favorite games. with modding you play forver. woul highly recommend",4
"truly one of the greatest games that ever was or will be, skyrim is something that has to be experienced rather than discussed to get why this game rocks. the fact that this game is still being updated with mods and that players are literally spending thousands of hours on this game speaks for itself. that being said, the game has its flaws (the dragons become just so repetitive, for one) but this is more than made up by its gargantuan scale, allowing players to do almost anything. skyrim offers an escape that few other games can provide and it only makes me hungry for the next elder scrolls installment.",1
"great game. jimmy neutron says so..... you have to get it now.",1
"apparently i just wasted $60 because i wasnt aware of the myriad mouse problems that bethesda hasnt bothered to fix in over three years. also found out that steam doesnt do refunds. youre welcome for my money bethesda. youll never get another dime from me. they never should have released this game in this broken state, especially with a lazy, money-grabbing developer that refuses to fix the real problems.",1
"at first time i played skyrim, i was 12, and had purchased a ps3 for solely playing skyrim (i heard much from my best friend) absolutely fell in love with it, logged in thousands of hours over these 2 years (ps3 + pc) never got old, never got bored. played hour after hour after hour..",2
"such a fun and addicting game i cant wait until the online elder scroll game comes out",1
"i like this game, because its an epic world with lots of items and quests. tho i have discovered a bug with shadowmere, the dark brotherhood horse.. i was forced to delete my best character, which of course made me a little sad...",2
"this is one of my favorite games ever made, and theres just a metric ton of quality content out there for this release. for your story driven, rpg you cant go wrong wth this one.",1
"this game will blow your mind with a big fus ro dah.",5
"i havent played that much on pc but xbox 360tm is a whole other story. ive enjoyed this game from 2012 to the year 2014. just a beyond common adventure game.",1
"i used to be the hero of skyrim, but then i accidentally killed a chicken... keep calm and fus ro dah",2
"this is hands down, one the best games i have ever played in my life. the graphics are amazing, the combat is fun, and the lore runs really deep. it was really easy to become completely sucked into skyrim. skyrim has tons of stuff to do, and with the workshop and the nexus it doesnt stop.",2
"chopped a butterfly in half with a katana then was  by mudcrabs. 69/10 would waste life again",1
"picked this game up during the winter sale on a whim. never played the earlier games in the series. the first thing i noticed about this game is the graphics and immersion you feel in this game. its a beautiful game. the attention to detail, the breathtaking views, the epic battles; you can tell bethesda put everything they had into this game. as for gameplay, it can be slow at times as its very open ended. do whatever you want is basically the purpose in this game. i imagine the replayability of this game is very high making it a good value. exploring the world in this game can be fun in itself and if you dont like being restricted by storylines or shooters on rails style games, youll love this game. im not a huge fan of rpg games but even i find this game to be an experience to play. on sale its well worth taking a chance on trying it out.",1
"i love this game so much i own it 3 times, 360,ps3, and now pc",1
"saw a dragon swan dive right into the ground with complete disregard for its own, and others safety. 10/10",1
"this game is awsome to play. no story line you must follow, but plenty to go around. you can play this game in any way that you want. if you want to wander and kill wolfs you can, if you want to play one of the story lines in the game you can. the choises you make can make it so you wont be able to do other things, making this game one youll play for many hrs. i would buy dlcs to. both dawnguard and dragonborn have their own story line, dragonborn even adds to the map and gives you more to wander by and explore. so if you like fantasy and this free style gaming, where many mods and fan made quests can be freely downloaded via the steam workshop, this is you; re buy.",1
"this game is pretty skyrim if you know what i mean- ign 2014",1
"excellent game to chill with and a nice break from multiplayer gaming.of all the games ive played like wow or shooters, for a single player game this is a true masterpiece, from the story line, the nordic style and accents of the characters to the soundtrack this must have been a project the developers will never forget. ill remember this like i remember the old colossal cave adventure in the old days.",2
"never played an elder scrolls game before, more from the baldurs gate franchise side. must admit didnt know if this was up my ally as i usually like having parties to control. picked the game up on the xmas specials and after 7 hours can honestly say am really enjoying. one of the best games i have played in years.",1
"fus-ro-da get it? that means its a good game. go buy it. or ill send alduin to make sure you buy it.",1
"it was a very good game but it had 2 faults that stood out. 1: the game towards the end became far too easy even on very hard. 2: the endings for the war were very anticlimactic it didnt matter much what you chose and they never expanded to do a dlc with the aldmeri dominion. (which kinda pisses me off) both of these can somewhat be solved by mods",1
"love this game. absolutely a fantastic game, and allows so much freedom. recommend skyrim to all!!!!!",1
"400 some hours put into it. yeah its is a good game",2
"the best video game i have ever played. it is just so much more than an epic, fantasy, rpg; it is an expierence. it is incredible, just buy it now.",2
"this game is insane, if you want to waste away days of your life, buy skyrim. the immense volume of content featured, like with every elder scrolls game is, well, immense. between my hours played on the ps3 and pc is some ridiculous amount. and the sheer amount of mods you can add to the game is great. probably one of my favorite games on the record.",1
"if you like roleplaying in games, and like to use a ton of time just looking around this is the game for you. if u manage to complete the game 20 times like myself, then you can head over to nexusmods and then make the game so that you cant even see that its skyrim anymore. enjoy",2
"well after a virginity-solidifying 550+ hours of skyrim i can safely say that my chances of ever reproducing have hit the negatives. mod the game, by the way.",3
"its like a buffet dinner; sure, theres mountains of food to eat, but everything just has the same bland processed food taste albeit with a nordic tinge. -michael raston even with any number of dlcs/mods you may wish to impose upon the game. trust me ive tried.",2
"the best elder scrolls game yet with a world that feels more detailed and well realised than any other game in the series before it. the writing feels more solid and less generic and the quality and variety of the voice acting is much improved. the dungeons feel a lot more individual than in previous titles as well. this is a massive world brimming with content. hundereds of hours gameplay in the standard game alone, and thats not including the dlc. edit: im revisiting this review as its been a few years now and it is still on my hard drive and with the support of the community it is looking more beautiful that ever. i know friends who have spent hundreds of hours on this game, myself included. skyrim is a landmark game and if you have somehow managed to miss it, hang your head in shame for a while, the get your  into gear and go buy it. no, dont look at me like that, thats a  order.",1
"whats there to say, you can do anything, be anything. this is my game of the year. action, story, betrayal, dragons, marriage, own homes, work...there is so much going on in this game youll never let it go!!",1
"this is a great game! probably one of the best ive ever played! yolo",1
"who can go wrong with skyrim? nothing best game hands down.",1
"latest game in the elder scrolls series (prior to elder scrolls online), many elements of the game have been dumbed down and/or streamlined for more casual gamers to get into it. if you ignore all the great things from previous games though this game stands on its own merits as a fun romp through a sandbox world. the singlular reason to buy this game on steam rather than on the console is the capablity to be modded. check the steam workshop and the nexusmods for details on that. you are in control - you can change the difficutly at any time, you can install whatever mods you want to make the game more enjoyable. anything you want you can do. if you want to challange yourself, legendary difficutly + difficutly enhancing mods exist. if you want it easy, then novice difficutly lets you hack and slash your way through the story and of course there are all shades in between. swords, maces, bows/crossbows, shields, dual wielding, magic, and more. play the way you want thats the name of the game. your experience is what you make of it, imagine you are in a story and play that way!",5
"ive played alot of games and i always seem to get board of them after awhile but skyrim is one that i can play and play and it will never get boring.",1
"i think we can all agree to say that the only flaw in skyrim is immortal children.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of my most favorite games of all time. the game allows you to do anything you want to do in a free-roaming non-linear sandbox world. yet at the same time, you never feel as though you lack purpose or direction, as immersive quests keep you playing to find out what will happen next. your choices also matter and effect the outcome quite a bit as well, which is something most gamers value. there is an extensive fan base and modding community as well that has contributed even more than the vanilla game. while the original vanilla is near perfect, high quality mods tailored to the players every wish and playstyle are sure to keep you entertained even more.",3
"the best but glitchiest game you will ever play. one time i was venturing down a path and i heard a bark and i didnt know where it was coming from but then a dog sat up and it emerged from a rock. it was clipping into the rock. what the  was it doing in that  rock.",1
"this game is great in itself, but the real magic here is in the mods. buy this game just for the mods. graphic enhancements, immersive mods, gameplay-improving mods, and turning dragons into thomas the train is what this game is all about. the vanilla skyrim is great too. besides the wonky combat. mods can fix that.",1
"elder scrolls, as with any other bethesda title, the mods are what make this great.",1
"whats to say its awsome:) but not for those who dont like to kill or see blood.",2
"arena was better because when i was a kid there were only 150 pokemon. charizard is best, these dragons suck. dont buy this game, its not red and blue",2
"how to make millions in 15 easy steps: 1) dumb down a pretty good established franchise 2) ruin said franchise 3) obtain a fanbase convinced your game is the second coming of christ 4) make people think you started with the fifth game (im not kidding) 5) make a horrendously clunky combat system 6) make a generic fantasy world to go with the clunky combat system (seriously, morrowind was more interesting than plains and mountains) 7) false advertise by saying you made a new engine just for this game when it is clearly a slightly modified version of the one youve been using since 2002 8) eliminate classes and multiple skills (because its still an rpg, right?) 9) microsoft exclusivity deal good for 2 dlcs 10) make a first, incredibly overpriced dlc 11) make a second dlc that is a repackaged mod made without giving any credit to the author 12) extend the microsoft exclusivity deal 13) release another dlc slightly more worth it 14) ??? 15) profit",1
"this game is an fantastic example on rpgs. this game raised the bar for rpgs, absolutely amazing",1
"a really, really, really... no. epic is the right word for this game, walking around kill beast of all shapes n sizes. cant get enough of this game, the world would be a whole another place without this game! [#recommend] 18.4/20.0",1
"best rpg game of this generation, setting the standards for every rpg game made.",1
"i showed up in the first town and killed a chicken, then got caught in an infinite loop of respawning and instantly being killed. once i learned not to kill chickens or basically attack anyone who matters, i had a much easier time of it.",1
"so this game is amazing. lets not lie if youre looking at a review for this game, you lack common sense.",1
"if you want to put youself into a world that fantasy and dragon slaying never stops,thats the perfect game for you.amazing graphics and atmosphere,extremely huge map,thousends of quests and a story that sticks uniquely with the previous elder scrolls.i believe its one of the best titles out there that every gamer must have.if you like fantasy and creatures than this game is for you!",1
"every person should play this all the time. so damn good.",1
"still cant decide between the imperial legion and the stormcloaks! >< 10/10",1
"by far the best game of the series. beautiful landscape, character design, and item variations. the story was top notch and once again i could not believe how beautiful skyrim was. i put 300+ hours into the xbox 360 version. i was recently gifted the elder scrolls anthology so i am now going to slowly play through skyrim again. excellent game!",1
"this is one of the best rpgs ever made, not much more i can say beyond that. can wait for number 6 to come out.",1
"amazing game, great storyline, great free roam feel. although the new elder scrolls you made was a mistake. make a game like skyrim then your buisness should sky rocket again.",1
"boring as heck. huge world and lots of walking around with fetch quests. combat is so simplistic, hold the triggers and thats it. same boring monsters. dungeons with 2-3 mobs and thats it. what a snooze fest. cant believe how overrated this game is. these open ended games are getting too massive for their own good. spent more time getting to destination than playing the game. thumbs down. dragon age a ton better.",1
"[9/10] this game is beautimous. excepting a few annoyances and glitches, its amazing and great fun.",1
"a must have title for your steam library. 100+ hrs game time into this title and still nowhere near finished. recommend this game to anyone.",1
"this game is only bested by the third installment in the series: morrowind. i love both games but the magical possibilities of morrowind makes it better to me... being able to levitate for instance is something that skyrim lacks in comparison to its older brother! with more than 200 hours played, id say that this is one of my favorite games of all time in the first person rpg category!",1
"do you like going outside? then youll hate this game 10/10",1
"boring. dead. shallow. cardboard-cutout npcs. once you spend real time with the game, you come to realize you are stuck in a world where nothing happens without you, while your own adventures grow increasingly familiar, repetitive, and stale. i actually grew too bored with the game to finish the main quest. were it not for the modding community, this latest entry in the elder scrolls franchise would have died a quiet, boring death long ago. bethesda has grown to become just another tone-deaf publisher without a sense of adventure, novelty, or wonder.",1
"the dragons are coming back to skyrim and you are the only one that can stop them, you are dragonborn. though the dragons arent the biggest concern because skyrim is in the middle of civil war the high king has been murdered you must choose a side, will you support ulfrick stormcloack and his rebel army or will you join (the far superior) imperial army. there are a lot of other side- and main quests in the game as wel. bethesda has nailed it again by producing a game that in my opinion is the king of rpgs. 9/10",1
"man is it atmospheric! keep your eye on the clock, because the hours will slip away. my only qualms in an otherwise incredible game: - can get repetitive as most interiors are generally the same just rearranged - little variation in voice dialogue. - the difficulty settings handicap the player rather than make the ai more skillful or strategic. would have loved: - greater ability to change the story/gameplay based on the decisions you make/dont make. icing on the cake: - the score. its become one of my all time favourite sountracks. 8/10",1
"this really is a great game. one of the first good open-world games. i would suggest it to anyone who has not played it!",1
"the elder scolls v skyrim is one of the most immersive games i have ever played to date. due to the multiple things you can do in this game you will clock in adleast 40+ hours alone on one character and that is without saying a game that is worth my money.",1
"warning : games awesomeness and mods will make you play for hours and hours",1
"this game is amazing! tons of quests that you accedentally run into, and when you have mods it makes it even better.",1
"i first got this on my xbox and did great.now with the computer i have a ton more ways to play because there are mods.i recomend this game to everybody who like adventure and single player game.explore battle be whatever.hope you like it as much as me(from 1 o 10 mine would be ....over 9000) buy and play. :)",1
"been playing for more than 200 hours on another account, this game is amazing! 9.5/10",1
"this is the greatest fantasy openworld i played as of now! the mods alone can immerse you even if you havent touched 5% of the vanilla game.",1
"gorgeous and extensive 1st/3rd person sandbox rpg. on the downside it doesnt really have memorable characters. it also feels a bit empty. they tell me theres this terrible civil war raging but i havent seen any imperial vs. stormcloaks battles. nevertheless skyrim offers a lot of bang for buck.",1
"i prefer fallout 3 and fallout new vegs. skyrims landscapes and dynamic weather are stunning but fallout 3 and fallout new veagas has the better gameplay/combat and more charming and quirky characters.",1
"story isnt really that long to me but there are tons of side quests i give it a thumbs up :p",1
"amazing game, both as a singular game and as a continuation of the eder scrolls series.",2
"if you honestly dont own skyrim yet and claim to own a gaming pc i have a set of instuctions for you step 1 - unplug computer step 2 - throw it out step 3 - re-evaluate your life choices this is the crme de la crme of rpgs. it is the rpg godsend. i swear this is the only game you will ever need. it is that special type of amazing you can not type. 10/10",1

"nice experience of killing dragons and tons of  to do in the game ! 10/10",1
"if you like shouting at people, you need this. also beats oblivion 100-0",1
"enourmous game to explore. an recomendation for anyone that is willing to spend dozens of hours to complete as many quests as possible!",2
"what hasnt been said about this game? its like the ffvii of american rpgs. normally im not a fan of these games. didnt have fun w/ tes3 or 4, but i love the setting in skyrim.",1
"absolutely a wondeful game, the world is huge, and the customizations you can make to play styles and the character alone are enormous. even if you dont love the game like i do (or even dislike it) you will not be able to put it down.",2
"skyrim is easily the most fun game ive played since oblivion. being delpoyed was tough but i could escape to skyrim for a while and it made things a lot easier.",2
"ive played on playstation and computer, probaly 200+ hours of playtime, and i can still find new things, which i love!",1
"one of the greatest games ive ever played in my life. 10/10",1
"its a big world with many things to do. it also has the quick save so if you you want to kill everyone quick save then kill every one and then load your quick save, it also helps for pickpocketing.",1
"i have been playing this for 6 months now and still can not believe how vast this game is. its by far the most fun i have had on any computer game...not bored yet!",2
"so addictive by the time since ive owned it my play time has clocked in at 200+ hours.",2
"im pretty new to the gamer world so you can take my opinion pretty lightly, but i really love this game! it was the first real rpg i ever played and now i am hooked! i love the open world feel and the graphics are great. i really feel sucked into my character and into skyrim.",1
"terrible game 0/10 first there are thousands of hours of gameplay. second the modding community adds infinte hours of gameplay. very interesting story lines and missions. do not get this game it will ruin your life.",1
"i recently switched from playing on xbox360 to pc. its like the game is brand new, now. i recommend this game to anyone who hasnt played it. if you havent played it, what have you been doing? nothing as good as playing skyrim, i can assure you. youll easily play for days and days without getting bored. once you do get bored, just start a new game and do everything totally differently. not only is it one of the most replayable games of all time, its so beautiful, you will at times find yourself just staring at things and forget what you were even doing. its a must play game.",1
"well, skyrim... what can i say. more content and more possibilities to enjoy a huge game are hard to be found. the battle systems not something that got too much love back from gamers, but the games definitely worth a playthrough or two.",1
"skyrim is one of the best games ive played, ive been a fan of the elder scrolls since morrowind and every game they bring out seems to be more bigger than the other, iam always blown away.",1
"one of my top top 5 favorite games, if you havent played skyrim your missing out on such a great rpg. i would definitley recommend this to anyone! :d 10 out of 10 with so much open world to explore the game is almost endless (besides the main campaign of course). :d",1
"extremely awesome game!!!! xd all my friends definitely better get this game or youre not my friend! lol jk graphics visuals are incredible! and you dont even need a super high-end pc to play it on. ive seen someone play it on 3-4 year-old hardware. game can work on dx9, dx10, or dx11 rigs. played for over 100 hours and not even near done yet. im waiting to continue where i am with the major storyline unitl after im as high i can go with all the major guilds/faction first. there are so many different ways to play, is so much to do & the game has so many places to explore. im just awe-struck everytime i enter the world of skyrim. the elder scrolls series gets better & better with each new game release - and ive been with the series since the elder scrolls ii: daggerfall (around 1997-98). tes v: skyrim = phenominal!!!!!!!!!!! get it!!! ;)",3
"best rpg ever, simply amazing how the game makes you feel immersed and if you dont like something you can just download a mod for it on the workshop!",2
"this game is amazing 88its an absolute must have for elderscrolls fans personally i have over 100 hours o game time and hvae enjoyed every sekond of it (thats whithout dlcs) im looking forward to purchasing the dlcs and expanding my game features arsenal if anyone who reads this and has a few spare bucks might whant to consider buying this game also if you like messing about with mods youre in luck there are over 7 million mods outthere to play with this game is one of my all time favorets 10/10",1
"this is by far one of the best games ive ever played",1
"one of the best games ive played in my intire life :)",1
"havent really done more than tried it out, but it seems alright so far....",5
"this game is the best 100/10 mod it til it crashes i have so many mods definatly worth it you can do anything it came out 3 years ago but the mods keep it going i played 100h and i regret nothing it is amazing",1
"i love this game. its simple beauty lies in the amount of control the player has over how they play. skyrim is a different game for each person, whether you like to play as a mage, a warrior, or a thief. with seemingly never-ending quests and objectives, youll never grow bored of this game, because even if you cant find anything more to do, creating a new character creates an entirely new game and a new series of adventures. trust me when i say its really hard to get tired of this game. to top it off, the graphics are amazing, and bethesdas new engine is gentle even to some underpowered systems. i cant recommend this game enough.",1
"this game is getting old now but its still fun to play",2
"skyrim is absolutely unparalleled in scope and ambition. yes, sometimes that leads to oddities and imperfections, but this is a world in which to -lose- yourself for hours and hours and hours...",1
"bloody awsome game!kept me busy for 356 hours and counting!",3
"this game is big and interesting. worth what you pay",1
"simply the best game ever. sure, it has some bugs and glitches, but the world of skyrim is so big, full of things to do and to discover, a great athmosphere that sucks you into the world, hundreds of mods... 100 % worth to buy and try! i just love this game!",1
"i never came out of my room. my soul went into the game.",1
"nyan cat loves the elder scrolls skyrim it is an epic legendery awesome 666/666 10/10 buy it or i am gone kill you in game! ok?",2
"played and finished this game on ps3 when it came out, but got it on here cause i had heard good things of the mod community, overall amazing game in vanilla form, but you can re-build the game from the ground up with mods, everything from completely re-doing the graphics into stunning hd 4k textures, to having auto-tuned bears and  arrows, great game, made even better through the moding community :)",1
"lets me live out my twilight fantasies, team edward all the way!",1
"the amount of content in this game is astonishing. the world is huge and freedom to travel anywhere makes it a really amazing experiance. there are a lot of quests to do that can last hundreds hours of fun to finish. the legendary edition is really worth its price. the dragonborn add-on introducing the solstheim island is especailly recommended. i havent even started using mods yet (aside from unoffical patch) and i read that using a nice set of mods can further enchance this already great game. best game i played in a very long time.",1
"i love this, are only two good rpg like this skyrim and witcher. grafics is amazing, playeble is beutiful, soundtrack is realy nice.",1
"half the fun of the game is the mods lol if you ever get bored just go to the workshop and enjoy.",1
"i just have three litlle words about this game  buy this game thats really all i have to say about the game",1
"beautiful. absolutely beautiful and endlessly modable",1
"one of the greatest games ive ever played. i didnt really think id like it, cause i had seen my father playing fallout 3 and the talking looked boring, but i could not have been more wrong. unfortunately the game can get quite fustrating with the countless amount of glitches in the game. i suggest getting the steam version because you can easily fix most of them by using console comands. mods are also cool because they introduce a new look on how you play the game. for example, you could install new armor if youre bored with all the other ones or download new missions in case the endless missions arnt enough for you. and the best part of that is that steam workshop makes installing mods incredibly easy. in conclusion i would give this game an 8/10 just because the glitches in the game can be very frustrating at times",1
"you buy this game, and you will suddenly find yourself with no time left for real life.",2
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"will drain your life and soul while smiling at you.",1
"great game with epic experiences in a seamless world!",1
"killed a dragon, ate his soul, married a lizard man, became a cannibal, ate nazeem, ate my husband, joined the imperial army, ate ulfric stormcloak, 10/10",2
"the elder scrolls: skyrim is a huge and immersive rpg one of the best one i have ever play 10/10",1
"amazing game! i recommend this game to anyone who likes magic, dragons and medievil stuff!",1
"im honestly surprised i have time to even write a review for this... now, ifn youll excuse me there are dragons to slay and draugr to make more-deader... review scores --- 99% gfx (get some mods!) 99% sound / atmosphere 99% gameplay that adds up to 297% which isnt bad out of 100 ...",2
"its a bit late to say that, but this is definitely one of my favorite games ever.",1
"its freakin skyrim m8. you wrekt witout it. get it",1
"this is one of my favorite games i have ever played. i have spent many hours on it on xbox and pc. i have done three playthroughs and completed the main story line and more on each of them as there are multiple paths you can take (e.g warrior, mage, assassin) giving you the replayability of completing the game as a different path each time.",1
"a fantastic rpg with a wide open world and a ridiculous amount of gameplay. 10/10",1
"cant believe it has been 3 years since this game came out. still addictive as f**k , huge modding community makes it a lot better and optimization is really good. infinite possibilities.",1
"not sure why it took so long to purchase and play skyrim. ive only logged about 10 hours but i am thoroughly hooked. definitely worth every penny as a solid sandbox style game that has hours upon hours of playtime to be had.",1
"accidentally stole a wooden bowl and sparked a massive battle. wololod guards to my side, starting a civil war. im the sole survivor of the bowlttle of whiterun 2014. 10/10.",3
"this game is great the gameplay is so enjoyible and the story is good. the side missions are very fun. the audio and vocie acting is great. the textures are a bit blocky but you cant really notice. i recommend this game. 9.5/10",1
"ohhhhhhhhhhhs hh shhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit how the  do i even fuuuucckkkaskd sdafsdfsda grse grehgtewh",1
"epic fun, hours and hours of exploration and you still find new things",1
"just bought this game on sale for $4.99 gotta say it pays to have steam!",1
"love this game, it has a big open world map and have many places to explore. it dont have multiplayer, but mod of this game is very much and interesting",1
"i just turned all of the dragons into thomas the tank engine characters and killed them all in iron man armor. why the  would you not want this game?",1
"a great fantasy rpg by the great company bethesda. really enjoyable to play. (insert arrow in the knee filler joke here)",1
"shout at dragons. play without mods for a fantastic casual rpg, with a large open world and many things to do. tes: v/10 play with mods for the best possible gaming experience you can currently achieve on a pc. /10 there are no limits to how much you can modify the game. the only restrictions are your own technical skill levels, and hardware performance. anything you want to do, you can do. most mods youd want already exist somewhere but if for some reason one doesnt then you can easily make it yourself. the creation kit is easy to use and writing custom scripts (to use with a script extender) is not much harder. really this game is only as good as it is because of its modability and modding community. without the mods i wouldnt even recommend this game to anyone.",1
"played the game for 2 hours took a break came back to play save file is gone.. uuuuuggggghhhhhhhhhhhh.... i dont even know what to rate this. i mean, its an awesome game, but on the other hand, i probably will just let it ferment in my games library and go play garrys mod or something until i decide to regain the patience to play again.",1
"i must say only this, best rpg game up to date. the freedom and the story in here is simply amazing. did i mention the that the graphics is marvelous to?",1
"this game is too fun but i need more i completed it in less than a summer i completed dawnguard in three days gimme more",2
"loved this game so much that i often fell asleep during the summer because i played it so often. beautiful graphics and stunning world-building, however there is the danger that you will forget your main quest or will pass out and wake up 3 hours later, with keyboard face, to the sound of a very angry dragon. honestly it could use some work to make you care, to make you want to do the main quest. there is no concequence for waiting a month to solve an urgent matter.",1
"a seriously over-rated game. the visuals are stunning yeah, but they navigation and camera controls are clunky and horrible. the quest system is not bad but ultimately not as smooth as other solid rpgs. skyrim is too much a look what we can do game. its about the visuals and the tech than good storytelling or gameplay.",1
"the best rpg you can get wiith a great lore and immersivenes (if that is even a word)",1
"i havent even started the game yet because the title screen music is so glorious.",1
"i first bought skyrim on the 360 and played it on and off for 2 years and still havent compleated it ! it is a cool game however i would warn against using the console to make yourself uber hard as it may detract from your gaming pleasure if you can kill everything with one hit. but if you buy this game you should deffinatley look at the steam workshop because people have made some cool and interesting mods and if you are brave enough you may want to have a go at making some yourself.",1
"do you need a recommendation? really? buy it you .",1
"bethesda has done it again with another success, graphics, gameplay, leveling up, dragons, a nerds best dream but also a gamers dream, they got everything that was good with fallout and oblivion and ll the other games and crammed them together without stuffing it up at all as there is a good balance between weapons you dont really find level 1 swords when your a level 60 which i love and the dagon shouts just add a new strategy in combat with fusrodah or the blink ability from dishonoured just for you to use in that tricky dungeon the puzzles are a bit of a challenge but not much and the pc version just does it right, mods, graphics, loading times, everything. im rating it 10/10",1
"a old game,but the modding comunity and the graphics make it feel new i played through it a few times, and it will always be my 2nd favorite game, why? its burned in my heart 10/10",1
"skyrim is the best pc game i have played in a long time!",1
"in my opinion, i believe skyrim to be the best elder scrolls game bethesda has made. it has the best ever graphics ive seen. its the neverending game, due to the workshop and the tortureable kids.",2
"short review: 50 hours and more of pure fun. if you enjoyed oblivion or witcher series, you should definitely try this one. good points: * good enough main story and insteresting subquests * aswesome graphics and landscapes * skill trees and combat * huge world * best elder scroll so far. * open worldness (you feel quite free) bad points * can easily become too easy if you abuse the game (unbalanced) * can lose interest if leave the main story. * repetition. (ex: killing the first dragon is cool but afterward it becomes too easy and boring chasing them)",1
"best game ever- make sure you have atleast a gtx 660 2gb gddr5to get its full potential good gameplay and really addictive when you get into the quests",1
"its good. you can hunt bears. who doesnt like to hunt bears? however, the only down side is that you cannot inflict damage to children. i know.. howd that make it through testing?",1
"this is probably one of the most immersive and beautifully detailed game worlds ive ever played in. its an rpg where you can play it however you desire and there is an endless amount of content that will be keep you engaged for weeks. its definatly worth a buy.",1
"at first you are like this games fun, then you are like woah there are mods and then you dont stop the mods and then the next thing you know you are playing as a giant with a strap-on fighting thomas the tank engine",2
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim one of the best steam games ive ever played. 10 - 10",1
"10/10 would stick my khajiit  in again. highly recommend the immersive sweetroll mod which will add incredible immersion into the already immersive elderscrolls game.",1
"loved skyrim, to this day i still find this to be one of the best games ever made. the game does an amazing job of making the world feel alive. there is a problem with enemy and friendly ais, but these were easily fixed with mods. speaking of mods, i think we should consider the amount of work people have put into making the wonderfully crafted content for this game. it speaks volumes of the love put into this game by the player community, and the foresight by bethesda to make the game so easy to manipulate. this game is proof that some developers still care about the players and not just the money from sales.",1
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"get the dragon out of this game... put a macho man ign 10/10",1
"its a very fun interesting game with amazing graphics perfect for killing and chopping peoples heads off",1
"omg.. only game stoped me frm playing csgo for more than 2 days",1
"dont expect a completely bug free expiernce.but at this moment its one of the best fantasy rpg`s out there.",1
"i dont get it. you walk around talk to people, kill some dragons, learn to scream because you are apparently a mute.",1
"great visuals and mechanics but can get a bit repetitive.",1
"well were do i begin the elder scrolls v skyrim is one of the greatest gamse i ahev ever played and will keep playing it never gets dull and i think the game is just the best",2
"this game is one of the best game in the history of gaming. incredible story line, great graphics & to be honest... great everything! i really really recommend playing this game, its worth the time and certainly worth the money! 10/10",1
"if you want to say: hey, i just finished skyrim then dont play this game. you dont finish skyrim because it is a world, not a game. almost all of the secondary quests are amazing, some of them are also as good as the main quest. you can have a lot of different playstiles like half mage half warrior, marksman assassin... also, the number of mods that there is in nexus adds a lot more variety to the world. i just love this game, sometimes i enter skyrim just to go to falkreath mounted on arvak and sleep at the dead mans drink at night and then i just go kill some dragons and clear a big dungeon. i love this game, 100% recommended ah...the life of a hero.",2
"this game is........great...no no not great. amazing! it gives you so much to do! if its slashing things all day or smithing armour you can do it. it gives so much oppourtunity. so many dungeons, dragons, trolls, foxes, and etc. you wotn be disapponted. i like to just screw around with the guards then go on a massacure. yes, sounds crazy, well its because i am crazy!",1
"feels repititive and not as fascinating as its predecessor oblivion. but bethesda rarely produces bad games, so still not bad really.",1
"probably the worst 2 hours of my life. ever. 2/10 for interesting story. but thats it.",1
"when taken in total, it must be admitted that the elder scrolls v: skyrim does not deviate much from the established elder scrolls formula. however, the painstakingly-designed world in combination with the retooled leveling system represents the most polished version of that formula to date. theres something to be said for sticking with what one knows and refining it, and in skyrims case, theres a lot to be said for it. - gamecritics not much of a skyrim fan, but played some time on this game with mods which makes everything better 91/100",1
"takes adventuring to a whole new level! with these stunning graphics you will feel as if you have stepped back in time or in a whole new world!",1
"definition of skyrim: amazing! beutiful! and simply a need! if you dont like skyrim then you are not a gamer ^^",1
"i strongly recommend this game with its price it has good value if your not choosing to buy it i will say this #syyyyyyyyyyyyyynd",1
"some people find this game tiring because its endless. thats precisely why its the best one ive ever played. there are main quests, side-quests, an immense world to explore, you are free to do as you please, your actions or choices can have certain consequences, the expansions and mods just make the experience even more unforgettable, your character can become whoever you want it to be, no matter whether its a peerless assassin, a mighty warrior or the most powerful sage. or all of these. i love being able to decide which skills i want to train. as for the stories in the quests, i find them amazing and very interesting, and they just make me want more of skyrim, especially the smaller quests. details make the difference. the graphics are just beautiful, and the game itself is full of life (can be increased with mods, although these are not essential). if run on a desktop pc, the game can be enjoyed at its full capacity, but it can also run pretty smoothly on a good laptop. id definitely recommend it to people who look for the perfect equilibrium between adventure and exploring (action-visual enjoyment), and to make their own path without the game building it for them.",1
"i love this game! making stuff, like you do in minecraft, but amazing scenery & lots of quests.",4
"if youre a older elder scrolls fan this game may upset you a bit,to see it be watered down and some of the best parts of the older games removed but that aside its till a amazing game,it has alot of content to play around with. i highly reccomend mods for this game,it adds that little bit of spice to this game and really buffs it up a notch,this game has endless replayabiltiy and it adds even more replayability with mods.",1
"skyrim is defenitely one of the best games ive ever played. the story, the awesome and big as hell open world, the way your actions have consequences, the almost infinite quests and all the awesome armor and weapons and other cool stuff you can find in this world is what makes this games almost perfect!",1
"if you dont play this game, ill find you and rip you throat out... masterpiece.",1
"you should buy this because of all the crazy and weird modz you can install and plus to test the extent of how powerful you computer id and it still looks good even on low setting and it runs smoothly",1
"this game will give you a break from the first person shooters. this game is a fisrt person melee weapon combat (and bows) its almost as if your playing one person in a mmo!",5
"totally recomended. skyrim is a game that every gamer need in his pc. 10/10 (ive been playing for over 42 hours these last three days)",1
"it was worth all the money, i love what this game offers. each mission contains a mystery, surprise and a perfect history from my point of view.i like how thieves get out of the bushes and try to steal your money,you wont see it,might scare sometimes and a lot more to love abouth this game,i write here, but it would mean a lot to read.you would not find a game like this for a while.show if you like rpg,try skyrim best of his kind.",1
"dragons. weapons. endless possibilities regarding skillsets, specialties, characters and race advantages, epic storyline with tons of sidequests, more dragons, choices in world-changing war sides - tl;dr it never gets boring.",1
"ran around a village naked, ate said villages supply of cheese wheels and bread, sprinted into the nearest woods to punch a bear to death then got launched into space by a giant. 11/10",1
"i had a copy from before, and my real timecount is around 500+ hours... i wish i could forget i ever played it at then play it again. enough said.",1
"cmon, its a elder scrolls game. of course you should buy it.",1
"where did all my time go???? yeah, thats right. skyrim.",1
"great game. id buy it twice ***edit june 2014*** bought it twice.",1
"i have waited 5 long years for this game since oblivion, and my expectations were completely blown away with its release. this game has not only surpassed the excellence set by its predecessors, it has actually set a very high benchmark for any future rpgs that will come after it. it has actually moved the genre forward in gaming, and playing it is like watching a glimpse of the future evolution of rpgs. as max scoville said in the destructoid video review of this game: i honestly think the game pushes the boundary of what art is. the world of skyrim is a virtual world. its a place you can legitimately get lost in. it should not only be applauded, it should be feared because turning off skyrim and going outside to ride the bus to work is like a dismal experience. i couldnt have said it better myself. no games are ever perfect but skyrim is as damn near to perfection as it can get. overall rating: 9.5 / 10 one of the best rpgs ever made, this game is a masterpiece.",2
"perfect! the most epic world of last gen... and one of the best rpg-worlds ever made... not for people with little time!",1
"the elder scrolls 5 skyrim simply put is a masterpiece. the graphics are eye wateringly georgeous especialy on ultra high quality, and the mods on pc just add even more to the game, totally worth your money every cent. if you buy the game i recommend the legendary edition. my rating 10/10 there will never be another game like this unless bethesda makes it.",2
"sit back, relax. forge your sword, sharpen the blade and be on your way. the journey of a thousand steps begins.",1
"every time i get remotley bored with this game, i find a new quest while aimlessly wandering or i just install a new mod that add even more content... if i could only have one game in my library for the rest of my life, this would be the game... its ok 7.6/10 ign",1
"skyrim is 2.49 at the moment, if you are considering it while browsing through the comments, stop, punch yourself in the face for even having a doubt and buy it now.",1
"with mods, it makes a solid game (excluding the various bugs) even better, yet it leaves much to be asked for.",1
"i personally loved this game. its very expansive and youll never run out of things to do, find, and kill. if you use mods your gonna get on at christmas and get off at christmas the following year! so, yes i very much love this game.",1
"great game and the story is relly aamazing if you like to fight in the ages of dragons",1
"skyrim is a fantastic game for role playing gamers.",1
"this game is absolutley tremendous i would advise everyone to buy this.",2
"lets be honest here. you should already have this game.",1
"omg this game has consumed my life for days and i been modded mopsting of the time just started playing 12 hours ago and i just stopped thanks skyrim now ima be lifeless for a while",1
"whenever i get to a great part in the game i delete my save by mistake hoping that quicksaves are still there but they delete themselves very often. worth buying it thought. 19/10 best exploring game in the world,hopefully till the next one.",1
"my favorite part is raising the baby dragons and using combos during the lydia sex scene.",1
"to be honest, im not a big fan of this game but i still recommend it because it can be brought to life with the modding community. the vanilla game alone isnt nearly as good as the older titles which i would most recommend if i had the steam versions. the older games, especially morrowind, had an impressive story, very well written. skyrims story was okay, i guess, but i kept getting off track. i especially love all the lore and references linking to the older games. i can go on and on, the game itself is not recommendable, but there are enough parts that i like to recommend this game not only to them casuals, but to elder scroll fans out there. with mods like ultimate combat, dragon combat overhaul, civil war overhaul, immersive creatures, immersive armors, immersive weapons, character creation overhaul with the various add-ons, pit fighter, perhaps even skyrealism...etc...you can brighten up the gameplay a bit more and make it interesting. personally i like the gameplay altering mods more but i do have a lot of other mods. again, the game alone isnt too good, but thats why the modding community is here, rather it be the workshop, nexus, planetelderscrolls, or some other place, theyre here to help.",2
"i went into the game on the back of rave previews which probably overhyped it for me. im a social gamer and i found the skyrim experience lonely and repetitive. its a massive leap forward for open world rpgs for the casual console gamer but coming from a background of mmos where the world is bigger, there are people everywhere to play with and teamwork actually exists... i was disappointed. even as an avid lover of classic rpgs with stories that tug on the heartstrings, i found little to lose myself in with skyrim. id recommend it for those that want to experience gaming as someone new to the medium, or even as a solid experience for an avid gamer. however, if you want something youll be playing for years... try an mmo. if you want a story/experience youll remember for the rest of your life... there are far better alternatives.",1
"if you liked tes4, youll love tes5 - skyrim does what oblivion did, but better. what bethesda lacks in the story-telling department (and some others) they make up for by being - hands down - the best in the industry at creating interesting worlds to explore. bethesda games are *very* exploration- and side-quest-heavy and this one is no different; if youre only interested in the main story youll breeze through skyrim in 4-6 hours. however, there is an abundance of quests (about 400) that arent connected to the main story and a ton of stuff to explore. if that kind of open-world feeling is what youre looking for in a game, youll easily get 100+ hours of enjoyment out of skyrim. there also is the creation kit, which will be released later in january and will, theoretically, allow for endless amounts of user-created content.",2
"a great game overall that has some nice features that the previous games in the series did not have. good graphics, great customization and dialogue but does not come near the swag of oblivion.",1
"this game is above epic, the possibilities are almost unlimited. be a magic user, a warrior, a battlemage, get married, adopt children, be an elf, be a cat! and save the world of skyrim from dragons! ... and evil dudes..!",1
"a flying mammoth flew down at me from the sky and mauled me. 77.2/10",1
"great sandboxey, but the main story gets bogged down in giant boring nonsense that youve seen a few thousand times. all the extra stuff is more interesting and engaging. i was actually sad when i had nothing but the main quest left and couldnt be bothered finishing it there. but that was still 80 hours running around, reading books, meeting people, getting involved in weird little quests. just, bleh on the main story. but who really just does the main story in these?",1
"its dangerous how amazingly addictive this game is, and since the pc version is modable be ready to throw your life away, if not playing the game then creating mods for it. as a slowly recovering addict i can easily look back on my two year love affair with skyrim and say its been a fantastically wild ride.",1
"if you havent played skyrim, you must astronishing. i recommend some mods though as the vanilla version is not nearly as amazing.",2
"epic game. outstanding gameplay and graphics, intuitive controls, and one of the best leveling systems ive come across. also has very high replay value, especially with the workshop and mods.",2
"i had never played any bethesda game before skyrim, and i assumed that this game was all hype. i was so wrong. when i first started it up, i said to myself: hey, this looks kinda cool, but i doubt that ill actually like it that much. once again, i was wrong. i know that im just repeating the words of other reviews when i say that there is so much to do, but its such a huge factor that im saying it anyway. i can run through the woods on my way to work on a quest, and i find a bandit lair, which is actually a huge dungeon, start up another story line from it, and then go back to my other quest. its amazing. the reason that i even bought skyrim in the first place was only from the repeated nagging of my friends. i got the legendary edition because this was during the big summer sale. i have no idea what the base game is like by itself. all i know is: being a vampire is awesome, and why would you choose to get the base game and not be a vampire, instead of spending a bit more and being a vampire? i know that i only have about 60 hours on record for skyrim, so i may not be the best source for review, but i plan on gaining plenty more in the future, because this game is something that i could never have imagined. one last thing: if you dont have skyrim, youre stupid. lets just put it at that. 12/10",1
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"i remember days like this when my father took me to the forest and we ate wild blueberries. more than 20 years ago. i was just a boy of four or five. the leaves were so dark and green then. the grass smelled sweet with the spring wind",1
"great immersive game! one of the best games i have ever played. boredom never will happen with the endless supply of workshop mods!!!!",2
"most addicting game ever!!! i normally dont like rpgs like this but its really good!",1
"the game allows you to take time at your own pace. it puts very little restriction on what you can do and rewards you the further you persevere through a single quest.",1
"absolutely amazing! phenomenal if you know how to mod!",2
"if you dont own this already i want you to cut a hole in your wall, go in it, patch the hole off, and live there forever, crying, for the rest of your life knowing that you never owned one of the best games of all time. im sorry for you, honestly.",1
"skyrim is a fantastic game, with mods of course. vanilla isnt awful but its not great. mods add great amounts of depth and greatly increase the graphical fidelity(if you have a powerful enough computer). all together i highly recommend skyrim since via pc mods are available. ps modding requires time and commitment be prepared if you wish to use mods.",1
"i think this might be the best video game i have ever played. cant stop playing the damn thing, and look foward to skyrim when i get home every day. i am pathetic ;)",1
"after having played the console version since 2011. this is a completely new game, totally refreshing.",1
"skyrim. what else needs to be said? top 10 game of all time.",1
"currently the best game ive ever played. few flaws for a bethesda launch. completely engrossing. gorgeous enviorments, well written stories, deep lore, epic soundtrack. cant ask for much more, and mods are on the way! buy this!",1
"the best rpg of the last 2-3 years. thats all. ------------------------------     2-3 . .",1
"i love this game and im not even finished with my first play through. i love to explore and the dlc just adds so much more to go and do. you revisit old areas with new objectives. new areas open for you to investigate. and there is a stream of modded content. even whole towns. always check the wiki if you take a new mission and watch out for bugs.",2
"this is a pretty fanatsic game and its really enjoyble so far.",1
"despite running the game at a horrible maximum of 20fps i get to kill flying chairs at 4k. 10/10 would mod until it crashes, then fix the crashes with mods.",1
"at first you are like this games fun, then you are like woah there are mods and then you dont stop the mods and then the next thing you know you are playing as a giant with a strap-on fighting thomas the tank engine",2
"the most perfect role-playing game in the world, which created the seven wonders of the worlds achievements as the same. i hope this role-playing game game is brings a whole new era, we dont need the fight monsters to level up of the role-playing game, we need a real rpg , allows us to have life experience in the games world. skyrim still not completely perfect for me, didnt like the 4th generation oblivion, brought about by the touched, oblivion is still the first in my mind.

"dont get this game! it ruined my life! after some time of playing skyrim i dropped my job, this casued me to run out of cash, slowly i began to sell all of my possesions in order to pay for the internet. i would leave the house to use internet cafes bu it is not socially acceptable to leave the house naked (as i sold my clothes) my addiction did not end here, i started buying new drugs so that i could stay up late into the night and had to turn to crime to afford them. after being caught at age 15 high, on skyrim playing naked i was put into a mental institute and hospitalised. now i have returned and skyrim was ready and waiting, i still play it solidly today, and i beg of you, do not buy this game it will ruin your lives!",1
"love this skyrim all i just do is fight die fight an die some more its a fun game im really happy to play it an i love this trailer so much <3 ps hav fun with the game just dont go near to a ganit ok love =d",1
"another winner from bethesda, skyrim continues the tales of the nations of tamriel and their struggles with the servants of daedra and divine alike. while it lacks some of the fun features of morrowind and oblivion (such as creating your own spells), its a good follow-up to those famous, well-loved titles. it can drag on a bit at times, with a lot of the quests having a distinct feeling of same task, different employer, but while that can make it hard to play, if you can power through then you will not be disappointed by the game.",1
"im pretty sure you arent going to see my review, considering that i am just one of the 32,812 people that did indeed review this game.",1
"the elder scrolls: mod till it crashes, contains horses that defy gravity, explosions that will send you back to oblivion, and hundreds of hours of side quests. 11/10 ign, its okay, i guess.",1
"probably the best open-world rpg out there. definitely one of my all-time favourite games. the replayability is superb and the modding community is highly active, which makes it easy to play the game the way you want to play it. for me the modding experience has been the greatest aspect of the game. you can easily make the game graphics look like up to date games (as long as you have a decent graphics card). the atmosphere in the game and the way the game feels alive is something that will keep amaze you throughout the game. it really feels like a living world, even though you will stumble upon bad or awkward npc movements and behaviour (but mods can help fix this). the music and voice acting is as good as it can get. if you like rpgs there are no reasons why you shouldnt own this game already. 10/10.",1
"graphics are amazing the story line is good and the mods man, the mods!",1
"its a brilliant game and great value in the sales but the dragonborn patch introduced a pretty bad lipsync issue that bethesda probably arent going to fix, not a huge issue but its good that people be aware.",3
"this game can be a dream of awesomness if you want it to be you can have naruto fighting ermac from mk 9 its a beast  game and for 7 bucks one hell of a deal",3
"a i have so many mods for this game i forgot what the original looked like. instead of fighting dragons, im fighting tomas and his friends.",1
"if you dont know how awesome this game is already where have you been?",1
"one of the most suck-in video game experience, 90/100 third time playthrough, still not bored ^^",1
"it doesnt launch for me fix it! even if i wait an hour it wont launch.",1
"masses left naked on the streets. they suspect nothing.",1
"excellent visiuals, good story, and a very immersive enviroment. you can spend weeks traversing the land and never getting bored. buy it if you can and prepare to lose days of your life.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a fun and addicting game that plays nicely with mods and add-ons promising hours of gameplay. not only does this game provide an open world rpg sandbox-ish feel, it has tons of possibilites in the right hands, if i could i would honestly give this game a 6/5.",2
"heh, i got bragging rights now. this is really fun, a couple of my friends are asking from me for a copy!",1
"great game, just dont get shot in the knee with an arrow",2
"one of the best games ever. get the skyui mod and some graphics ones too if you really like it. make it yours :) i spent all my time doing the theives guild and dark brotherhood quests, you can do whatever you want, dont even have to do the main quest...though killing dragons is fun (and lucrative!)",3
"the vanilla game is enjoyable, but i cannot recommend it, as it is nothing compared to the game where you employ mods. for those out there that either fear or detest the lore-breaking aspect of mods, im not asking you to download a school uniform or a xxxxxl bust size for your character. im asking you to look at the effort put in by the community of modders who strive to make the game a more enjoyable experience for all, like skyui or falskaar.",1
"i frickin love this game , this adrenaline , the story is amazing , so are the details and i like that the game works on low-end pcs ;3",1
"this is an awesome game! i love the elder scrolls games. i started playing es when es3 morrowind came out on the original xbox. played & beat es4 oblivion on xbox 360 like 4 times & i played & beat skyrim on the ps3. i just picked this game up at walmart for $19.99! steam has it for $29.99! i have been wanting to get it on pc for a while after seeing all the workshop mods for it, but i didnt want to pay $40+ for a game i had already beat... one cool thing about this disc copy is, i installed from the disc & it auto installed it to my steam account. dont even need the disc to play it. i highly recommend this game. if you want to get it, go to walmart & buy it. save youreself $10!",1
"the game itself is a masterpiece of storytelling, mechanics and lore. just cant believe how compelled i am to always come back to it. i started on xbox and loved it so much that i bought it on pc too and gave that modding thing a shot. cant tell you how great the modding community is and the endless possibilities it provides to the gameplay experience. a definite buy!!! fun, fun, fun!",1
"very dissapointing. there is little variety between quests, with most of them becoming, go to this burial site, fight generic skeletons, get to the end and take a shortcut that leads right back to the beginning. quest completions have little to no impact on gameplay either; you can easily become the master of every guild and no one cares. loot drops are very generic. cities are void of any real amount of people but it doesnt matter because theres only like 4 voice actors anyway. i hate to say it but skyrim has made slaying dragons boring.",1
"its pretty late to write a review for skyrim, but here goes anyway. skyrim is a game where you are a person/creature called the dragonborn, and hunt down dragons. the dragonborn can absorb the souls of dragons, killing them permanently, and using the knowledge from that soul for your own strength. you learn different shouts (powers) from ancient walls with dragon language on them. these powers are the main element of the game. as for the options, you can be a powerful mage, a mighty warrior, a sneaky thief, a skilled craftsman, an alchemist, or a mixture of everything! you can take on huge side quests, such as joining a guild of thieves or assassins, a tea party with a madman, visiting a museum, or ending the current war going on. there are several ruins to delve into, bounties to collect, cities to live in, and trolls to kill. of course, you will need a decent computer for this to run smoothly. there are quite a few bugs, but never enough to break the immersion. hours upon hours of gameplay, but as far as the main quest, is lacking. theres just not enough. but all the other things you can do, make up for it. the possibilities with this game are endless! final score: 9.5/10",3
"hours of fun, even when you complete the game its fun to mod",1
"skyrim. simply a masterpiece! if you buy this game, ill assure you that youll waste half your life playing it! it does feel dumbed down compared to the previous elder scrolls, and the rewards for completing quests seems next to useless, but skyrim makes up for it in an amazing array of interesting quests, a beautiful world and mods like no tomorrow! i highly recommend.",2
"i dont think i can say anything that hasnt already been said. kill dragons, explore, get epic loot, win!! its a great game, give it a go!",1
"on the scale of visearys golden hat to dannys sweet rack, would bang.",1
"best game ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i have this game on two consoles! countless hour spent on this game!!!",1
"a.k.a. where did my life go? or, the best zelda game ive ever played. seriously though, some of my favorite moments in zelda games are when you happen upon a random hidden cave and get to explore it. skyrim is like a whole game of that. its a whole 10 games of that. its not so great on puzzles, and like most games, can suffer from some cheesey voice-acting, but that never derailed me from obsessively roaming around the vast landscape, getting side-tracked from the tangent that i went on during a sidequest on my way somewhere for somebody that had something to do with a main quest...",2
"me addicted to this.. and it never end.. beware! took a lot of my time.. still playing..",1
"very good game. open world rpg love just exploring and the different quest lines for guilds. 10/10",1
"there really is nothing i can say about this game that hasnt already been said. its not the greatest game of all time, but its my favorite tes title of all time. it may not have the depth of morrowind, or the scope of daggerfall, but it certainly has the epic embrace of tes while still playing like a dream. a vast improvement over oblivions kind of lackluster sameness, i highly recommend it to any rpg gamer, or anybody looking for a deep game with amazing lore and lots of fighty dragons.",3
"09:00am - i gonna play this game just for 10 minutes, thats it! 22:00pm - wat time is it again?",1
"with workshop intergration, and the skyrim nexus, skyrim is one of the most replayable games you can purchase on steam. although there can be bugs and glitches from time to time, this game for the most part plays perfectly. with the added hd textures dlc, plus other graphical inhancer mods, this game is beautiful. many quests to choose from, some of the quest lines do feel rushed out or as some would call it filler, but for the most part that game has some very intresting quests... i wouldnt call skyrim my favorite game of all time, but its up there, definantly in my top 10...",1
"mountain climbing simulator 2011 is one of the best simulator games i have ever played. only down side is that they tried to tie in a plot into this. yes, a little back story is kinda good on why you must climb so many mountains, but this game just takes it over the top. 9.75/10. remove the plot; add more mountains. then it will be 10/10.",1
"the best rpg so far and runs smoolthly as one would like to see.",2
"i start a new character every time i play because its so good.",1
"one of the best games ive played in a over a decade. combat system is fantastic. leveling/specialty system just right, not so complicated you have to restart if you spend a wrong talent but not so simple that it makes the game easymode. questing system has voice acting for all quests even the small ones rather than just walls of text which really helps to not make the quests feel like chores but actually fun gameplay. not to mention the main questline so far is very interesting, well organized lore and keeps you pushing to learn more. the environment in the game is beautiful and filled with little easter eggs here and there. like all games of this size though it has a few bugs, ive been getting crashes every now and then but theyve all been right after an autosave so i didnt lose progress. ive gotten stuck in some places and had to reload from a previous point, this however has caused a loss of progress. the last of the very few complaints is about the horses. you will end up buying a new horse frequently, even if you keep the horse away from battle it will usually find its way to you mid fight and dies very easily. seeing a giant toss a horse 200ft in the air is pretty amusing though. (normally it doesnt fly near that high but the giants are buggy.) all around excellent game, and i would give it a 9/10.",2
"gorgeous game. not as good as oblivion, but a great way to spend an afternoon lost in the outstanding storyline. 9/10",1
"one of the top five games that ive had the priviledge of playing... the only thing that i would say that gets old about this game is the voices (they can get reppetative after 60+ hours in it).",1
"this game must be my all time favourite. for multiple reasons. it is highly enjoyable, contains almost infinite amounts of gameplay (especially with the dlc, which are all worth the price!) and is overall amazing. while it has its problems (repetive dragons, bugs, the usual), the good things easily outweight those. also, modding. do that .",1
"omg this game rulz. lolz, rotfl. best game evar! buy one for each of your childrenz!",2
"played this game for many hours, and its still not boring...just awesome.... :d",1
"if you havent bought this game yet, then what are you doing with your life",2
"an awesome game, highly recommended for any rpg fans. the elderscrolls series is about the most open-world, do-what-you-want-when-you-want kind of game. because of this, the main-story can suffer somewhat because there is no need to follow and you can just never do it if you want...but thats the beauty of an open-world game. the sidequests and wandering around beautiful and very varied landscapes playing different roles and doing whatever you want lends itself to 100+ hours of fun...all for relatively cheap now-a-days.",1
"yet another amazing addition to tes series. there is a difference in game mechanics that has upset some people, but i dont see any major flaws in the game, and i really enjoy the freedom of play style with no class restrictions.",1
"a masterpiece, a must and a great adventure ahead. this game is almost infinite, you have so many things to do that at some point you will be overwhelmed by missions, a map big as hell, beautiful landscapes that will marvel you, you wont be dissapointed at all. maybe a bad thing are the crashes that some times happen during gameplay, but they are a minor detail next to the great storyline and adventures this game has to offer. totally recommended!",1
"this is one of the most realistic graphics game if u know the sotry from elder scrolls oblivion and morrwind this game will be a hobby :) recommanded for everyone",1
"what can i say? ive been playing elder scrolls since the first one, and every one has gotten better. this is no exception. the level of immersion in the story is indescribable. add to that exceptional gameplay, almost unlimited replayability, and a great ai, and you have the recipe for one of the best crpg experiences to date. unhesitatingly, unabashedly, unreservedly recommended.",2
"they should just rename this game; waifu creator 3000. 5/5",2
"great game, big... and customization is making it even better.",1
"this game is so frickin amazing i bought it twice, steam and xbox.",1
"if you dont want to get an addiction, dont start playing this game :)",1
"ive spent over 200 hours playing it - that should speak for itself",1
"must-buy, highly addictive and extremely fun game. just shut up and go buy it, lol.",1
"this game is awsome!! i had never played any of the previous elder scrolls games so when this came out i didnt give it a second thought but a friend convinced me to play this at his place and i was addicted. it does a really good job of bringing you into the world and making you feel like you need to make a difference. it has one or two problems like repetitive speech from the npcs and ocasional graphical glitch but dont worry you will hardly notice. now i am looking forward to elder scrolls online, i hope it can be even better.",1
"people keep talking about going outside but i dont understand what that means.",1
"skyrim. nuff said. simply amazing. also, makes the console version look like a joke.",1

"in my opinion this game is an awesome rpg with a pretty good story line and lots of open world gameplay and locations to discover with side quests that will keep you occupied and lots of diffrent mods you can download to make the game even better.in the main quest line you play as the dragonborn on your quest to stop the dragons and alduin, the dragon that is bringing the other dragons back to life.and with the dragonborn and dawnguard dlc it adds extra quest lines that that can be longer than the main quest line.so i just think the game is really fun.",1

"so good i bought it twice. get this or fail at being a gamer.",1
"this is probably one of the best games ive ever played. ever.",1
"10/10, game of the year. i dont care which year. all of them. this game is by far, without a doubt, my favourite game of all time. its immersion is unmatched, the story is amazing, the graphics on pc are absolutely stunning. its one of the most actively modded games around if not the single most modded. if youre thinking about buying it, do it now, you wont regret it. its so cheap for what you get in return. best game ive ever played. wish i had bought it before, but from 11/11/11 until the recent sale, ive played it for thousands of hours...outside of steam.",1
"this is an amazing rpg game that has countless hours of content on it.",1
"this game. for starters i am a huge fan of bethesda games and elder scrolls series. after absolutely  oblivion i was circumed to buying skyrim. originally bought on my ps3, i grabbed it as a bargain in the steam sales and exams has been a blocker for me. the mods are simple but great and it has a gripping storyline. one of the best games ive ever played. to put you in the steps of the saviour of tamriel again is a great feeling. would recommend to everyone and their grandmas. 11/10",1
"what can be said that hasnt been said before except, skyrim is 90% of what a truly perfect pc rpg should be; all that it requires is the level of interpersonal communication that is found in the dragon age series and it would be the perfect game.",2
"so damn addictive.. played till 5 am in the morning.. got up at 11:30 and started playing again :d .. dayum!!",1
"200 hours later, im not sure i should have played this, but it was certainly good...",1
"great open world game. the steam workshop mods really help to personalize the game to your liking. i would reccomend to this to any person starting in rpgs.",1
"this game is very fun! i have always liked it on consoles and have beaten it on there, but i bought it on pc for the summer sale. you can do much more on the pc, it doesnt take forever to load, it looks prettier, and you can run mods on it. this game is a great rpg and is worth the money. (i would get it before the steam sale is over for a simply 5 usd)",1
"spent countless hours on the xbox version and pc, and i can honestly say this game dosent dissapoint and there is no other game that is worth getting!",2
"i recommend this game because it is a very exciting game with alot of weird and creepy things including ancient nord ruins, falmer, etc. but the main reason why i like it is because there is alot of roleplay and stuff to do, earn, and mess around with. its one of my favorites and ive had this game a while on my xbox. but with the whole moding experience id say it is pretty crazy and awesome! you should get it.",1
"do not! i repeat do not buy this game if you have other things to do. there is so much to do, so many places to explore and so many ways to play. this game is truly a life destroyer. you will become so inthralled with the story anf world that it feels more real than the one out side the computer screen. plus you get to ride dragons! i mean real dragons! maybe i just need help, maybe i need a therapist, or drugs. but this game is by far the best i have played since arcanum. this is a must buy and a must play. just be sure you have plenty of vacation and sick days to take off work.",1
"its good but dont overload your skyrim game with mods, if you do it will screw up your data. if you want mods i would suggest picking no less then 4 mods i recommend inigo alot if you like talkitive companions",1
"quite honestly, i thought i would regret buying this game again after having 100s of hours in it on xbox 360. oddly enough, i didnt. even after completing everything this game has to offer (which i might add, is a ton), mods give this game a complete new life. sure, skyrim isnt the best elder scrolls to date, but its pretty damn good. even if youve played it on a console system before, its not the same. this game is a must have for any rpg lover.",1
"a vast and beautiful world where you can get caught up with a severe case of wanderlust. game of 2011, and thats a bold statement considering this has been an amazing year for games.",1
"wow this awsome game but try do what they want you do",1
"as all of the elder scrolls games, this one is a mod fest. with them, its awesomeness is almost unlimited.",1
"if you are ever forced into a situation where you can only buy one game on your pc then make it a bethesda game and make it morrowind. unless you want to have epic battles with dragons then make it skyrim. as usual this game is one that impacts an entire generation. an absolutely massive game, with solid mechanics, beautiful graphics and an  ton of glitches. thankfully, due to the massive moding community you can fix everything in a few seconds and then take the game to an entirely new level that is customized to your personal tastes and persuasions. more gushing about the game can be found here on my blog, which is the blog to end all blogs:",1
"easier for me to play with a usb xbox controller than my mouse. mouse has terrible sensitivity. but anyways. fantastic game. already knew how to play from watching others play a lot. look forward to logging more hours on it.",1
"one of the best open-world fantasy adventure games in a long time, i absolutely love this game.",1
"i wouldnt have expected any less from the elder scrolls series. its a great game that has a little something for everyone. the sole thing i didnt enjoy as much as i did in oblivion is that the game turned into more of a dungeons and dragons type thing as for the better part of the game thats all you seem to be doing. luckily, the daedric quests are great fun and provide a bit of much needed variety.",1
"skyrim. this game..... much ldragonborn such adventure wow",1
"i have spent way, way too much time on this game, and i keep coming back to it to do more. at some point here i need to get around to finishing the main quest line. :)",1
"this game is great. was great until the bugs set in. this game is really fun and really addictive to play, theres a  ton to do and you can play how you want, but its buggy as . after a certain amount of time, actions started being really delayed or outright refused to work, for example the shout walls in the game which give you good abilities to make you more powerful started outright refusing to work, i can no longer gain these abilities because the game has ed out on me and i cant seem to fix it. the mods in the game manage to make the game at least 12 times more fun at least.",1
"a wonderful rpg that should not be missed by any lord of the rings, game of thrones, and the hobbit. one of my all time favorite games and the mods!!!! make this game so much better and add over 30 hours of gamplay. you can even download all of morrowinds missions to skyrim and play them in new revized manner with. a 8.9 outta 10 in my book.",1
"im sure not much has to be said about this game. it is the fantasy rpg for any and all whether it be long-time fans of the elder scrolls franchise or first-time players. compelling storyline, hours of content, great dlc, user-friendly interface, and steam achievements. what else could you want in a game?",2
"amazing and highly addictive. a must play for any rpger",1
"probaly one of my favourite games ever even in 2014 its mods and dlcs just push it over the edge. 10/10",1
"it all started when i bought a copy of the elder scrolls v: skyrim for the xbox 360... i started playing and i thought.. wow this is pretty cool... 400 hours later i found out the pc version had community mods. it was convienient the summer steam sales were on. i bought the game and that was the decision that destroyed me... since then i have been through many many counciling sessions but they never work. it is like a super drug... i think to myself.. i will only play for 30 mins, the next time i look at the clock 6 hours have past. my doctor says i need to quit, its not healthy for me to be on it all day. but i sneak in small doses when no one is around... dont get this game... it will be the worst decision of your life.. you dont want to end up in addiction therapy like me.",1
"maybe im an extrange case, but i never get tired of starting a new character again and again, with +300 hours on console i never reached level 40. here is an advice for console users: if you ever get bored of skyrim (exceptional case) get it for pc and explore the broad range of possibilities that mods add to it. once a month i check nexus webpage or steam workshop and add a few mods.",1
"there are video games and then there is skyrim. enough said.",1
"this game is simply awesome its my second day having it and i have 26 hours. if you are thinking of buying it dont hesitate.",1
"this is amazing game. please, dont use mods at you first gaming. when this game will become boring fot you, use mods and youll interest in this game again. skyrim is the greatiest rpg of the centure.",1
"mind boggline amount of content. 2+ years after its release and i still havent found everything",2
"i have played many many hours on this game and loved every minute of it. the game is huge, vast amounts of land to cover, great characters you encounter. the towns are always a good stop for supplies, rest and getting new quests. the real joy in skyrim is the combat, wether you play as a warrior, using 1 or two handed weapons, or stealth and archery there are unique actions that always make the combat a joy to play. stealth really works well in this game, become a thief or a killer hiding in the shadows, there is a great selection of weapons and armours to find and upgrade. being the dragonborn really adds a great element to the game with shouts. i could not even remember all the great moments and fun in the game, its huge and just a major achievement in gaming. skyrim is amazing.",5
"this is a super addictive game i have spent over 200 hours on the xbox 360 version of this and it is very enjoyable rpg. there are loads of things to do in this game. there is no point in playing the main story because its very boring unless you have nothing else to do in the game. i found myself starting a new character when i got bored of the game. i never ran into any glitches and that was even in 2011. when you get completley bored of the game, it isnt the end. you can download mods from steam workshop or nexus it will give you many more hours of gameplay. this game is a masterpiece i give it a 10/10 i would recommand this to any rpg gamer.",1
"233 hours and counting... i regret nothing! someday, i hope to find another love like this <3",1
"an extremely shallow rpg. the ui is a mess, clearly designed for ease of access on consoles. quests are barely more than fetch this and that or kill him, with little dialogue to encourage the character from a roleplaying standpoint, and feels so repetitive that its dull to play. it honestly plays more like a first person arpg, but lacks the depth of a well fleshed out combat system to support the lack of depth in characters and lore. the engine is showing its age, and is wrought with bugs. textures are small and sometimes simply mapped wrong. everything feels copy and pasted, like this was done by an intern looking to prove he could work with the engine. community mods might be enough to save this, but for now, id stick with morrowind. if you are a fan of easy gameplay and immersive bloom filled graphics take precedence over dialogue and story, play this. if you want a deep, fulfilling rpg that you wont mind replaying 5 years from now, save your money and look elsewhere.",1
"with mods i can be a dancing skeleton and marry a dog. all my fantasies in one game. 10/10",1
"lesson iv learnt while modding skyrim is: if your computer can play skyrim without a struggle you dont have enough mods installed 10/10",1
"no doubt the best bethesda has every released. an absoute must buy for any elder scrolls fan.",1
"love this game! highly recommended. i love the freedom you have in the game to do whatever you want and be whoever you want to be. sometimes its nice to just sit down and admire the beautiful graphics.",1
"awsome story, prepare the  (no it isnt just for fps)",1
"excellent! endless things to do. great mod community too.",1
"this is such a great game, one of the bests i ever played. if you like rpg in a open world with freaking great graphics i recomend you to buy it. if you get it on sale even better ^^",1
"wow, cant begin to descibe how good this game is.... when i first heard about people talking about this game i automatically assumed they were nerds, but playing this doesnt make you feel like you are playing dungeons and dragons, or wow. it feels like you are another person, choosing your own path; slaughtering innocent townspeople, becoming a hero who wants to protect all that is right, or even becoming a master vampire and living out in the marsh with a house you built (dlc required). the landscapes are stunning, the ai is, i cant say the best, but compared to games like just cause 2 and and arma 2, they are much better. i spent 250 hours playing vanilla, and still have not completed the dawnguard questline as a dawnguard member, or finished the companion questline (i hate the companions if you buy the game hopefully you will agree with me), and still am doing quests. need cash and love killing? join the dark brotherhood, a ancient organization which carries out assinations. want to be a master wizard (you get to zap people with lightning and )? join the mage college of winterhold. after 250 hours i got mods which made the game so much better. buy it. stop wasting your time trying to find out if its good, because it is.",2
"what can i say it is an awesome game and you have to play it now.it is a interesting game to play because there is so many things to do in the game!! and you get to kill stuff. so get it now!! ;) and leave comments xd",2
"some dude in whiterun asked if i ever tried mercenary work, and that it might suit me. i tried mercenary work. it suited me. 11/10",1
"pretty good. if you mod the  out of it it becomes amazing.",1
"great game! loads of content and replay ability! one of my favorite games of all time!",2
"awesome game, ive played hours upon hours. pc is a whole new world for skyrim.",1
"awesome game 10/10 gota have a good pc to run it tho",1
"better map. better setting. better story. playing a destruction mage sucks. i give the beard selection three out of four beards. looking forward to oblivion 3.0.",1
"filled jorrvaskr with cheese, spawned 5 sheogoraths, and then fell through the ground. 10/10 would do the fishstick again.",1
"its not the best game ever, nor not even close in my book for deserving that title, but it is a good game and deserves to be played if you like rpgs.",1
"best rpg i have ever played! i played this on console and when i downloaded it for pc it was even better! because of the mods :d",1
"this is better than real life after playing skyrim 600+ hours on my xbox i decided to buy it for my laptop after trying it on my bros computer (50 hours. a pretty long trial) so packed full of mods this game is still not an inch boring. i can only recommend it, but be wary that this could destroy your life (t the graphic is in comparison to other games almost unmatched, since you can install many awesome enbs and mods to enhance the game. its allready huge in the vanilla version, and with mods it will get much bigger have fun playing this!",1
"if you some how dont have this game, you should change that",1
"the xbox ones graphics really do this game justice. the graphics are really good. i would highly recommend it.",1
"thoroughly enjoyed the game. it has a brilliant open world experience and i felt free to do whatever i pleased. i highly recommend this as a roleplaying game and open world game to everyone and anyone.",2
"every elder scrolls sequel takes out little things that i end up missing. from morrowind to oblivion and from oblivion to skyrim, there are minute aspects of the game that i want back. that being said, every sequel becomes a little more grand in scope. the graphics improve exponentially of course, but your character also becomes a bigger part of the world s/he is playing in. the powers become more powerful, the antagonists become more antagonizing and overall, the experience is grander and more fulfilling. so yeah, i want my medium armour back, and yeah i didnt like peryites quest, but these are things i can do without. the only legitimate gripe i have with skyrim is the way it was ported. the game, the controls, the menus and pretty much everything about it was designed for consoles. its not something that makes the game un-playable by any means, but its an invasive enough problem that 50 or 100 hours in, im still noticing it. that being said, its a game that one can play for 50, 100, 200 or even more hours. and its worth it.",2
"this game was one of the first i wanted to try out on my new pc and boy is it a good one. some minor gripes would be the glitchy map occasionally and the fact that your horse can die but that is all negated by the crisp, clean graphics and the gripping but sandboxy storyline. 9.5/10",1
"i always wanted to be harry potter using magic, for sexyness.",1
"awesome sprawling game. i suggest a low to nonmagic build. it seems futzing with magic gets hard fast.",1
"skyrim is beyond massive. the world is colourful and immersive, and theres always something for you to do. want to rampage as a werewolf? eat their hearts out. want to mine and craft and sell? go be a merchant and mine everything from everywhere and craft jewelry and armor and weapons! the game has everything and more. its only downside is that it is too immersive; you can lose hours of your life on here without even realizing it.",2
"i have already put 320+ hours into this game and it still stays strong: so much to do, so much to discover... lots of great quests nearly everywhere, ruins to explore and the opportunity to enjoy a world that lives and breathes on its own.",2
"as the fifth installment of the elderscrolls series, it is truly everything an adventurer and a roleplayer could hope for. explore a vast region of a world as detailed as the one we all live in. from the southern most city of riften, with its birch filled woods and highway travelers. to the barbaric mineraltown of markarth with its cold winds and viking like people, you will surley find something to be inspired by. the countless hours you will spend to just scratch the surface of this huge world will be filled with friends and foes. whether its a farmer asking for help with his crops, an ancient vampire haunting a town, a troll attacking a trading camp or a legacy of a dragonborn hero waiting to be fullfilled, everything is there for you to experience. i could go on forever trying to explain how vast this game is, but i took an arrow to my knee and now i just want a belly full of mead.",1
"one of the best elder scrolls game out, the base game has a great main quest line and if you get bored of that you have 100s+ side quests to do, or you could go around finding little hiddle spots around the map. the dawnguard dlc is fun and gives you alot more side quests with a good main quest line. but the best dlc so far has to be the dragonborn dlc im still going through doing the black books i mean theres alot of stuff to do so you wont get bored with the plot and say omg this sucks why did i even buy it because i love it. overall the game is great, plus all the mods you can download really gives the game alot of life and stuff to do. i give this game a perfect 10/10 an amazing game please do buy.",1
"wow. the only word that i can use to describe this game is misleading. i have over 320 hours on this game, and i have yet to even see the skyrim. ive tried googling the location of the rim, but to no avail. this game doesnt even have helicopters to use to even get to the rim! like, wtf activision? fix your game. this is the biggest waste of 74 euros ever. i even installed the beautiful males mod because i got tired of looking at battlefield to get me off, and that doesnt even do it. the  physics are atrocious. no flopping, no particle effects, nothing. why would you put naked men in the game if it isnt even arousing? i guess the snow is ok, but nowhere near the quality of the snow in that one level of call of duty. i cant remember which one, though. graphics - 2/10 gameplay - 1/10 (waaayyyy better on consoles)  physics - 2/10 (left too much to the imagination) snow - 6/10 (im being generous with this one) overall - 10/10 - a fantastic game with an amazing storyline. you can play it fer dayz.",1
"i have played too much to turn back now. adictive!",1
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"really could not play this much longer than a few hours, the movement just did not feel right.",1
"lets get right to it. as far as playability goes (ease, expansiveness, etc), i would give it a 9 out of 10. i only take off a point because the game can be a bit glitchy at times. but this is to be expected from any game with an open world enviornment. visuals are a 10 out of 10. the developers put so much time and effort into this game and it really shows. i play on ultra high and the graphics are amazing to look at from atop a mountain in the game. yes, not everyone can play with the graphics way up, but it is visually stunning all the same. re-play value is off the charts. 12 out of 10. i have had this game for x box, and pc alike, putting over 400 hours combined into this game and i never get tired of it. truly one of the greats when it comes to replay value. dlc- 8 out of 10. they really tried, and it still has the skyrim/ dragonborn feel to it, but it simply isnt quite as good as it could have been. they are definitely good for a one time play through for all the loot and new quests, but some of the quests feel cumbersome and it makes rare gems much to common. loot is basically given away in the dlcs. overall rating 9.5 out 0f 10. no one should pass up playing this game and lately it has been on sale a lot for very cheap. i highly recommend this.",1
"best first person shooter horror game ive ever played",1
"i dont know how i came to like this game so much, but once you play it, it impresses you again and again.",1
"probably one of the best games ive ever played, if not the best. go hand-to-hand, use axes, swords, maces, battle axes, fire, ice, lightning, conjure allies to assist in your fight, or alter the battlefield in your favor. use any of these tools, and more, to fill out your destiny as dragonborn in a plot developed by the geniuses behind oblivion. 10/10 is my rating. oh, did i mention the hundreds of sidequests? your going to be in skyrim for a while, and youll relish every second of it!",1
"perfect for all your cabbage harvesting simulator needs. i died when i tripped over a saucepan. highly recommended.",2
"skyrim is a fantastic game, one of my absolute favorite games of all time, its beautiful, moddable, challenging, open world amazing, if i made a lengthy review, all the text could be translated into a very simple picture of me giving bethesda fellatio and enjoying it..... no homo, the game is simply that good.",2
"really fun if you like knights, dragons, vikings, gods, demons, etc.",1
"legendary edition is way worth the price. all 3 dlc packs bring more armor sets and questchains to the game, which really enhances the playthrough.",1
"skyrim is easily one of the best games ive ever played. im still relatively new to the elder scrolls franchise (having only played oblivion before this) but i feel its fair to say that this game is probably the strongest entry into the franchise yet. its got the usual attention to detail youd come to expect from bethesda, with the lore, lands, and characters all being well designed and very, very impressive. that along with the wonderful gameplay make for a great game that will eat up your time like nobodys business. highly recommended. especially to fans of fantasy, the fallout series, or the previous elder scrolls games.",1
"i played about 200 hours with skyrim (dont let the steam playtime fool you, i have played this game long before i had this copy) and what does not stop to amazeme, is the absolute randomness and the unending content in it. and im not just talking about modded skyrim! even without mods, with the randomly generated missions you can literally play it forever and it will never end. no extra dlc, no monthly fee, no subscription to anything... you just download it once, play it forever. and just when you think: ah yes, but its the same stuff over and over again, then you step out of a cave, a dragon flies over your head, lands on the ground. you attack it with your companions, shouting and charging, when suddenly some giants join the fight. you kill them all in an epic fight and ride off into the sunset. and that is just one story of many...",1
"open-world rpg. pretty good, and can get even better with mods of your choosing.",1
"this game is pretty much amazing and is the king of rpgs. additional use of the workshop can improve graphics and game play further to your liking which just makes it even better (highly recommend using the workshop from the get-go). warning: this game is big and as a result it takes a while to get into it. i find a lot of people do not enjoy the first 1-2 hours of game play. that may seem like a lot, but this game easily consumes over 100 hours and so the beginning is relatively small. additionally, this game is focused on the rpg and story aspects and less so on the combat. the combat is good but its nothing fancy.",1
"me what a great game. a must have. one of the greatest games atm 10/10",1
"this game is perfect for the rpg diehards and noobs. (also, i timed the words fus ro dah with my sneeze and im never going back)",3

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a great game, and even with the mighty console commands available, the game takes a long time to thoroughly beat. i cant even begin to get into the fact you can mod the game to extend the fun even further, because frankly that would just give me far too much to talk about. even with all i just said though, i believe there is currently a problem with skyrim on steam, because when i tried to play it on a different computer, it didnt show up in my games list like it always has in the past, and then my friend purchased the game, the money was taken from his bank account, yet no purchase verification from steam was sent to his e-mail, and the game never showed up in his library. an hour since the initial purchase and still not even a verification e-mail actually. i would simply recommend doing a little research to see how many people are having issues with skyrim (or perhaps even steam purchase problems in general at the time i am typing this) before making the purchase.",1
"skyrim is a good rpg, but not a great one. i have been an avid fan of the elder scrolls series since morrowind back when i was a wee lad playing that lovely dirt-colored game on my brothers original xbox back in 2003-2005. anyways, i was expecting this game to be a more refined version of oblivion, which has a special place in this cubans heart, but skyrim was different. it felt targeted for a broader audience, not one the typical bethsesda rpg fan like me and many others. forgive the word, but skyrim is the epitome of a casual rpg. if my brother, the same brother who bought morrowind for me and my other brother back in 2003 but hated it, can sink hours into this game like it was call of duty, then it definitely is a casual rpg. does that make it bad? god no! skyrim is an extremely pretty game that i would love to indulge myself in if i had more time to. i just feel like if anyone can pick, swing a sword, and kill  in an rpg, it is casual. try doing that in oblivion against some tougher creatures and your  will become mudcrab food along the shores of that bloom covered and colorful land.",1
"this a absulutly beutiful game and has tons of dungeons caves and other things that you can find your self like dark brother hood a group oh assassians",1

"one of the best... anyone who enjoys open world rpgs should definatly buy this game. the gameplay is fun, the modding comunity is massive ( so there ae always good mods available), the storys quite good, and its got decent graphics, definatly one of the best rpg games on steam. 9.5/10",1

"best elder scrolls game in the series. and the whole series is really good!",1
"skyrim doesnt simply live up to the pre-release hype, its actually even better. the combat and skill progression systems are perfect and allow for varied playing styles, and the story is epic. but what elevates skyrim to another level is just how beautiful and alive the world is. the graphics are stunning and every location is unique. npcs do their own thing based on time of day and theres lots of varied wildlife. one time i cleared out a fort which was held by bandits. next time i passed by, the imperial army had moved in. skyrim is also huge. after 45 hours ive finished the main quest, done a small part of the warriors and mages guild quests, and a bunch of misc quests. but i havent even touched the thieves guild, dark brotherhood or civil war quests, and there are 4 major cities i havent visited yet. this amount of content is unprecedented. theres no doubt that skyrim is by far the best game of 2011, but im actually thinking it just might be the best game ever.",2

"in my time skyrim has been one of the best games ive ever played.it has all you need for an indulging play. if you like medievil, dragon age, steel clashing things then i suggest skyrim. i like skyrim for the freedom and the fact you dont need to choose a class you can make one be it, ranger, mage, battle-mage, warrior, swordsman, theif, assasin etc. its your choice. dlcs are a good addon but they are quiet pricey so the cheapest and the best(in my view) is hearthfire, the others yea, killing fighting but hearthfire is one of my favourite. you can build your own house which i think is pretty cool and raise a familiy. so yes i suggest skyrim i think its a great game and you should play it.",1
"does this game even need a review? i mean, seriously, it is one of the best games on the pc to date and defines the western rpg genre with sheer greatness and popularity.",1
"it really is a good game..good for people who like action or just plaine mmo gaming...its a big girrafe",1

"i have the legendary edition and i must say skyrim is the most awesome game i have ever played to date. the year is 2013, 2 years since skyrim was released, and i think this is the best time to play this game since most will now be able to actually experience this at its highest visual splendor as the required hardware to run it smoothly are now more affordable. i believe i will play this game for a looooong loooong time.",1
"friend told me to put caqs in commands and i got 100% achevements 10/10",1
"this game isnt as vast and expansive as oblivion, but people must understand that with todays technology, it would take a signifigantly larger amount of time and resources to recreate something that big with a new engine. that being said, the enviornment is still extremley varied, and assuming you dont fast travel all the time, its still a huge map. the enemies are varied, combat feels satisfying when you beat someone, and many new or improved features exist because of the developers lessons learned from oblivion, and fallout 3/nv. this game will feel familar, yet different. in some time the development tools will be released for pc, and the game can only get better. highly reccomended it to anyone who can pull themselves away from the cliches of bf3 or mw3.",3
"this is another grand additon tho the elder scrolls sereries i highly recommend",1
"after playing this game for countless of hours. i can tell for a fact that this is one of the best games ive ever played in my entire life. i cant get enough of this game. specially the modding community. there is just so much about this game that you cant just play this game in one week. you have to take your time when you play this game as it will consume you and the time you have left for the world!",1

"best game evur 10/10 would buy again, oh wait i did!",1
"game crashed my computer intermittently; bethesda refused to even answer multiple emails sent to them about the problem. see thread on skyrimnexus for other people with the same problem. because every cave or area in the game is linked to a quest, theres little reward for exploration. its basically a loot game with a story, diablo for people who expect their game to entertain them. skyrim contains none of the features that made morrowind or oblivion shine, and with the bugs it contains and bethesdas refusal to address them, i cannot recommend it.",1
"amazing game, best rpg ive played in a long time. unfortunately bethesda dont seem to be able to make a game without it including loads of bugs which really lets this game down. the game is perfectly playable, ive finished it a couple of times and when youre bored of the game you can install mods which is a big plus :)",1
"fantastic open-world rpg. interesting world and story but combat is a bit shallow.",1
"an excellent one player game, challenging at all difficulty levels, strategy requirements are impeckable, and the art work invested in the environment is absolutely awesome.",5

"playing skyrim is like masturbating: first its good, but later you regret it. then you do it again.",1
"ridiculous game, dragons arent real. totally unrealistic and really made the game seem like a cheap mess.",1
"modded skyrim is the best rpg youll ever play. good luck setting it up, though. ive probably spent more time modding skyrim than ive spent playing it.",2
"i actually have a lot more hours on this game thats off record. but this is my goto game! with all of the mods available online, it is a really fun and immersive game!",1
"the best game ive played in a while. so fun and realistic and it has amazing graphics! i have a computer with an intel core i3, and it still has good graphics. if you like medival knights or old wizards, flame throwing spells, and alot of realistic games, then this is the right one for you. it is worth it to pay $29.99, but i would wait for the sales. payed $14.99 for this game on the winter sale 2013, but it can also go lower to $7.99 like last sale. i would get this for sure. also consider getting the tardis mod for skyrim in the steam workshop. all you do is go to the workshop on steam, go to the skyrim section and click on collections. after you clicked on collections, then scroll down the page until you find a collection option that says skyrim mods. then click on that and it will take you to a page that says skyrim mods at the top. then you scroll down until you see a mod that says tardis: time though demensions or something like that. then click on that and it and then when it takes you to that page, click on subscribe an it will automatically download the mod. the mod will automatically activate the next time you play the game. if you want to cancel the mod, then just unsubscribe. this mod is best for doctor who fans.",1
"this game is perfect masterpice the game runs well on my laptop and i have noticed that chageing the grapics settings doe increse the load time but any probles can be fixed with mods gameplay is awesome a could spent my life playing this game as there is so much contente and after playing 100 hours of it you still will not of seen everything in the game probally less than half and this game has so much lore like you chould rite 10 books about the lore in this game because there is a life time amout of lore to lrean in this game and its so good and combat is good and there is many ways to play overall awesome game and one of my favroits and a must play",1
"this game. this game. just buy it now. i promise anybody who has a sane taste in games will become hooked over time. i bought this game a couple of years ago on console and i am now happily playing it again on pc with mods and dlc. and thats another thing - mods. as if the game wasnt addictive enough, some genius decides to mod the game making it 10x better, well i salute that genius. especially the graphics mods that make it look crisp and amazing graphically, and theyre only scratching the surface of the sorts of mods you can get for this game that altogether make it unique and spectacular gameplay wise. though it may initially feel slow and a bit boring, just give it a chance and it will amaze you. with endless possibilities with character customization, dungeon looting and a flawless array of quests, your family wont be seeing you for a while after you purchase. 10/10 get it now while its on sale!",1
"heres a sword and a bow. now piss off - skyrim tutorial 9.5/10",1
"after 166 hours of gameplay, id say the game is worth having!!",1
"so glad i bought this for pc and not for a console. super duper buggy sometimes, making it impossible to get certain achievements without a second playthrough. i wouldnt mind being trapped in a room with this game for a month though - i only scratched the surface and the mods available for it are awesome, but theres other games to be played, and the occasional crashes to desktop got too far under my skin for me to keep on it.",1
"awesome game if u want a open world game that were ever u go u have a new challenge also with every person u kill u can loot them this is the game for u! i love derping aroun dfor no reson and love it when giants kill me because i go so high i feel high even though iv nerver bee high.ya.i <3 dis game! lol",1
"horrible story, horrible combat, but spice it up with a few mods and it becomes the best rpg ever!",1
"i would not have recommended this game three years ago. however the mod community, lowered price and *excellent* expansion pack content make skyrim a must-own, and not for the vanilla experience. i will stand by my opinion that oblivion was better, especilly in the uniqueness of the quests it offered as opposed to find x in cave full of draugr, and dont get me started on the bs but the combat is better in skyrim argument since the same bad combat system is just hid behind fancy execution moves. but the expansion pack content is genuinely interesting and through modding ive made my game a hardcore and fast-paced experience that feels not unlike diablo, (to clarify thats in pure intensity and not literally like a dungeon-crawler). its disappointing to have to merely say the mods make this game but thats the harsh reality in this case. the expansion content however, as ive stated twice already, is high-quality and only emphasises how mediocre the vanilla game is. edit: also i would highly recommend playing this game with a controller. the character feels more weighty to me that way, although that could be personal preference - you will have trouble playing an archer that way.",2
"even after countless hours of gameplay and lord knows how many different mods, skyrim still manages to offer more adventure and a little something new every time. this is a great game for anyone who chooses to follow the storyline first or someone like me who never does the storyline and just runs around doing everything else and killing anything you see. i love this game and i dont think i will ever actually stop playing it :d",1
"absolutely stunning. easily my favorite rpg ever. so many mods to improve graphics and gameplay (not that either are too shabby on their own), and the most in-depth character customization system ive seen. you can play anything from a wizard to an assassin. a huge open world where you can go wherever you want, and do whatever you want. skyrim is more than a game, its a mind-opening experience. seriously, get it, now. :p",1
"could see my house on the other side off the world after i got hit by a gaint 10/10 would get hit again",1
"a good game but it really should be called oblivion-lite, a very much cut down version of oblivion but with excellent graphics obviously written for game box users.",3
"after killing alduin, went out without armor and weapons, fistfighting bandits and wolves, ended up running from 2 mammoths, one giant and a dragon, after a while the mommoths and the giant disappeared, so i tried to engage the dragon in melee, oneshot by his tail 10/10 would do again, no regrets",1
"this is one of worst games ever if you dont suckk....noob",1
"an excellent addition to the tes series. despite its changes and simplifications, i think the game is more morrowind than oblivion in atmosphere, and thats a good thing.",1
"endless fun, expansive world and endless replay value! :d",1
"one of the best and largest (no kidding) rpg game ever made. ive played this game since its release (first on the ps3, then on my pc), and despite literally hundreds of hours spent in skyrim, the harsh north still manages to surprise me with something new. i have to say that its one of the few games that are actually worth their price in gaming time. but this also leads to the infamous omc (one more cave) syndrome, which can enslave you to your keyboard till unhealthy hours. its that addictive, but also that rewarding. it gives you a strong sense accomplishment each time you craft new armor or level up in magica based skill trees. and it doesnt age, as the community provides hd graphics enhancers and tons of mods (some especially creepy). i get goosebumps each time i realize that elder scrolls online are just a few months away...",1
"my personal favorite game of all time. its as addictive as skooma.",2
"has great graphics and there is endless amounts of stuff to do and to collect.",1
"not just game of the year game of the decade, there hasnt been a game this good, with as much thought and effort put into it in a very long time. buy this game and be engrossed in the rich and wonderfull world of tamriel full of everything that makes an rpg great. 10/10",1
"best rpg game of this generation, setting the standards for every rpg game made.",1
"simply amazing! buy it, rent it, do what you have to play the freakin game!!",2
"good game. vast open world. can follow the story quests or go out and do your own thing.",1
"this game is hours of fun i would deffenetly recommend it.",1
"this is the best game i have ever played 10/10 wonderful graphics its a very long game and thats very good in my oppinion i think the hole elder scrolls series is very good but this game is the best of them there`s so many opportunities in this game i love it",1
"a very mixed opinion games...sometimes its fun but most of the time it get very repetative walking around,plad quest, and uneven combat system. if your a person who likes rpgs such as fallout this is good for you,,, but if now i wouldnt recommend it unless its close to 40% off.",1
"havnt played very long on pc yet but from my experience with the xbox version i can say that it is well worth the 10. its like the game of thrones/lord of the rings game we never got.",1
"ok, just before i start, it says i only have a few hours, but i used to play it all the time atmy friends, so in total, i would have over 100 hours. this game is amazing, there are no other words to describe it. the fact that you can one minute be fighting dragons, and battling trolls with your voice, and then the next minute, be playing hide and seek with kids in a village is so cool. the open world in this game is awesome. if you cant be bothered doing the quest, thats cool, you can just walk around, meeting people in the villages, kill bandits, and even get married if you want to. you will never 100% this game, the amount of possibilitys for the quests is awesome, you can fight for, or against almost everything, and there will always be that one sidequest, for that guy in the middle of nowhere, who wants you to bring him something from the other side of the map, and you cant fast travel. overall, this is the best game i have ever played, and will remain that way for a long time 10 / 10",1
"if you like action rpgs, i highly recommend this game. it has a good story, amazing character creation, and its just plain awesome. there are so many choices and so many side quests, if you buy this game and like it, youre pretty much set for life. you can follow the main story, do your own thing, or if you have a lot of spare time, do both. i always have a hard time stopping this game when i play. this was my first review, so i hope you found it useful.",1
"bethesda games are awesome. i recommend the elder scrolls saga to all who get more crazy becouse of medication, then they were before they took that medication. believe me when i say that being hooked to bethesda games realy draws your mind away from worse addictions and/or psychiatrical problems.",2
"modded it and was in my house. i got kidnapped,  and then shrek came in and exploded them with onions. i then let him fill me with onions and went back to playing gr8 m8 i r8 8/8",1
"this game is amazing, no issues at all. you enter a cave and you fight giant creatures such as spiders. or maybe its a gang hideout and you were paid by the guard to take out the gang, and you see they have slaves, you can free them. though in the outcome of all your choices dont affect the end of the game, you can see it through the villagers eyes. they will idolize you or hate you or just plainly hear your name and attack you. and after all the amazing sceneries, fights, and dlc..... there is mods. and once you played this game to its last minute try other games like the fallout franchise or oblivion the one before skyrim. 10/10 - waffles book",1
"loads of gameplay with lots of customazation and replay value. amazing game and a must play!",2
"tried playing it again today,game crashed every single time cuz of the hiv spread 10/10 would play again if it worked",1
"if this game doesnt make a girl squirt idk what will.",1
"this is game with tons of things to explore. do what you want in a big world... and if that isnt enough, mod the heck out of it till you are satisfied.",1
"another great game by bethseda. cant wait for the next one, already beat in on console but it is 100x better on pc, 100% reccomend this game",1
"probably the best game ive played so far. everything about this game is great. really worth the money.",1
"i love skyrim! this game is amazing! i would reccomend this to anyone who loves gameplay that will last sooo long! i have like 20 ish hours and have not even started campaign on this new charecter. overall i have 60 hours i think. one thing to do if you get this game is to get graphic updates and get enhance mods for everything graphics related. also beware many many many glitchs, you will only get theese glitchs if you try to do them, so just dont do anything stupid. 9.5/10 <3",1
"story and atmosphere really draws you in but it can get repetitive at times 9/10",1
"this game is simply amazing. ive never gotten bored of it. theres so much to explore, so much to find, so many quests, and much, much more. a lot of funny things can also happen in this game, most of them werent meant to be in the game (you know what i mean, guys, glitches. but enjoyable glitches at that, if that makes any sense to you). the graphics are amazing, and they make the game look beautiful. this game is awesome, and and i recommend that you buy buy buy. hand them the money. youll never regret it. ever. 50/10 buy!",1
"great game but it bugs out a lot. prepare for things to be way out of place and somethings to not work.",3
"this game is so much more than i expected. i thought it was just going to be a game about stupid dragons but it turns out i can attack anyone i want, steal stuff, and set everything on fire! 10/10 perfect.",2
"super fun! you guys have to get it, the only thing that bothers me is that i should have waited to buy it when it went on sale! still a fun game andtotally worth the $20, plus you can mod it which adds so much more once youve completed the game!",1
"why are you looking up reviews on this game? stop reading. buy this. buy it now.",1
"so many quests... why is life so short? doing my 2nd playthrough and im actually seeing lots of new content. also, hearthfire is overwhelming. so much furniture to built...",2
"a friend of mine got me into this game a while ago and its free roaming gameplay, and general ability to craft almost anything reeled me in. then the ability to mod the game came in and i was hooked even more. with every dlc the game kept growing. even after being out for years now this game just keeps going. people love it and i know why they do. with all that people contribute to making the game more than it was released as, it has become a peoples game made by bethesda but shaped by the players into whatever vision each of us may have. it has become a huge way for so many to express ideas and share them with countless others. as a modder for this game the happiness my work and the work of so many others brings to people is priceless...and better than any amount of $.",1
"this is probably the best hentai game i have ever played. through the use of mods i have followed the adventures of wizzletug burfoot as he galantly prances across the countryside  well endowed women with tentacle spells, murdering guards on sight, and robbing children blind before using the force to end their annoying antics. i turned into a werewolf once and my  was far larger than it was as a human which was nice. 10/10 - game of the decade.",1
"esv:skyrim is amazing!! ive been playing this game for 2 years now, and its never failed to entertain me! there are so many quests, activities, and lots more to do! defeat dragons, trolls, assassins, sabre tooth cats, and much much more!! plius there are so many paths you can take to munipulate your character! you can join the assassins and theives, or you can continue your righteous quest to defeat alduin and save the world! i hope you enjoy this game! i sure do!",1
"a lot of improvements are evident in skyrim from oblivion. levelling up seems to take longer in oblivion, but the perks system on skyrim is much more interesting, though not always logical in terms of how skills progress. your journal gets pretty full on skyrim in a short time, there are tons of side-quests, the prima guide book is twice as thick as the oblivion guide, and has smaller print.. fortunately the dungeons are better designed in skyrim, always a quick way out once you clear them, rather than having to walk back the way you came. combat system is much improved with better blocking, dual-weapons and smoother attacks making fighting less frustrating than in oblivion. magic also progresses nicely, as does the weapon and armour upgrade system. enchanting and alchemy are more manageable, also.",2
"very fun and immersive, tons of quests to keep your occupied.",1

"i would recommend this game to anyone, no matter what games they enjoy. ive played this game for more than two thousand hourse on my xbox, but moved to pc for mods and because i only used my xbox to play this game and didnt like that. the best part about the game, to me, is that you can do anything you could possible do in the game. you are not restricted to certain armor, weapons, magic, shouts, places, or practically anything. with great dlcs like dawnguard, hearthfire, and dragonborn you can become a vampire lord or fight against them, make your own home and adopt children, or ride dragons and more! as well, with mods the possibilities are endless because the community will continue to make more great mods. i got it when it came out in 2011, and i still play it today. 10/10.",1

"in skyrim you can be anything. im myself a thane of four holds who assists in the investigation of a murder while at the same time an assassin-thief who robs and kills and loots peoples bodies... and bribes the authorities when caught in the act. im also a proficient blacksmith and chemist (but sadly no one remembers me for that). in my spare time, id dive deep into caves to find hidden treasures of the region, slaying trolls and wolves and those plant-men spriggans and other hideous creatures. when i feel strong enough id take a hike up the tall, snowy hills to try my luck with the dragons but theyre mostly unfriendly so i slay them instead for their bones and scales for making weapons (and money) as well as their souls for learning the powerful spells of the dragons. skyrim, however, somehow gives me a feeling of loneliness as at times it feels so quiet. even in the big cities, the people feels cold and not so merry. they give me that odd, rigid stare when i walk past them. but maybe thats just me. its a really great game, though. i dont do this game justice by this lame- passage, but really, if i had to recommend only one game to someone, itd probably be skyrim.",1

"skyrim has everything you want in a game. good visuals, good story, good combat, and a great amount of variety. this game does a great job at immersing you into this world and keeping you there. it has dragons, werewolves, magic, vampires, otherworld gods, dark elves, mystery, robots, tragedy, humor, awesome loot, and epicness. what you experience is based on how far you want to venture into this world and on top of all that, you have the steam workshop to add even more.",1
"insane amount of stuff to do. huge map so many wicked locations. started to become a bit repetitive after 40hrs of play.",1
"skyrim is a very aesthetically beautiful game. the storyline is very decent and it has a certain catch to it. since it is an open world singleplayer game you have an extremely large set of options on how you personally want to complete the game, and as far as i know there is an insane amount of side quests that will grant certain loot and gear to the player. there are two dlcs to the game that fits perfect with the default game, and it adds a lot of new items and features. the walking animations could definitely be improved, and the many side quests could have a bit more creativity to them. in general though, skyrim is a great game!",2
"this game is definitly in my top 5 of all time for greatest games. it has a wide range of different races and classes you can play. i personally enjoy being a woodelf assasin. stealth and daggers are awesome. as great of a game this is, i do see patterns with quests. *ie how the ending of faction quests will be. other then that you could spend countless hours playing and never get bored. i would say to that this game is definitly worth playing.",1

"tes v: skyrim features one if not the best role playing experience that i have ever had. the storyline itself is a bit short of 20 hours alone, but with all the side-quests and different things to attend to, it is said to have around 500 hours of gameplay. having that said, i am soon at 800 hours, and i have yet to completely finish my game. this may be due to the fantastic selection of mods that are available for this game. check out gopher on youtube on how to get into the basics of modding if youre new. and if youre wondering about purchasing this game, do it. just do it.",4
"get it on sale, beat it as fast as you can, then hope bethesda doesnt rush the next one. dlc was well crafted, more extensive than you would think, but completely failed to capture my attention or even do much that modders hadnt already done. vannilla game will provide at least 30 hours of quality entertainment before you discover the ridiculous bugs, the millionth fetch quest, and everything gets stale.",2

"awesome game, very long story, wyrmstooth mod is free and very long, and the adventuring aspect is quite good, although i wish the caves/dungeons would respawn instead of just being left desolate after i just completely destroy them.",1
"is it really necessary to review this game? everyone knows its awesome! ive played countless hours on xbox 360 and finally got it on pc just for the modding side and i am not disappointed! modding isnt painless on this game but when it works, its totally worth it! putting the modding aside, if you havent played this game on any support yet, what are you waiting for???",1
"skyrim is a large open world fantasy game. the world has a rich lore behind it and a decent sound track. the main story is decent but the real focus of this game is the exploration of the world. well worth the price even without a sale however, adding mods from the workshop and/or from skyrim nexus will convert a two week game into a many months of adventures making the game price a pitance in comparasion.",2
"my mods look more realistic than real life. - 11/10",1
"amazing, so many hours of great fun. great storylines, multitudes of quests, one of those games you will never complete.",1
"ther classes are interesting and so is the quests in the game it shines very bright even though some places might look a bit dull.",1
"i love all of the elder scrolls games but this one is the best in the series so far.",1
"you dont even rim the sky wtf bethesda failed us again",1
"do your really need to read a review, its elder scrolls for akatosh sake. this is the best game ever, until the next elderscrolls(not mmo) is made.",1
"it is awesomesssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"college got so much harder after skyrims installation. could never figure out why.",1
"awesome game, high replay value, go smack some drauger and kick some sabre cats",1
"skyrim....hm...it is not as good as i hoped it is. but dont get blinded about that, it is still a really great game. the game itself is really entertaining. you can spend hours and hours just in farming for armor or stuff like that. this game has awesome quests. a great atmosphere. a huge world and a lot of stuff to do. . the world is not colorful so often. more like a boring grey, but you have to remember : this game is full modable. and this is the amazing stuff what skyrim makes so great. that you can mod as much as you want. you can design your own skyrim. from the little flowers to the huge mountains and dragons. the fighting system is really cool, so is the stealth system. it is one of my favourite elder scrolls game besides morrowind. as an elder scrolls fan you should not even think about buying this game. just do it. no regrets, no doubt about it. 9,5/10",1
"needs a yu-gi-oh crossover but otherwise its alright",1
"truly an amazing game. if you a fan of fantasy this is a must play. also with the amount of mods available you make this our own.",1
"if you dont own this game there is something wrong with you!",1
"a whole new woooooooooooooooorld inotherwordsbuyit",1
"if you dont know who good this game is by now then you really havent been on the internet long enough.",1
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"this is an awesome game, lots to do and so much many hours of enjoyment. dragon fighting is the best and crafting your armor when you get the materials is equally fun. if you picked this up durring any of the steam sales you wont be disapointed. this game is worth the money and time.",1
"i recommend skyrim to those who are looking for a wonderful and beatufil medival, fantasy, role playing game. i also recommend skyrim for those who wish to play a major role in a large and creative modding community by creating (a variety of) mods or just using them. i have put around a thousand hours in to this game on my ps3 and mt pc so it works well on all platforms but i honestly prefer it (and most other games) on the pc. so again if youre looking for an amazing fantasy, role playing game which you would like to immerse yourself in, get skyrim.",1
"if anyone wouldnt recommend this game... their a boring person",1
"great open world game, allows you to put in a lot of your spare time without any need to grind for gear, levels or items. although the game has a lot of issues; e.g. below average combat system, magic is underpowered and strange difficulty curve. a lot of issues can be easily solved by the giant and very active modding community. a must have for people who are: - fans of openworld games - fans of the elder scrolls series - looking for a good fantasy game a recommendation for people who are: - looking for a good rpg - looking for a fun single player experience - looking for a fun game that allows you to sit back but still have fun a would not reccomend for people who: - dislike games in the rpg genre - are looking for a game that they can play in short periods - desire an rpg with a good and satisfying combat system",1
"ride a dragon, what else it is to say about the game?",1
"this game is a fun rpg open world fantasy game that you pick your class and fight of tons of things i reccomend this game to people who had fun in dota 2 but wanted it to be more open",1
"ive grown up on the elder scrolls series, and put in hundreds of hours on this game. bethesda games tend to be a little bugged and always have some game breaking mechanic (crafting trees im looking at you.), but the pc version of this game is definitely worth getting. the mods in the workshop alone, excluding nexus mods, make this game so much better than the console version. 5 out of 5 gamers would play again. such game. much good. very doge.",1
"i love the game.. definatly the best game ever created, its immersive feels like a living world in a fantasy/medival ish theme. the game is stunning and groundbreaking. the mods and mod community with their talents make this into a breathtaking experience. -naeha",3
"i spent way too much time in this game. i have no regrets.",2
"alduin isnt even attacked helgen yet, everyone is dead. got all magic spells and tons of magic, havent even left helgen. console commands = 27/10",1
"this is by far the best game ever made, it is the best rpg, the best action, the best adventure, the story line and the backline story is literally insane, and with awesome updates from the workshop this game can become anything you want, all elder scrolls games are always 100% outstanding, i sincerly suggest playing this incredible game!!",1
"one of the best game i ever bought, i usually never play single players game and this one is the only one i really play. amazing game, bethesda knows how to make you like doing quest in an rpg game.",1
"if you havent played the elder scrolls v: skyrim, you need to!",1
"worth it, if only for the epic mods. civil war story is subpar and main storyline, while epic, was a bit too short. then again, dlc has promise.",1
"this is a very realistic looking game with lots of mods, its even better with mods. not even kidding.. but the vanilla verison is fine to play. very nice graphics, sounds, etc. gameplay is amazing, best is the main quest. for all those haters go and play it some more and see how good this game this.",4
"i really enjoy this game. the aesthetics are quite pleasing to the eye and the game-play is entertaining enough to keep my add mind focused long enough to play it for a length of time. and the wife likes it as well.",1
"amazing rpg worth lots of hours of entertainment :)",2
"this is one of the most beautiful games that i have ever played, the story is highly engaging and will get you hooked at the very start. definitely many hours well spent.",1
"this game is crack. it will consume your life. you will spend hundreds of hours playing this game and still be coming back for more. easily one of the best, if not the best, game ever made. but buyer beware: your social life will disappear once you start playing this game.",1
"ive been playing elder scrolls games for a while its one of my favourate games and id recommend to anyone who wanted hours of tireless gameplay",1
"what could u possibly....what should you...what are you playing!? play this, dont be a sucka. what!> what?! what?!",1
"kick dragons and women in the nuts or dont thats your choice to make.",1
"an excellant game, 10 minutes of play and 6 hours of your life have gone!!!!!! just have to do the next quest before turning it off and then its midnight!!!!! dont start unless you have hours to kill. and dont even start me on the mods!!!",1
"skyrim is open world you have a battle of stormcloaks and impeals fightging for skyrim.whats better is it never ends you get to fight dragons also and discover land thats in skyrim.the downloadable content even has good stuff in it 10/10.litterally!",1
"an open world with so many amazing mods to chose from. yes, please. tenouttaten",1
"this is phonominal great i know a code here `playeradditem 0000000f 1000 try it!!!",1
"amazing game. endless possibilites for character design, play style, exploration, and just about anything. looks incredible, the voice acting is top notch, and od i even need to say how perfect the combat is? one of the, if not the best games ive ever played, bar none.",1
"vanilla game is cool but mods are where this game really shines and you should definetly get at least skyui.",2
"really addicting, you should check out the multiplayer mod. its really fun.",1
"i have literally sunk 1700 hours into this game. there is so much to do its insane. and now that i have it on pc, well thats probably another 1500 hours of my life into this game considering all the free content i can just put into it.",2
"this game changed my life... its a must buy for all gamers!",1
"good graphics, overall nice game. few bugs easily fixable",1
"i must first start out by saying this is one of the best games i have ever owned. i bought this game (legendary edition) for the full price at the time being $60 and i dont regret nothin. the game is even good without legendary. i played this game for 3 years and didnt get bored, very great and engaging game. the only reason i still play today is because of the mods. the mods add a whole load more content, so that adds a few extra hours of gameplay. for the price being right now, its totally worth it and i give it 9.5/10.",3
"definitely one if not the best game i have ever played. the elder scrolls v: skyrim, or as it is called in short, skyrim, offers a vast land full of opportunity, bandits, mages, warriors, and a civil war for you to pick a side and end. the world is so full of activities it is almost impossible to name them all. the story is great, the side-quests are not only individual, they are sometimes in some sort of lineup of those that are similar. even if you do run out of quests, which would take you more or less 100 hours, you can just make up your own, such as kill every giant in the game, raid a city, try to get as much bounty as you can in one place, the possibilities are very well near endless. skyrim devours your time, but its plenty worth it. i definitely recommend this game.",1
"dropped a wheel of cheese off a mountain. it hit and killed a passing guard. 11/10",1
"great game even if you finish the main quests there is still so much more gameplay to offer from small tasks to entire new questlines 10/10",1
"after many, many hours of exploring, shouting people to death, stabbing undead to make them explode, and attempting to ride dragons... i finally finished skyrim. it wasnt the most satisfying ending, but the game feels like it has multiple games within itself. i could recommend skyrim for the side plots over the main plot. also, the creation kit needs to come out already. i want my mods. and my catgirls.",1
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"an enjoyable experience worth investing hours into the game. you will get sidetracked in exploration and heaps of quests in skyrim. though from my experience you will encounter bugs and a few graphical issues but dont let that stop you from playing.",1
"i just love playing this game for hours and hours killing, stealing, hunting, grathering, crafting, exploring, leveling and adding stuff from the workshop 10/10",1
"because people actually believed my other review, im gonna make an honest review of this game just because i can. very good story, though the main questline is kinda short and you can finish it in like 8 hours. the game really shines you walk around in skyrim, where you will find lots of people that will give you awesome quests, for example the dark brotherhood questline is awesome. definetly a must buy game^^",1
"shiz son, gotta love this game, innit. fakin got the legendary edition during the winter sales, son. 10. fak yeah, what kind of fakin berk would you be if you did not get this game? a pretty fakin berk thats what kind of fakin berk youd be.",1
"i like the tes series i just wish i could play it with my elbows. finally after almost twenty years, i can.",1
"i sold my soul to the daedric lord bethesda studios. 10/10, would sell again.",2
"first time i played this game i didnt like, 2nd time played half an hour still didnt like it.but the 3rd time...oh boy the 3rd time...i tried to play it modded, added around 50 mods started it up and couldnt close it for around 4 hours, after i gave it another shot and actually discovered the story i was hooked and still i have not finished it yet. 8.5/10",1
"skyrim... skyrim... where shall i begin? overall its a beautiful game, but it feels like it has been dumbed down in ways that i find a little bit depressing. it is a great improvement from oblivion, aesthetically and has more sophisticated mechanics, but the ai seems... really bad. the children also all look the same and have a very annoying voice, towns are underpopulated and many characters are marked essential instead of existing in a true world of choices. however the game is so much effing fun! it is a gorgeous world full of possiblilities and crafting, of sweetrolls and songs and mead. of giants and dragons, and a lot of personality. i give it an 8/ 10. not a perfect game, but a fun and immersive one.",2
"my first playthrough of skyrim was on the 360, where i played the story of the game to completion. there is a reason for me saying this right off the bat. im saying it so you can understand what i mean when i say the pc experience is so much more different than the console version. and its not because of the usual suspects one considers when thinking of a pc release. sure the graphics can be set to higher quality and the game loads somewhat faster, but these are really only the most superficial differences. the major difference in skyrim on the pc and skyrim on a console is you. by that i mean the collective you, the modders and the community around popular and upcoming mods like skywind and skyblivion, all enabled by the versatility of the creation engine developed by bethesda. i cant wait to see what lies ahead for the inevitable new fallout running on this engine. this also poses a problem, that being you may find yourself spending most of your time adding and making sure mods are working and cooperating with one another, than actually playing. just try to actually play the game once in a while and smell the roses.",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is a great game with tons or lore behind its gameplay. it features deadly and beautiful weapons, dangerous and well designed armors and the most detailed world to freely explore. the storyline of skyrim is moderate, but the rediculous amount of quests will keep you playing for days. the only thing to make this game better is to incorporate a co-op or multiplayer. this could easily be done by using blizzards diablo system where monsters get stronger and drops get better based on the amount of players or player level in game. if this was added i could play this game with friends forever!",1
"i used to play skyrim on console, and it was great, but here on pc, it gets to be a totally different game with its mods, its so much cooler. this is one of many games that made me give up on consoles. totally recommend it!",1
"i killed a chicken then i gone to prison best game 11/10 :)",1
"how to skyrim: a) play game b) hit shift + ~ c) type tcl d) noclip through bethesdas  ass level design and pretend this is a good game",1
"amazing game!! the graphics, immersion, music, story, sounds, and the list goes on and on are the most realistic game ive played. im totally hooked. ive played mmorpgs for over 10 years and played them all, this is the first non-mmorpg type game ive played given im bored with the old mmorpgs out there. what can i say outside of this game is so epic im addicted to it. im not sure i can appreciate mmorpgs anymore give these realistic graphics of skyrim, holy mackeral. i play on master mode and would like to up it to legendary just to immerse me more. the ability to install mods on top of the actual game is wonderful. the people who took time to create these mods i give a huge thank you to. i cant get over the fact that everything seems to have a life of its own from the rabbit hopping in the forest and running from me, to the clouds in the sky moving in different directions based on elevation, to the immersion of the sounds and climate. heck when it snows i actually feel cold sitting in my chair and have to turn up the heat (well not really but you get it). i had to give bethesda props for creating such a beautiful story and game. thank you and i look forward to purchasing every release you do against this game. it has that total fantasy; roleplaying feeling to it. i especially love where every npc has voice. great job!",1
"one of the best games i have ever played. getting this game and not liking this is impossible. also, bears are harder to kill than dragons at level 7. 10/10",1
"this is without a doubt one of better open rpg games i have played. i first bought it for ps3 but a few years later i fixed up my old computer and one of the first games i bought was of course skyrim. and i gotta say, its alot better on pc for two reasons. the first being that you can enhance the graphics to make it look so much better. and the second, thanks for steam workshop you can input mods so much easier and make your gaming experiance alot more pleasant.",1
"if youve played previous elder scrolls games, glitches and oddities dont come as a surprise. nevertheless, skyrim comes in a year graced with multiple quality rpgs that feature tighter combat, fewer bugs, better animations, and so forth. but to be fair, none of those games are endowed with such enormity. yet the elder scrolls v: skyrim doesnt rely on sheer scope to earn its stripes. it isnt just that theres a lot to do: its that most of it is so good. whether youre slashing a dragons wings, raising the dead back to life, or experimenting at the alchemy table, skyrim performs the most spectacular of enchantments: the one that causes huge chunks of time to vanish before you know it.",1
"this is one of the best games ive ever played. if youve watched the lord of the rings or game of thrones and thought: wow, id love to live in a world like that, skyrim gives you a chance. its highly indepth but enjoyable and user friendly. ive spent outrageous amounts of time in this game on xbox and now on pc. highly recommended.",1
"completely awesome, i cant even imagine how much better the next one will be o.o",2
"everyone should at least try one of the elder scrolls games. :]",1
"much gud. very not suck. such reccomendation. bui tis gem.",1
"very immersive game. there is always something to do.",1
"great game! i dont understand why you have not bought this yet...",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the best rpg/openworld games you can play.",1
"best elder scrolls game in the series. and the whole series is really good!",1
"this game can be fun but its extremely overwhelming. open world and you can do anything you want. there are so many quests and items in the game that when you first start off you probably will be paralyzed with all the things you have to do.",1
"awesome game!! spent ~700 hours on it on the playstation. and never getting tired of it :d",1
"this game is freakin awsome it has realy good graphics good side quests like the thieves guild quest line that was the best side quests in my opinion realy good gameplay. but beware it is very adictive",1
"wonderfully detailed game. a must have for any elder scrolls fan.",3
"this is the best game ever. i cant really say much more about it, between steam and my ps3 and 360 i have about 1000 hours on this game and im still not bored.",1
"better gameplay then oblivion but with even less of the morrowind feel and complexity. the dwarves are back but no longer inspired by ancient assyrians. the game is packed but there are noticable spots where things are missing. this game is greatly inporved by mods if done correctly.",1
"vanilla is fun but mod it for a rip snortin good time",1
"if you have never played skyrim, you have never experienceed ife.",1
"forgot you couldnt look at the sun irl cause of this game now my eyes are broken 10/10",2
"its skyrim. you probably already know everything you need to know.",1
"probably one of the best games that has come out so far. my game hours can attest to the amount of playability youll find in skyrim. the graphics, the stories, characters, and gameplay reach farther than any other game i have played. i might love other games and i might spend a huge chunk of my time out of skyrim but i can always see myself coming right back when there is a break in my gaming stride which is why i would recommend this game to anyone who ask me what game they should shoot for next.",5
"very fun game if you manage to avoid the hundreds of bugs that plague this typical bethesda release (use mods). hordes of content and a huge landmass to explore, expanded further with the dlc releases and custom content. the combat is ok, nothing special but not awful. the gigantic modding community helps push this game from being good to amazing, allowing you to overhaul almost every aspect of the game to your specifications. grab the high resolution texture pack (its free) because without it, a lot of the games textures are poor quality.",2
"this game is amazing. two years later and i still play quite regularly. i love the elder scrolls.",1
"ive been playing skyrim probably a little longer than i should have, cant stop, its like a drug exept it doesnt harm you. great game, thank you bethesda.",5
"i cant stop playing this game, my friends cant stop playing this game, my wrestling coach cant stop playing this game. once you start playing this game you wont ever see the light of day again. oh and modding it will make everything better. everything is possible with mods... and i mean everything.",2
"this is the ultimate sandbox fantasy rpg. if youre looking for the biggest most epic fantasy adventure to come around in years, look no further. the story, action, music, and sheer amount of things to do will have you playing this for months, if not years to come. this is an amazing game. thank you shelly!",2
"this game has hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay. combine that with the extremely active modding community and you can play this game forever. definitely a must have game.",1
"better than a bottle of skooma on a frosty winters eve.",1
"this is definitely one of the best games i have ever played i love it everyone that has the money should buy it and give it a try see if you like it.",1
"if you some how dont have this game, you should change that",1
"considering the fact that i have over six hundred hours on this game i would have reason to believe i have experienced everything this game has to offer, that is complete bs. the community creats mods and texture packs for this game ever expanding the games content. even though the game might seem easy afer a while mod packs like skyrim redone and ace adds a level of difficulty that hardcore gamers will appreciate. so all in all this is a game that is well worth the price.",3
"skyrim is game like no other, truly amazing and very addictive",1
"the whole game went against me after i killed a chicken. a+",1
"dumbed down interface deisgned for consoles ugly graphics same engine as fallout 3 muh dragons muh dragonborn rocky bland world play obliviom instead :^)",1
"i recommend this game because it is fun to mess around with and good fun when modded so, if youre looking for a good rpg/adventure/modding/ you have found it :)",2
"a beautiful game! its definitely a must for your rpg-collection. its universe is so dynamic and living!",1
"one of the best rpgs i ever played and probably even will play. though gameplay progressed only a little bit from the elder scrolls iii: morrowind and graphics requirement may be a little bit too much, its still one of the most sophisticated, gorgerous and surprising games out there. conclusion: a true epos about brave men, beautiful women and legends about dragons, f#%* yeah! what else do you need? 5/5",1
"ahh good ol skyrim... i have spent almost 250 hours on skyrim (most hours played on console) but everytime i start a new character there is always something new to experience and watch for the first time almost as if you just purchased a new game. thats a great thing about skyrim. it sucks you into a deep and open experience filled with lots of interesting characters, landscapes, dungeons, weapons and many unique enemies to fight. bethesda really put hard work into this game and they deserve a round of applause. i love how you dont need to choose your class really. the skill trees allow you to mix and match various skills and attributes to your character which is really amazing to feel free to experiment with different skills and just overall have fun. the spells and weapons and armours in this game are astounding. there is so many items to find and spells to cast. i know skyrim has been out for a couple of years now and probably anyone reading this right now knows how truly amazing this game is. but if you havent gave it a try then you really should especially since elder scrolls online is coming out in the next following year. but anyways skyrim is truly and amazing game. i recommend it. and i know this may seem a little generic to say but this game is a masterpiece 10/10 im serious. drako signing out, peace! :d",1
"oh my god this game is amazing!!!!! seriously its open world! whats not to like?",1
"over 500 hours, yeah i love this game. played it over and over again until i could see the ebony warrior.... best fight ever!",2
"what is there to say about this game that has not already been said? its the next chapter in the elder scrolls series, after oblivion, which is said by some to be the greatest game of all time. this game i feel slightly edges out oblivion though. first off.. its purdy... the graphics totally blow away all other bethesda titles. it has an amazing story, the gameplay is top notch, and it improves on the oblivion formula greatly. if you have not played this game, go get it. you will not be disapointed.",1
"doesnt have my jar of dirt but still pretty damn good.",1
"this is prbably the best rpg i have ever played. go dovakhiins!",1
"probably one of the most breathtaking, open world rpgs i have played. wandering around in the northern land of tamriel with no loading screens is something truly extraordinary. skyrim really intrigues you to go explore every single bit of the world; everything from high, snowy mountains to deep dungeons located underground. even though the rpg elements is not something revolutionary, the game still manages to encourage you to reach the next level and unlock that new skill. plus, the dragon shouts adds a nice touch to the game. the armours and swords look, for the most part, nice and detailed. though, you will find the regular ranking of weapons in the game; an iron sword will be of better quality than a bronze sword (both swords look the same, apart from the colour). the same goes for armours. but worry not, because steam workshop has you covered on that one. go grab a copy!",1
"great on its own, am-ah-zing with mods. must-have rpg",3
"so much fun, get hearthfire dlc to make your own house and adopt childrew",1
"this game is literally the best game. if someone were to lock me in a room for the rest of my life with no contact with the outside world whatsoever, and allowed me one thing to keep with me, it would be skyrim. i wouldnt even choose a computer to play it with, just thinking about the game is enough. a freat open-world game with immersive graphics, detail beyond your imagination, and limitless potential with community made mods. if you buy one game, make it skyrim.",1
"its not a game. its an experience. nuff said, now get the game.",1
"had this game since it came out on xbox probably have well over a few thousand hours, but only recently started playing on pc but still. love this game to pieces. just when you think you had explored everything you can, suddenly a trail of bandits attack you from a new camp that always leads to treasures at the end. learning all the plot about the previous daedric princes is magnificent also, if you ever played any game by bethasda (excluding that home alone game they made, oh lord no) youll know it will be fun packed. if you love medevial/fantasy games, get it. its even on sale right now! how could you not",1
"the elder scrolls series has always accounted for the top spot. skyrim is also true.",3
"this game is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"great game.amazing storyline, with the acceptional overuse of the words arrow, knee, and dragons. i love this game and it normally works well with mods too, which is always a +1 to any game. overall, an amazing game, normally for anyone who likes fighting, medieval times, dragons, and rpgs such as fallout 3 and new vegas with an optional fps view. highly suggest getting the legendary edition though, it adds plenty of new quests and great things to do across the great world of skyrim. it is now on sale until dec. 3 with a great price.",1
"i decicded to buy a decent laptop.......then..i thought she would like a pc game. equation: asus g750jx (quad-core i7 32 gbs r.a.m. nvidia gtx 770m w/ 3gbs of r.a.m.) + the elder scrolls v sky rim lengendary edition = phenominal, visualally breathtaking. exquisite, mind-blowing, heart-pounding, enveloping, enthralling, utterly surreal, all with an exceptional story line. this is my first pc game...i have most certainly purchased a work of art congratulations to all that took part in its creation. thank you.",1
"amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing game! it was so amazing on xbox that i had to buy it on pc to play with mods and console commands. it was worth the 60 dollar price tag",1
"great game, great community; what more can be said about it that hasnt already been said!",1
"such an amazing game, only problem is no multiplay but elder scrolls online is coming out. but on a single player level it is utterly flawless!",1
"yet another open-world, rpg masterpiece from bethesda. my personal favourite game of all time, a title that any other game will find hard to claim, due to the thrilling perfection of this game from start to finish. youll never be lacking something to do in skyrim, thats for sure.",1
"skyrim is an amazing game, filled with all sorts of adventures and exploration, made by bethesda, who also made the 2006 and 2008 games of the year. the game has an absurd amount of things to do, and there are few games that encourage you to explore and participate in the world as much as this one does. many people can get their moneys worth out of this game, but its particularly tailored to those that like rpg and open world games. additionally, this game can have a large amount of bugs. even with this drawback, id recommend this game to anybody - particularly if its on sale.",2
"they removed athletics and acrobatics. ... >:c other than that, an extremely polished roleplaying experience that you cant complain about being dumbed down, because it is so insanely fun.",1
"this game is so much fun. i have played this game so much, its not even funny. i have around 100 hours on the xbox, and you can see how many i have on here. it is a great game for anyone. i highly reccomend playing it. warning highly addictive",1
"+ incredible art direction and lore + huge amount of content and quests + infinite replay value + mod community dishes out free quality content + great graphics with free official texture pack + unique skill tree system + lots of weapons and armors to choose from (or forge) + unbalanced gameplay styles (stealth > melee > magic) + a few steps back from morrowinds rolepaying depth + bethesda game = glitch fest 9/10",1
"comparing to oblivion and the fact that es:iv was awesome, skyrim can be a disappointment in many cases, but oblivion aside, its a fun game to play, great adventures, great graphics and in total a perfect rpg, you should play it, and dont forget the 3 dlcs",1
"will greatly help you. you may still experience some ctd(;crash to desktop) even after applying ssme, but it is worth for trying. without ssme, your gaming experience would be....... inferno.",2
"skyrim is a great game. you can easily get lost in the huge world that bethesda has provided. the possibilitys are endless with this game between the mods and fun console commands you will never get bored",2
"overall great game... decent quests and missions/storymode... very funy exploration... decent amount of wepons and armor.. combat is ok but can be kinda clunky and boring... overall great game besides some combat flaws...",1
"one of my favourite games. its skyrim, so its awesome.",1
"i love this game. it keeps me entertained for hours at a time. it is even better because of the steam workshop allowing you to continually add and upgrade new content. i love that you can choose your own destiny and be what ever you want. i also like the whole marriage concept. usually in a game i am afraid to do any of the marriage quests because it is a real person and you never know who you are dealing with. but this has actual characters that you can marry which makes it safe. the only thing i have found that i wish was better is the character choices. the hairstyles and war paint markings are almost the same for all the races and the colors could be more varied too. other than that this game is the best one i have played so far with or without all the add-ons.",2
"my most favorite game ever. get it. get it. get it. get it. no excuses, 11/10 must have totally worth it",2
"spent 3 times the time i actually played the game modding to make it worthwhile. 8/10",1
"awesome game!! spent ~700 hours on it on the playstation. and never getting tired of it :d",1
"this game is pretty awesom... is all bout i like... hopefully every one would play this game...",1
"one of the best open world games ive ever played. theres simply so much to do and the graphics are fantastic. there are plenty of ways to customize your character, though the inventory system could admittedly use a little work. if you enjoy games like fallout 3, then youd do well to pick this up.",1
"best game i have ever played... love it so much i have it on 360 and pc.",1
"been out for a while now but i still come back to it! if youre a fan of rpgs and havent played this one yet, pick it up. this game is worth hundreds of hours by itself, and when you add in the massive amount of mods that have been and are being created for this game, skyrim is something you will come back to. definitely worth it the price.",1
"in my oppinion possibly one of the best games of its kind, definately recomend this. bethesda out did themselves cant wait to see whats next",2
"dis gaem is fukin cash, u can kil draguns an even hav a ho. so if yu lik tite  dis is da motha fukka u need to lay down som greens. skyrim, yo.",1
"if youre looking for a great game with an extremely high replay value, even after having about 100+ hours, id reccommend this. i dont have many hours on record for steam but on the ps3 i have close to 200 hours on multiple accounts.",1
"this game could change the way you game, it could also change the entire genre...mods are king and skyrim is the high king of mods buy this and you will not regret it...",2
"skyrim - simply a masterpiece, initially there were a few bugs to work through and the odd save glitch that can be catastrophic for your game...however this doesnt manage to blemish the most epic single player rpg experience to date. graphics: from the lush waterfalls, the haunted forests of the witches to the snowy mountain peaks, its a beautiful game in its entirety. mods are also available to enhance the default graphics even further. gameplay: magic spells feel great to use, the fling back from a lightning spell when you blast an enemy is great...the summoned creatures also look great. melee/range weapons also feel great to use, as if they were the real thing. sound: voice acting is great, a huge step up from oblivions monotonous boring voices. i didnt find the main song to be as epic compared to oblivions, however that is a matter of personal taste. the rest of the ambient sounds, background music is top notch and really adds to the immersion. overall 9.5/10",1
"fundamentally, this is a classic rpg, and it will whole heartedly steal hours and hours of your life, and you wont even bat an eyelid. maybe youll be off doing a quest, along the way youre talking to people, somehow youve picked up another 3 quests, this will happen forever. god damn this game is addictive, i hate it, but i love it.",1
"its ok i guess. nothing to do once you finish the main quests though. got to marry a dark elf, adopt kids and own/build several houses while being a millionaire so its not all bad.",2
"fun game, you can run around and kill . you level your dovahkiin up, fight dragons and kill more . great with mods.",1
"tes 5: skyrim is a great part of the series, and highly moddable just like its predescessors. its a game im able to put down for a month, pick up later to find vast amounts of new content mods that change the experience all over again.",2
"fun on its own, but mod the  of it. get a beast computer just so you can mod this game; worth it.",1
"this... game... is... freaking... amazing!!! this game is 10/10 from me!!!!!!! play it now! noaw! nooooooaaaaawwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! stop readin and play it now! now! play it now before i found out where you live and come to your house and kill you. (jk)",1
"words cannot be put together to describe this game, but ill do my best. fantabulous. it is an incredibly immersive game with epic gameplay, good plot, good graphics, brilliant lore and awesome loot. should you get this? why do you not have it already? get it now!! 9.5/10",1
"good: mods. really, you buy this for the mods. good engine/visuals. bad: the gameplay is definitely dumbed down from the older games, and many questlines are very lacking. mods fix most of this. would sink endless hours with good mods.",1
"skyrim is one of those games you could play constantly for weeks, or even months and its still fun. then even after you get bored of it you can return months later, start a new adventure and have just as much fun as last time, if not more. throw mods on top of it, the game just gets even better. the open world exploration is fantastic and there is always something new to discover, its truly an adventure game and i recommend it for anyone who likes fantasy games and open world games.",2
"this game by far to say awesome would be an understatement, hundreds of side quests, an in-depth system for combat, new special steath kills not to mention combo moves, pretty much take all elder scrolls games, bung them together and then double it and you have skyrim!!",1
"purchased at $25 at 249 hours, i definitely got my moneys worth. its not as memorable as fallout 3 or new vegas, but its a technical achievement. the size and detail of everything, the sheer insane amount of stuff to do. the very refined combat and character raising systems. youll run multiple characters with no regrets. get mods though. they were what kept me playing for 200 extra hours.",1
"the right way to customize your own fantasy epic...and, yes, kill monster and grab the money!",1
"brilliant! fantastic & wonderful, to play, see and hear. it combines a lot of the best bits of bethesdas previous es and fallout games, yes it has its faults, but it there is so much, much more that is right about it, and whos to say what future patches, dlc and wonderful user made mods will bring (yeah pcs!). it truly is one of those games where you dont just play it, you live it, and youll want to every gaming hour you get! cant click this recommend button enough times...",2
"fantastic modding platform, otherwise mediocre game. the community did a great job creating the real skyrim. bethesda did a great job providing a canvas.",1
"one of the best games i have played and with the mods in steam workshop you can play it over and over several times and if you just think you may like this game get skyrim legendary edition you get all dlcs i bought skyrim in a offer and really misses the dlcs. score 101/100",1
"skyrim is amazing. although the main storyline is kinda plain there others make up for it as there is, what seems to be, an infinite amount of storylines and side quests that you can do, this really adds to the lasting appeal to the game as their is always something to do. modding is fun and can enhance the game in aspects. the ui and ai however are terrible and are always a nuisance, however there is a good ui mod that can be used. nearly every npc has voice acting and it makes you feel more immersed in the game. gameplay is solid and leveling up is great. character customization is also a brilliant part of the game 8.5/10- the ai glitches really lowered the score but the game overall is great, good storyline and a long lasting appeal",1
"sheer brilliance and totally epic, its huge and theres lots to do like morrowind but nothing compares to morrowind epicness but this comes close. some of fallouts systems would have been brilliant here such being able to solve quests without violence, the crippling effects on enemies etc would make an amazing game perfect hopefully a morrowind remake into a skyrim like engine will eventually happen :d",1

"this game has sucked up so many hours of my life. its been fun.",1
"awesome, if not the best rpg i ever played. top grafix, lots of quests, armors, npcs, stories. dont forget to mod it with nexus mods for maximum pleasure.",2
"skyrim is a game full of exploration and the thought of adventure. you never know what youre going to find next (as long as you dont look on the skyrim wiki). the graphics are fantastic, the storyline is interesting, and the game is a fun experiance overall.",1
"beautiful game, stunning mods available, all-round brilliant!",2
"solid game. ive been pretty critical of it in the past but playing the pc version changed my mind. it tends to go on sale pretty often for a fair amount off of the list price, so if you want to buy it, wait a little while.",1
"seriously? youre looking at reviews for skyrim? i suppose if you were asleep since 2012 you might not know that skyrim is a solid game and if youve never heard of an elder scrolls game you may not know thats its a massive open world rpg. much like oblivion, skyrim simplifies a lot of the rpg systems which surprisingly actually makes the game better on a whole. the real draw to skyrim right now is the plethora of steam workshop content available for free allowing you to mod the game to your hearts content. i have a 5 word recommendation if you choose to play skyrim and check out the workshop: macho man randy savage dragons.",1
"i played this game on the xbox and plan to continue. i have roughly 600+ hours of gameplay on skyrim on xbox. the good of skyrim is its diversity and freedom. you can do almost anything and everything you want your decisions and you make the best choices. free roam options are plenty and the world is big enough for months of gameplay. tons of modifications you can add to the game from either the steam workshop or nexus. 10/10 i recommend to anyone who is a big fan of rpg games",1
"literally in my top 3 of fav games of all time, with workshop support makes it easy and fun.",2
"i thought this would suck but it actually wasnt that bad. cools spells and fighting system. i wish the weapons could be easier to swap but i bet theres a mod for that somewhere.",1
"despite the serious faults in many of the game mechanics, skyrim is a triumph because what it succeeds in outweighs those flaws (which may be fixed by patches and mods) by an enormous amount. the world is the richest and most lovingly created that ive ever seen in a game, and you are completely free to explore it at your own rate, in your own way, and for a long, long time. now if youll excuse me, i have to get back to playing. despite 35 hours of exploration, and rather efficient exploration at that if i may say so, i have yet to even lay eyes on half of the world, much less explore their hidden depths. i expect to be occupied with skyrim for days and weeks to come, and look back to revisiting it years from now. a genuine modern classic.",1
"man, iwant to say get it. it is a awesome game. steam works great too. however the game itself. if you dont care about modding, just get it for console.",1
"its a very good game for people who like these open world rpgs and still pretty fun with mods today but also without mods - the story is great - great controlling your charracthers - great dlcs except heartfire because it isnt worth to buy so much for only making your own house - good side quest, deadric quests and these diffrent schools. if you like these game go and buy it i recomend go buy legendary edition because then you get all the dlcs",1
"one of the greatest rpgs ever, i cant find anything wrong with it.",1
"**i have put way more hours into this game on the x-box 360 version** one of the most immersive games i have ever played. the lore to this game is amazing, if you are willing to do a bit more research on it. i would recommend this game to anyone who likes open worlds, rpgs and fantasy medieval stuff.",1
"its skyrim. why wouldnt you get it?!? you can make it into whatever game you want with mods. the only reason not to get it is if you do not have some free time to spend in tamriel, cause you will be there a while.",2
"i definatly recomend this game. i have been playing this since i bought it, and it been one of my favorite games for a long time. i beat it 5 times on xbox 360, but yet, the dlcs where such a good way to keep the game interesting. i still play this game to this day. it is one of the best rpgs i have ever played and if you dont own this game of have never played it, buy it now!",1

"skyrim is one of those rare games you get addicted to for hours on end.. and even some of the mods are very beneficial to those that have already completed the game, if your looking for a game that has mods that arnet a game killer, fantastic storyline and dlcs amazing graphics and a beautiful combat system buy skyrim",1
"easily my favorite game of potentially all time. the main story isnt up to par with the other elder scrolls titles, but skyrims light is shown in the diverse sidequests and modding community. the graphics, even when on high, look terrible, but with the hd textures pack made by bethesda and some mods this game looks like real life. 10/10",2
"this game is brilliant, the graphics are decent in vanilla but when you install mods it looks amazing. the story is good but the ending to the main questline is a disappointing. highly recommend this game to rpg lovers, there is a few bugs from time to time but mods can fix that. overall 9/10.",4
"this game is pretty much one of the best games around, even if its not the most recent, it still has alot of things that other more modern games dont.. like the ability to do pretty much whatever you want. also it has a very cool and interesting plot/history. i dont think theres anything i dont like about it.. and if there is ... the thousands of mods around will quickly solve it.",1
"if this game was a potato it would be a good potato",1
"do not buy this game unless your computer is some sort of god beast. laggiest game on steam, only seconded by metro 2033. i try playing on low graphics and it still lags. unless the lag issue is fixed, buy this game on a console if you dont want constant lag pissin you off.",1
"i used to be vanilla like you then i took the nexus mod community to the knee. 11/10",1
"this game is absolutely fantastic. it seems like no matter how long i play i never run out of things to do, even if i complete the main story. the world is absolutely huge, the game looks nice, theres endless quests, good story, some memorable npcs, pretty good voice acting (aside from some spots here and there), and taking down dragons is a blast. i definitely have hundreds of hours of gameplay yet to get out of this. id recommend this game to anyone who has time to get into a good plot.",1
"gameplay:9 (fps and tps mode) graphic:9.5 (mods give 1 points) overall:9.25 this game with mods=epic",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",1

"as my first real dive into the rpg universe, that has been a great success! i have really enjoyed the gameplay and asthetics of this game. the moment i stepped into the world of skyrim i fell in love with the land and its culture. the community surrounding this game is phenominal as well, including the people who do amazing work in the workshop. i would highly recomend this game to anyone who wants to have a nice getaway as a nordic styled warrior for a while. it is an inspirational experience for all.",1
"ive only seen other elder scrolls games on past consoles, but never actually played them. i heard great things and bit the bullet. i was so worried about the game being too slow or not being able to keep me interested, but skyrim was a pleasant surprise. the modding and amazingly designed game really impressed me. even if you are not a fan of console to computer interfaces there is a mod to fix that! not enough items/weapons/spells? there is a mod to easily upgrade that as well. even the vanilla version is great and skyrim has created an amazing community of modders that has made the game even more worth playing.",1

"i just finished my first play-through of the game with no mods. i am a fan of the series and this one delivers. the game is very open-ended and you get what you put into it so your experiences will vary. i will compare my experience between oblivion and skyrim: gameplay- combat has been improved and leveling feels more natural. terrain feels impassible at times. the map is huge! visuals- although the visuals have improved, i think oblivion had more revolutionary graphics for its time. i also feel that oblivion with its forests was a more beautiful game and skyrim seems a bit too bleak and barren and lacks color and details sometimes. (you can probably fix this with mods) interface- has changed and it took some time to get used to the quickslots. the menus are clearly designed with a controller in mind, but it is quick and efficient to use once you get the hang of it. plot- i dont want to spoil any of the plot, but i will say that i liked the factions and how they tied to the lore. very solid plot. dragons?- yes there are dragons! yes they do get boring very quickly. overall- one of the most entertaining and replayable games you can get on the pc. i look forward to modding it and replaying the game with a different character.",1

"i enjoy the open world feel. while usually i am not one for single player games this one actually keeps everything rather fresh and new offering all kinds of things to work on and fight. the quests though can be interesting to try and complete when you do not get detailed directions. i have had to look up some of the quests now and then because the directions given in game were not in depth enough. regardless though it is a fun game.",1

"a great rpg featuring plenty of diverse places to explore and quests to do and skills to level up. honestly, im nearly 50 hours into this game and im not even close to completing the main storyline (at least i dont think so since it feels like i am still early in the story and ive never even finished the story before!). theres plenty of side quests to do, some short and others more in depth and probably shouldnt really be called side quests since they have their own story to them. these include other faction storylines or random lore that comes up with a long quest chain. its one of my top games of all time (gta san andreas on the ps2 is still my favorite of all time) for the open, endless-things-to-do world and just great presentation and production of the game. if youre into this you should definitely check out fallout 3, another one of my favorites by bethesda.",1

"only downside to this game is no multiplayer (i just want 1-4 player local co op to play with friends, not the entire community *teso*). also a linux port would have been great to have. oh skyrim... definitely one of my favorite games ive ever played. if you dont like the default fighting mechanics stop complaining and get a mod. dont like graphics? get a mod. get a mod is my answer to almost everything when someone says something about skyrim because the mods allow you to make it yours.",1
"nice game, nice history, open for mods, open world, dont need nothing more.. :d",1
"skyrim was excellent and thoroughly engrossing for the over 100 hours played. there is soooo much to do. skyrim is more of an evolution rather than revolution over oblivion. gameplay was refined and tweeked, but there wasnt anything very different. the game looks spectacular and theres plenty of mods to customize your experience. sometimes i would be out exploring and just stop to take in the incredible vistas. the end of the main quest was a bit weak. i had more fun conquering outposts for the rebels than beating the main bad guy. my horse was such a bad  i just let it run wild on the dudes defending the forts and cleaned up while they were distracted. good times. if you dig rpgs at all, i highly recommend this game without reservation. its a classic.",1
"this is awesome. dont just take my word for it, pc gamer just named it the greatest game of all time. so, its pretty good. :|",1
"by far one of the best games of all time. if you havent had a chance to play any games from the elder scroll series, i would highly reccommend this one. great graphic, great story, great combat! id give this game a 10/10. if you liked this one, go pick up morrowing or oblivion. also, make sure to get the elder scrolls online in april! :d",1

"after spending over 700 hours of my life in this game, i feel i can finally say that ive sold my soul to bethesda, once again. this was the first elder scrolls game ive ever played, it my not be my favorite, but its the one ive played the most and i still have a lot of good things to say about it. there are well over 200 quests to do and the content doesnt even stop there. pros: -huge game world -mods -detailed dungeons -good game mechanics and skill-trees -good storylines -likeable and hateable npcs -great voice acting -great main questline conclusion -great dlcs cons: -questlines were too short -minor glitchs (though i never experienced any game breaking bugs) -main boss was too easy -youll neglect your real life family/needs -the npc ai -the handholding my suggestion when playing? mod it until it crashes, fix it, then mod it again. i would recommend this game to a friend. 8.6/10",3
"this game is addictive, completely. for single player, its a great game. you can install all sorts of mods to make the game just right for you. id highly recommend this game to anyone thats played any of the elder scrolls, this one is by far the best they have put out. if you like hack and slash, magic, dragons, storylines etc, this game is for you. great gaming!",1
"exellent game played it on console but i didnt play the dlcs so when this was on offer i bought the legendary edtion with the dlcs and i just love how good skyrim is",1
"its all starts on an xbox... 3 months later the ps3 gets involved... 9 months later, i decide to get it on ym laptop because its the greatest game ever created in the historical book of gaming ever created in the universe of gaming in the know universe... i think? press play? i shoudnt have now all i can do is sit on my 600 pound butt eating cheetos and playing skyrim. i have beaton the main questline 9 times (yeah only 9) put about 19,000 hours into this game, eatin 9000 bags of cheetos and somehow managed to spend over 200$ on this game (how tho) once i started for my laptop i noticed you can mod so of course i gotta sit for another 50 hours (yes i am not even kidding) just downloading mods, now i wait to use them! now i cant decide weather to recommend this game or not...",1
"an amazing game. lots of explore and a range of paths you can take. a huge range of add ons via the steam workshop.",1
"great game before and afeter modding the sh*t outta it",1
"truly an excellent game, but dont make my mistake and absolutely buy the legendary edition. the dlc is simply worth it. and then mod the hell out of it!",1
"easily the most expansive rpg i have ever played. you could put hundreds of hours into this game and still love it!",1
"skyrim is probably the best game in this genre at this time(12/5/13) with maybe dark souls as a second. the wealth of activities is amazing and modding just adds to it. i would suggest this to anyone.",1
"love, love, love this game. not looking forward to elder scrolls mmo - hate that mmo crap.",2
"this is in my top 3 most favorite games of all-time, its just simply amazing! i love it, put 250 hrs into it, and am going to put much more. update: over 400 now!",1
"absolutely fantastic game! if you like any sort of rpg or fantasy games, youre bound to love this!",1
"i put far too many hours in on this game on 360. now im back for more due to all the great mods on pc.",1
"this game is the most beautiful open-world game ive seen! the voice actors are great, and the music fits perfectly! highly recommended for anyone whos a fan of rpgs.",1
"great game i loved it (not the puzzles ) played for hrs before the computer die may go back and finish it someday",1
"its skyrim for crrying out loud stop wasting time reading reviews on wether or not to buy, and just buy it already. a must play. and when your done, mod it. 10/10",1
"addictive and challanging. i still havent managed to finish the main quest.",2
"this is a truly awesome game. the elder scrolls skyrim is awesome with its top-notch graphics and awesome quests that are full of amazing loot and enemys you would love to murdur and eat their soul........(kidding) this game. people especially like this game because you can do what ever you want like doing that quest were you eat a priest............ when ever you want, you could be in the middle of a main quest line and wonder off and fight some dragons or trolls or raid a bandit base or go to one of the citys and buy some stuff or go out into the vast open world and do things that normal people do every day like... killing dragons, killing innocent villagers, stealing from innocent villages, fus ro da...ing villagers! theres not one thing you cant do to terrorise villagers. theres also people who actually do the main storyline but skyrim lets you do what ever you want. so to sum it all up elder scrolls skyrim is one of the best games ive ever played so you should buy it and play it to see how you like it then comment on this article and tell me your experience playing this game.... and if you dont buy it............ i will fus ro dah you b***h!",1
"the best game ive ever played. better than tf2, better than saints row, etc. instant 10/10.",1
"this game doesnt end, figuratively and literally.",1
"by far the best game that i have ever played. it keeps you busy for hours and hours. you can play it at your own pace and certainly dont feel pressured to do the quests in any certain manner. its nice to just go out hunting if i dont feel like completing quests. no matter what i set out to do in the game, i enjoy it and am able to relax.",1
"a great addition to the elder scrolls. although the user interface is horrible and console-ey, the gameplay and stories live up to the epic standard set by oblivion.",1
"fallout without guns do not buy 2/10 cant even quickscope",2
"first game i played, i accidentally killed a chicken in riverwood and then had to kill most of the towns population in self-defense. instead of becoming a heroic knight like originally planned, i become a mass murderer on the run from the law. i didnt choose the thug life, the thug life chose me. 10/10 would kill chicken again.",1
"its a ing skyrim,i dont need to say anything else really...",2
"one of those 1000 games you must play before you die",1
"never thought id play this untill steam summer sales. glad i did, immersive game and keeps one busy for quite a while. combine with the hd texture pack for a magnificent visual experience.",1
"i used to review games...until i took an arrow to the knee but seriously you will nerdgasm over this game.",2
"this game is awesome. highly reccommend to anyone that likes rpgs. 10/10",1
"a great game, with or without the dlcs. skyrim has a theme and capability that makes you want to play it repeatedly. it enhances the individuals curiousity and sense of adventure!",2
"i have played many endless hours of this game and by far i would say this is one of the best games bethesda have created. excellent game design and maps. the main storyline is especially good. great work bethesda.",2
"if it hasnt crashed yet, install more mods. thats how i play this game, yet i have spent more than half my time playing this game trying to troubleshoot it. 9/10, could have more hair options in character creator.",1
"that game seem very good, but it contain the most enormous graphic bug (repeating black flash when we moving/turning) ive tring many soluce like adding file,using enb mod,change my graphic setting and a lot more, but its impossible to have it clean (windows7,high end machine)",1
"shot a man in the face with an arrow then hid in a corner until he thought it was just his imagination. 9/10",1
"great game with so much replayablity and the mod support is awesome",1
"a great game, although the next elder scrolls game, online, is being released, this game is a fine example of bethesdas imaginative power and creativity.",1
"skyrim is amazing unless you are me. i always get a stupid double cursor whenever i launch the game and becaus eof this one thing it has made me hate skyrim with a passion.",1
"as of this writing i have spent 135 hours in skyrim... though thats excluding the probable 250 hours spent through my xbox... soo yeah... what more can i say? once the vanilla game got stale there is a whole world of mods, prolonging the game with great quests like sorcery, added dungreons, weapons, magic and the gods know what else.",3
"in my mind the game is a masterpiece, the game looks amazing, and is in my mind very well made, as for the storyline, i adore it. there are of course a few minor things in the game, for example the horses, they move very weird and they are quite slow compared to walking. the game itself is a fantastic experience with superb gameplay, beautiful graphics, and majestic music. the fun part is you can get mods installed easily on the game through the workshop on steam, its fun to mod the game with several mods and make it after your own liking. the game over all gets a 9.5 out of 10, as its a superb and amazing game with a fantastic storyline.",1
"this game is fantastic and mods make it even better.",1
"epic game ment for real adventureurs. get this game for an amazing rpg story campain if ur a man",3
"use console command caqs 11/10 expect many loading screens...",1
"i shouldnt even have to tell you all to buy this game. if you do not, for some reason, own this game, stop whatever your doing and buy this right now",1
"ive spent 300 hour sin this game on xbox and maybe 100 on pc, its still worth my money today. if you like to kill dragons and explore the big world of skyrim then this is the game for you",1
"if you want to spend 4x the time modding your game than actually playing it, this is the one.",1
"great game, it is so much more fun with all the dlcs try playing with some mods from the workshop and just have fun!",1
"skyrim at first i wasnt so sure skyrim was my type of game. ive recently started playing it.. its a long time since all my friends playes it.. then the good part is its singel player.! you really get alot out from the game. and it has given me a completly good game feeling. how you can form and create your own character in this huge inveiroment called skyrim. the fact that u slay dragons.. it makes me feel like a little hero, in my own world. i love beeing archer.. and this game really get the best out of it. nice bows and gear, and realistic view and aspect. 3rd person or 1st person ! i love this game.. for the prize you really spent your money wizely. i recommend this game a 110% :) its not multiplayer, but its a great game! and a perfect adventure.. you may think your no the kinda person whom play this typa a game. but you are :) give it a try ! :) ive never been dissapointed by this game once :) and finally the hd pack ! amazing ! but make sure your pc can handle the requirements ! :d happy gaming:)",1

"i was a late arrival to the elder scrolls franchise and this amazing game has not only brought me in, but kept me in for many hours. the modding community for this game is great, with much to choose from, from not only the steam workshop, but the skyrim nexus. with the unlimited replay value and the massive amounts of mods and add-ons for this game, its truly the game to purchase.",2
"steam thinks ive played this game for only 119 hours. thats cute.",1
"game is awesome for people who want to kill everything and explore dungeons",1
"i spent countless hours in tamriel, bethesda made a great game, even though it was not near perfect, the modding community made skyrim into one of the best rpgs in recent years, if somethings is not like you want it? mod it. if there is something that cant be modded in skyrim, try another bethesda game, someone even managed to mod fallout: nv to have working cars! without mods: 7.6 with mods: 9.1",2
"overrated and certainly overhyped, oblivion was better and it pains me to say cause the idea of dragons in it was so exciting. they say there is an unlimited amount of missions for the game, it certainly seems it cause time seems to drag while playing it.",1
"one of the better bethesda games ive played in awhile, a ton of diversity and open end game play, i love the sandbox style game play, and unlike the fallout games once youve completed the main quest you arent done, you can continue on and keep playing until you have literally exhausted every quest, and even then theres still more quests, radiant quests and quests from modders, this game has one of the larger mod communities around and by far one of the friendlest i*ve encountered.",2
"hands down amazing. the immersive gameplay is to die for, the in-game visuals are stunning, and the combat system is top-notch. the game is never the same each time you play it. this is, and always shall be, one of my favorite games.",2
"this is, out of all the edler scroll games, the best.",1
"i learned about pickpocketing and abused it until i maxed it. now all the guards are naked. 10/10",1
"skyrim is the best open world games i have ever played. killing a dragon ot completing a quest is always a great feeling. it is a social life destroyer for a reason:the storyline and gameplay are second to none. it is an experience as much as it is a game. you can be as much as a villian or hero as you want to be. 10/10",1
"when this game came out i was incredibly disappointed in how half  it felt compared to earlier elder scrolls games, and i gave it a 6/10. since then, the modding community has overhauled pretty much every aspect of this admittedly cool nation of skyrim, and with mods, this becomes an incredible and immersive experience. 10/10 (modded only! i highly recommend frostfall and realistic needs and diseases, no fast travel, among countless others.)",2
"great game with minor flaws. it will rob you of many hours of your time.",1
"not the best of the elder scrolls but very good game :o)",1
"it would be really nice if steam would let me play my game!!!!!!",1
"great game, probably the best rpg out there! tesv: online didnt succeed in becoming a good game, this however did.",1
"all i have to say is ; 366 hours played and im still not bored.",2
"you never know what happens the next. sec and the graphic is gorgeous best roleplay game in my concern. but since skyrim is so big you will see some glitches but if you see anything contact",2
"my expectations going in werent all that high, but its pretty good, you guys.",1
"honestly, this is the best 200+ hours youll spend in any video game on steam... at least until elder scrolls vi.... or fallout 4...",1
"this game takes place in the world of skyrim, you are the dragonborn with the ability to devour a dragons soul.ive spent 230 hours on this game and i enjoyed every second of it, this is one of the best games ever made. - dennis",1
"spent 1 hour running around looking for a horses skull... then spend another 2 hours looking for pages for a dead guy 11/10",2
"its a tes game. bethesda made it. what more do you need?",4
"the rpg to end all rpgs. it took me 150 hours, and 5 different characters before i got around to finishing the main storyline. there is simply so much to do, almost too much for someone used to plot-driven games like mass effect. so incredibly fun and immersive, and the graphics are second to none.",1
"a great game, a vast open world ready to be explored. right at your fingertips! a must play game.",1
"after playing over 600 hours of this game, i can not only confirm it is a great game, but that i think it may be one of the best games ever made. it has flaws, quite a large number but it is easy to overlook these flaws in the search of an experience you will never find in other games. it is unique in atmosphere, and filled with great writing, besides the typical quests youll likely find here. if you enjoy fantasy games, and exploration then elder scrolls is definitely one to look at and play.",3
"game of the year in multiple categories, and rightly so. this is, despite some annoying bugs, the definite rpg of 2011. if you liked oblivion, youll love skyrim!",1
"i tickled a dragon to death with my bare fingers 0/10 best game of the year",1
"69/420 best adventure/rpg game ive ever played and got rekt by a crab.",1
"an amazing game! the scenery is nice and the quests are fun. so many races to choose from and you can customize your character in any way you want. there is the main quest line and then all of the side quests. this is my favourite free roam game, it does it so well! you could play for hundreds of hours and still not have completed all of the quests. also, if you get the dlc that adds even more quests! the only problem is that there is the occasional glitch, some can be minor, and some major. but overall, this is an amazing game that you should buy! 9.5/10",1
"lets see, skyrim; what can i say for a review about that game called skyrim... well, now looking on it, i feel my situation explains it pretty well: as i write this, the time is 2:30 am 2 days after i got it; and i already have 12 hours on this. and as i explore the world and view its life in every corner, i know i have only scratched the surface on the game. what can i say; i love the arnold schwarzenaeger voice for the guards.",1
"where to even f**king begin with skyrim bought it on 360, mehh wasnt fussed but for some reason on pc its my fav game. i literaly cant stop playing anyone who wants a good game or just something to mess about on, buy it must have for gamers every where!!!!!!",1
"im a bit late to the party, but this is just an amazing game. actually, its more of a virtual world, populated with people, characters, and creatures of all types. theres always something to do, and the variety is nearly endless. i still havent tapped all the potential of vanilla, so im looking forward to some of the dlc down the road. cant go wrong with this one.",1
"if you like medieval fantasy rpg then this game is something for you. it is one of my favorite games of all time and in my opinion bethesdas best.",1
"so fun, so open, i have put well over 200 hours into this on console. yeah, thats right, i enjoyed this on both systems, its great, console or pc.",1
"not played overly much. more noteworthy because of the effort you have to go to to make this game look like its meant to, rather than looking like a console port (its that obvious). the workshop goes some way to resolving this, but is limited by the filesizes, meaning many of the good mods are not obtainable through the workshop. use your preferred search engine and check for mods to improve performance, graphics and realism.",1
"10/10. get. it. nnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"its skyrim, an elder scrolls game with modern visuals great modding tools and a ton of content, there is no way to go wrong with the game. you can have fun here whether youre an action fan, or if role playing is more your style this game was made for you! it is all the elder scrolls goodness wrapped up into one neat modern package and it would be a shame if you didnt at least try it! also getting to play the game again after running through it on xbox was just a treat so even if you think youve already seen all there is to see, you havent.",1
"dragons, you can kill or tame them if you have dragonborn dlc. epic game that can easily get adicted to. you can play for 100 hours and still find new stuff",1
"if you use windows 8 there is a glitch with esberns voice and he doesnt speak which in turn doesnt allow you to progress through the main storyline...this is dissapointing because this otherwise is an amazing game...",1
"great game, very immersive, lots of things to do. do yourself a favor and avoid the actually storyline, though.",1
"great game for anyone who loves rpg and action games, for anyone who likes killing monsters and dragons and for anyone who knows to appreciate a good story. the graphics are great, tho there are alot of glitches with it (which somtimes makes the game more funny). the only 2 problems i have with the game are- 1) the menu in-game is built for consoles- but it doesnt really matter. 2)once you start playing the story you cant stop-not because the game doesnt allow you to, because its too damm addicting! (be warned)",1
"this is best game what i have ever seen. in this game you can do whatever you want",1
"well first of all i gotta say skyrim is just one badass game i like the downloadable content pretty awesome but i wish there could be a bit more killable characters",1
"i used to play oblivion till i took an arrow to the knee",2
"what can i say. super addicting. totally my type of game.",2
"i spawned exactly 582 sweetrolls, then yelled at them until they spontaneously combusted. 10 / 10",1
"it is simply, one of the best games i have ever played. please dont be put off by my short play time as i cannot play skyrim on my pc because its very old, but i play all the time on my xbox 360 :)",1
"way too hyped up for what it was. its ok for a time sinker but its just the same  over and over. dungens are copy and pasted and quest were boring as .",1
"i used to have a life... a long time ago. then i took an arrow to the... well, you know.",1
"great gme overall, great side quests that are kind of more interesting than the main story and good looks will make you want to skyrim all day.... fus ro da",1
"a timeless classic. deep political and historial set up with fascinating lore. fun gameplay and the best mods steam has to offer.",1
"never bored when i play this, but then again, this game never gives me a chance to be bored. with the amount of stuff, i wonder why you need mods.",2
"i have about 1000 hours in this game. its safe to say its my favorite game. over 100 mods installed to enhance it of course.",5
"best game evah must play for all of dos medival/magic time players",1
"this game is so immersive, you forget to eat, sleep and make friends.... because youre busy eating, sleeping and making friends. lets be honest here:",4
"holy , what is this? forged in gods very flames. do mine eyes tell me lies, a new elder scrolls game? time is nigh, i must fly, venture forth on my quest. goodbye ma, goodbye pa and goodbye girlfriends breasts. ill be off azeroth, catch you later hyrule. ill be gone albion, im no longer your fool. other crap filled the gap while i waited to begin... the adventure of my life in the land of skyrim!",2
"epic storyline. endless exploration. extraordinary graphi.... ah hell no, i aint getting near that spider... *turns off game*. 100 bottles of ortho bug spray out of 10.",1
"wonderful game, if a bit buggy and filled plot farts. on the plus, its fun and gives a sense of thrill to adventure out into the open world, fight monsters, get treasure, the choice help people or hurt them... its quite the experience and i always enjoy every minute i put into this game. on the down side, underdeveloped plot in some areas, especially in side quests, left me wanting more out of it all. the textures can be blotchy at best sometimes, and sometimes the game is just downright broken. despite the major hurdles -which we all know most elder scrolls games are fixer uppers in the end- its still an amazing adventure, and being a es fan since morrowind, i am proud to say this game is worth your time and money. ive spent hundreds of hours on the xbox360 verison. c:",1
"the elder scrolls is one of my favorite rpg series and skyrim is no disappointment. an open ended world, great voice acting, deep character customization, solid gameplay mechanics and the freedom to pursue the kind of character you want to play make this a choice game for any fans of action rpgs and there has always been a great community surrounding the series with talented modders who take the game to a completely different level, creating a deeply replayable experience.",3
"great game, i have loved it since it first came out and you can have a lil mess around and also mess around with the dlcs",1
"find that you just have too much time on your hands? buy this game and youll never have that problem again. ever!!",1
"at least every person ive known has heard about this game; in fact, i dont think theres but a single person that doesnt know about it. its a visceral rpg experience, with interesting questlines and gameplay mechanics, simply put.",2
"how could anyone not love skyrim? with mods abound to customize your game, its a game that keeps on giving long after you get into it. i absolutely love this game, and if i wasnt running on a very weak computer id probably never stop playing it and modding it. i suggest skyrim to anyone who has never played it, or even playing it on pc vs console (the modding capabilities to change the way your game looks and plays are so much better than console -- take it from someone who first played skyrim on her xbox.) absolutely well worth the money and an excellent game that you cannot put down.",2
"very addicting, its pretty much like living a second, more interesting life.",1
"get this game!!! i have invested many hours in the game on the ps3, and got it on pc to check out the mods. with or without those mods, you will play this game with immense enjoyment.",1
"excellent game that is very playable and very deep in content.",1
"the elder scrolls v skyrim is a diverse game that makes a brilliant single player rpg and makes a person with aracnaphobia like me play 90+ hours of it and it is worth it being a game of the year",1
"the old rolled papers the fifth: sky in dis game. you smel stufs and things",1
"i personally think this is one of the best open world games ive played so far, aside from oblivion and morrowind. skyrim, to me, seems to be a watered down version of an elder scrolls game, but with much better graphics of course. its fit more for console gamers, but this is still an awesome game, i actually like playing this game with a controller to be honest. if you want a more in depht, complicated elder scrolls game, buy oblivion or morrowind. i also like the fact that this game has a steam workshop where you can download mods for your game to alter your experience, whether itd be graphics, new hair styles, weapons, quests, just about anything you want to add to your game. definitely a must have if youre a fan of open world fantasy games that let you do or go wherever you wish.",1
"dragons! magic! easy combat! a sense of getting stuff done! skyrim!",1
"i like how open it is and how there are so many things to do. you dont have to stay and go down one path, you can choose to do almost anything you want.",1
"well the first time i played skyrim was way back in 2011, about 2 weeks before my year 12 exams. but furtunatly for me i was able to show some restraint and managed to fit some time in to study. the first thing i noticed when i started playing was how far the graphics has stepped up from the 2 previous games morrowind and oblivion. after several hours of gameplay, the changes to the leveling sistem, as well as the more divers fighting styles and smoother gameplay, skyrim started to grow on me. so i would defenatly recomentd it to other players :)",1
"addictive took me a while to get into it though, if you havent played it do yourself a favor and do more than the first few missions because they are really boring, one you get started you will want to play this game all day every day",1
"quite possibly my favorite game on my games list, a fantastic addition to any gamer, it adds strategy and a thought process into everything you do. tons of items, areas to explore, and dungeons this game is fantastic. mods merely enhance the game play, the default game is more than entertaining enough with at least 100 hours of gameplay. 9.5/10.",1
"one of the funnest game of all time thanks to the modding community the game on consoles gets a 7.5/10 but pc gets 9/10 its wonderful to have this game on pc get this now",1

"easily one of my favorite games ever made. heres some points. -very detailed work on the many storylines involved in the game. (not just the main story) -the dragons have an entire language you can learn. -great modding community. -shouting at people can kill. -killing chickens makes you public enemy #1",1

"great game with amazing mechanics. the dlc prices are a bit broken though.",1
"dragon born character is so over powered it is not even woth buying this game !!! had to use walk-through on internet to build the house, it is not possible to work out steps from game. storyline is confusing. use soul gems to power your weapons. too much running from point-to-point.",1
"such an amazing game even just with the vanilla version, however with mods on pc the options are endless!!! even at full price this game is well worth the money, but on sale this is a no brainer to buy. also very much worth it to check out the dlc.",5
"love this game, probably my favorite game of all time.",1
"by far the best single player game i have ever played, unlitmed amount of things you can do, ill never get bored.",1
"easily one of the greatest of all time and it really does deserve all of the rage it has been getting. not many games can turn out to be almost 3 years old and still be one of the top played games on stream.",1
"there are no words to describe this, amazing does not do this title justice. only when elder scrolls vi comes out, will it maybe be topped.",1
"one of best and fun elder scrolls games. what else can i say that hasnt already been said? buy it, its worth every penny.",4
"in grand theft auto, you can hold up entire shops with a gun. in skyrim, you can put a bucket on the shopowners head and steal all of his belongings... 10/10 ign",1

"the best fantasy singleplayergame i ever played! and with graphic mods is the graphic so awesome. love it and it makes a lot of fun.",1
"seriously if you dont own & love this you need immediate professional help. consult youre nearest medical centre and get your pulse checked for any sign of life. if you have one, youve probably not played skyrim.",2
"ever wanted to be a mage? warrior? thief? or just a mix of them all? well, with skyrim you can, skyrim is a typical bethesda game, where you get to create your own character using the games many customization features, youll then be able to play the game however you want in an almost limit less world filled with skeletons, zombies, wizards and other kinds of monsters. once youve completed the main game youll be able to add more quests, followers, houses, overhauls, pets, textures, weapons, armor and so much more via some of the many mods that the community creates. skyrim is an amazing singleplayer rpg, with endless possiblitys because of the amout of mods created by the awesome community.",1
"i owned this game on the ps3, but it was stolen. i didnt pick it up until the fall sale and i really made a mistake waiting as long as i did. i didnt play the game for at least a year and i was sucked back into the beautiful world that only elder scrolls can do. the map is absolutely gigantic. the combat in the game is great, but doesnt match the difficulty of morrowind. thats okay for me because you do run into some challenges. the quests are great. i find it difficult to follow the main story because there is so much other stuff to do. overall the game is absolutely amazing and would recommend it to anyone!",1
"ages ago, somebody i knew got skyrim, and i thought it was brilliant. my friends talked about it at school, and when i got steam, this was one of the first games i got. i still think its as brilliant as it was when i first saw it!",1
"as good as taking an arrow to the . did i get it right?",1
"bought this game on xbox 360. i couldnt resist buying on pc as well. i feel that if a game is good enough for me to buy it twice, it should probably get some recognition.",1
"if youre not playing skyrim or any other elder scrolls games and you like rpgs... youre doing it wrong. :)",1
"one of the best games ive ever played - with one caveat: you need mods. the mods for this game are amazing & add so much! deadly dragons, skyui, skse, ufo & so many more. they change the game from good to truly outstanding.",1
"mojangs skyrim is the best in the series. thanks notch, for all you do,",1
"im not too big into rpgs and fantay game but i would highly recommand this game to anyone who enjoys a long journey along with a title with a lot of replay value. the world of skyrim is massive while each chracter encountered has their own story to tell. the combat system is simple and i rarley use the magic (sorry im a noob in this genre). to be honest i got into this game after binge watching game of thrones and a friend suggested, i was right to listen to him.",1
"its an awesome game, long quests, great value. ing get it",1
"you know you played too long when your mom enters the room and you make your game character look to the door. 10/10 the radiant ai bethesda developed for their games makes skyrim really immersive making you feel like you were part of the game. npcs react to the environment and to the player in a very dynamic way. there are 95 random encounters you can find travelling from a city to another and they always fill the lore, some even get a small backstory, thats why i decided to not use the fast travel option and always go walking; the beautiful landscape will definitely make most people do this as well.",1
"epic fantasy reborn the next chapter in the highly anticipated elder scrolls saga arrives from the makers of the 2006 and 2008 games of the year, bethesda game studios. skyrim reimagines and revolutionizes the open-world fantasy epic, bringing to life a complete virtual world open for you to explore any way you choose.",1
"i dont have anything to say that hasnt already been said. this game is absolutely fantastic. if i could only buy one game a decade, it would be skyrim... and i would be perfectly happy playing it for the next 10 years!",1
"beautiful, immersive, a large world, allows personal play styles, and offers hours and hours of fun. plus buy it on pc and you get access to mods, which can make the game even better. seriously why dont you own this game yet go get it.",2
"this game is definitely in my top 5 games that ive ever played. it can get a little repetitive once youve clocked up as many hours as i have (only the online 1s show) but i still enjoy it.",1
"actually, best rpg ryo singleplayer game ever. buy it",1
"masterpiece!!!it is a world that you enter and do not want to leave.i just wish they would have kept adding more expantions to it.its too bad they stopped and moved on to other projects.they didnt keep this going as well.would have been amazing to keep seeing the story grow stronger.but there is mod work that is rather great as well.all i can say is get some snacks,turn off the lights,sit back,and enjoy a massive world filled with beautiful sights,lore,magic,mysteries,enemys,and friends.but most of all the dragons!",2
"skyrim. years later and many charaters later, i still play this great game. sure the story is boring, and the two primary quest structures are terrible. sure the dialouge isnt very good. sure there were numorus glitches. its still a great, open-world game. i still throughly enjoy clearing out dungeons, killing monsters, stealing money, helping the common folk, bare knuckle brawling in pubs, and the tons of other activities this game has to offer. every new character is an adventure, and many times ill find something new about the game, even after so many years. i highly recommend this game. this is a truely great game.",1
"amazing detail graphically and back story. a must play.",1
"this game is fantastic! the world seems endless. the complexity of the character items are great. the graphics brilliant. the only negative think i can say about it is the dungeons could be a little more complex as the 1st cave you enter is the same as the 100th. however that being said this game is as close to perfect as i have ever played. if you are looking for a fantasy rpg then look no futher!",1
"i have loved this game ever since i started playing it with my friend on the x-box 360 in 2012 we would stay up all night playing it on his big flatscreen sitting on his bed switching every 10 minutes or so. then i bought it myself for xbox as well and played the absolute  out of it i must have had a good 300 hrs on record then i got sort of bored having completed the main quest line and other quest lines a few times so i sold it at gamestop (those s as usual gave me a hardy 10 bucks yay) anyway i didnt really think about it until i later got really into steam through my other friend who really loves tf2 and i saw skyrim in my friends account i was stupid and had no idea it was on pc and he told me i should get it so i did then i slowly became sucked in to the modding community steam workshop mods then nexus now im beggining to make my own. this game without mods is fun however with mods it is arguably the best game i have ever played! overall: 8.5/10 (no mods) overall: 9.5/10 (w/ mods) only because it does get boring after playing for a week straight however totally worth the money!",1
"i recommend this game to adventerous people whom are willing to take time to go through it",2
"do it. honestly, what are you doing if you do not have this game already? buy it. this is the game that keeps on giving! 6 stars out of 5.",3
"objectively, every single thing this game does is only done halfway or less. you can find better equivalents for most of the things this game has. however, the sheer scale of the things this game has to offer is unparalleled. this is a game that uses overwhelming scale to blind players to its equally overwhelming mediocrity. that said, elder scrolls excels at making the mediocre seem fun, so if fun is what you want, you will find some fun in this game.",1
"absolutely terrible cabbage collection simulator do not buy unless you are a 100% true and dedicated cabbage collector who seeks an eclectic knowledge base of all things cabbage",1
"if you dont already own this, it had better be because someone is buying it for you for christmas. this is the best rpg ive played, even with its bugs",1
"skyrim is the best around, and nothing is ever going to keep it down.",1
"dragons trying to speak to you with a torrent of fire and ice, adventurers getting shot in the knee with arrows, criminals chased down for killing a chicken, merchants willing to buy 100 of the same  over and over again, guards who lose sight of you the moment you do a squat, citizens and nobles who never noticed you stole the clothes they were wearing, and a guy in whiterun obsessed with the cloud district. 10/10.",1
"killed a chicken, the entire village starts to fight me and then killed me! best game ever 10/10!",1
"didnt play oblivion (blasphemy) before i played this but i did play fallout3 for me it was fallout 3 with dragons and i loved it (max youre an idiot for hating this)",1
"i feel its unfair for people like me that want to play a game-buy it at a cost over 50 bucks ,,only to find out later you have to purchase dlc expansion packs to complete the game. very disappointed here ,,yes i am.",3
"the epic atmosphere that wraps this chapter of the tes saga is stunning, allowing the player to dive into a magic world on the edge of a crysis felt never before. the gameplay is quite simplified compared to the previous chapters, nonetheless it still gives a special insight into the fantastic lore of the elder scrolls. 10/10",2
"if you like the other fallout games and like the since of adventure...........get this game!!",1
"great game, so many things to do to where its hard to get bored. great views and amazing graphics. no one should be dissapointed",1
"only about 8 hours in and jsut finished doing that shouting stuff for the monks. its a good game, tremendous world, absolutely astonishing scenery, but the story hasnt really grabbed me yet. dragon age: origins story had me dying to get back to my comp every night, but maybe skyrims just takes a little bit to get going. still, very fun and 13 bucks for the game and all its dlc was a steal. looking forward to re-writing this when im 200 hours in (and hopefully a werewolf, that looks so fun).",1
"the best open world rpg to date, it manages to surpass even the highly acclaimend tes iii morrowind with its depth in gameplay and how the world of skyrim reacts to the player and its actions. if you like any game in the tes series or open world rpgs in general you owe to yourself to play this game.",1
"ill be honest: i have never played another elder scrolls game in my life, but i got to say, that this game certainly makes me want to. the world is huge, the quests are fun, whether youre diving into forgotten ruins to stop cultists from calling long-dead spirits, or just delivering a letter, it will have you hooked from the beginning, to the end. even when you take an arrow to the knee, or someone steals your sweat roll, you will have a great time playing the elder scrolls v: skyrim.",1
"a thoroughly immersive, gigantic and - most importantly - fun game to get lost in for ages and ages. skyrim delivers an absolutely stunning opportunity to build your own story, tailored to your own wishes. on top of that, modding capabilities ensure free long-lasting and highly individual enjoyment.",1
"few games will ever compare to how immersive and deep this game is.",1
"enormous, detailed and living. simply one of the best games ive ever played.",2
"the most anticipated rpg-game of the year. now you can go dragonborning all over skyrim! ...... dragonborning, its a word. look it up, kids!",2
"full of adventures, beatiful skies and landscape, the mod capability is just soo great, the quests are epic and the overall experience with this game is just awesome 9/10 there were some broken quests but that doesnt really matter because i fixed them all, thats why i gave this game a 9/10",1
"buy this game. get the legendary edition! the mods for this game are insane. this is easily the funnest game ever with correct modding. i love it. night and day difference between modded skyrim and vanilla. not to mention the unoffical patches fix so many bugs, its such a smooth experience. learn to clean your files, etc, its just so much more enjoyable. probably one of the best looking games i have now. learn more at the link.",1
"awesome game, i really dont think i need to tell everyone how good it is. let me tell you, everything good about this game that you have heard is correct, i have wasted so much time on this game, and you know, i am totally okay with it",2
"you already know everything i could telly ou about this game, but you should get it if you dont already have it.",1
"awsome game by far and the best elders scrolls game!!",1
"this game has to be one of the best elder scrolls there is. although none will ever amount to morrowind, daggerfall, etc. its still a great game to play if you love rpgs and there is a great modding community 8/10",1
"this is a elderscrolls game. skyrim will always have a place in my best rpg games of all time list no matter what. with the vanilla game alone its great but when you add mods to it... well now its amazing. the story is unique and fresh compared to other rpgs that i have played in the past year or so. i wont say that this game takes the cake in rpg greatness but its definatly one of the candles. :) 9/10",1
"uses amaterasu in titan form to kill alduin 11/10 would keep playing",1
"i mean, come on, dragons, in an elder scrolls game. mods, mods, mods, mods and more mods, it makes the game even more enjoyable",2
"in my opinion skyrim is a must have game. it is an open world game with may different ways to go about doing things. my only reget about it is it has only 1 ending and result. overall great game.",1
"best game i have ever played, so much ime spend in skyrim and with mods i am still here",1
"pretty amazing game to be completely honest with you. i loved everything about this game from story like to combat and even the crafting system. i feel this is the best es so far and i wait for the next one!",5
"its like fallout but with magic, more epic environments and landscapes, improved graphics, amazing soundtracks, huge world to explore, etc. fallout is epic as well, but this game goes beyond that. everything that is good, this game has it!! except for the freaking spiders which has become a nightmare for me. yes, im arachnophobic. i know that there are mods to replace it but im a bit lazy at the moment. :| my rating: 10/10",1
"this is a game that i may have not played much on my pc but i played it endlesly before i had my pc on the xbox 360. at points i was addicted to this classic game of briliance and if more games could be modeled of off the freedom this game has life would be amazing!",1
"i simply love this game. i bought it about two years back on my birthday for my xbox for 10 dollars at gamestop. this was the first rpg type game i ever played and enjoyed it immensly. but, just a few monthes ago i started to switch over to the p.c. to give it a chance. the first gamei bought was this and when i found out about console commands (just use them for fun) i figured out this game has it all. great story, combat, and the graphics are absotuley stunning. and the fact that i could get mods to addon to the already massive world i just got happy. overall i reccomend this to anyone that loves a strong rpg and loves tes series.",1
"this is an amazing game i recommend it to all players",1
"skyrim is a great game........a really great game......",1
"amazing game worth the money and time spent setting up the mods you want =)",1
"this game is just amazing. ive played it so much, but still not enough. not only is this game extremley immersive, it also has endless replayability. every single character will be different, i can guarentee you that. but for those days that you do get bored while playing the game, you can browse the workshop and websites for mods to inhance your skyrim expirience! i suggest to anyone that does not own this game to buy it right now.",3
"i found out how to use the developer console. instant knife kills/10 i found out how mods work sanic/10",1
"skyrim is an amazing, open world, fantasy rpg that i have wasted many hours on at this point. the game is very enjoyable with a decent storyline, numerous side quests, fairly good graphics even by todays standards, and fun gameplay that will have you stuck on your pc for hours on end. compared to other elder scrolls games it is much better than oblivion, but i dont consider it to be as good as morrowind (though that may be just nolstalgia speaking). if you buy this game i highly recommend the use of mods because after your first playthrough, the game may seem boring and repetative. also, the steam workshop make modding this game very easy even if you have never modded a game before. all in all, skyrim is a great game, mods or no mods, and i would highly recommend it to any gamer. without mods: 8.5/10 with mods: 10/10",2
"dont look directly at the bugs and youll see another great elder scrolls game. this time around the characters dont look as ugly as they did in oblivion and gameplay is trimmed down but more streamlined. hardcore rpg players wont be happy with the lack of stat whoring but youre probably gonna be too busy killing dragons and getting lost in the snowy mountains to care.",2
"they told me i cant get a divorce, so i sacrificed my follower wife to boethiah 10/10 would sacrifice again.",1
"ive lost my family, friends, work. this game took over my life... and i love it",1
"best game in the world. i love it. anyone who reads this should get it on computer.",1
"amazing game played it for hours then started modding. there is alot to do as you get alot of quests and there are alot of dungeons and caverns scattered around the world.this is the best looking elderscrolls game to date and there are a whole lot of mods to improve it. i have to admt though that after a while the game does get boring after doing alot of the quests so i suggest to move to modding the game.",2
"this game is one of the best games i have ever played!",1
"gameplay: its classic tes gameplay, search, explore, kill with swords, magic and bows or a mixture. character builds are gone; just use the skill to level it up. dragons are powerful and epic and combat is, again not the best but classic tes. there must be close to 1000 or in todds words infinity quests for the player to do, he right you know too :) story: predictable but gripping and fun all the way. the main story has gotten rid of tedious missions and left only the raw and great missions. that said though it still look me 26 hours to complete the main storyline over 3 days and im not even close to the surface of the game. graphics: tes has not boasted about the graphics but on ultra high i was admiring the detail in every nook and cranny of the game, characters look realistic, everything just looks amazing!. easily in the top 5 best looking games ever. the game does suffer from a few bugs but a small price to pay. almost picture perfect 9.8/10 :d - dean buy this game, goty",2
"this game will give you entertainment for countless hours. this is one of the least linear games that i have ever seen. there are plenty of quests for you to venture out on, and lots of customization options for your playstyle. you can be a knife-wielding assassin-type, a spellsword warrior, a wizardy mage, or even a vampire (dawnguard dlc) or a werewolf. skyrim is a vast land with an ongoing civil war, and if you choose a side in it you can lead it to victory. it is one of my favorite games of all time. pick it up if you can.",1
"ooooh there once was a hero named ragnar the red who came riding to whiterun from ole rorikstead! and the braggart did swagger and brandish his blade as he told of bold battles and gold he had made! but then he went quiet, did ragnar the red when he met the shield-maiden matilda who said; oh, you talk and you lie and you drink all our mead now i think that its time that you lie down and bleed and so then came clashing and slashing of steel as the brave lass matilda charged in full of zeal! and the braggart named ragnar was boastful no mooore... when his ugly red head rolled around on the floor!",1
"it seems long ago now, looking back, when this game was first released. i had played morrowind, i have played oblivion, loved both, and i was left eagerly awaiting skyrim. and i was not disappointed. bethesda again reminds me of what true quality is. in short, this game is amazing. but more that that, it gives everyone who would give it a chance, everyone that would allow themselves to gently fall into its landscape, a fantastical escape from the occasional blandness of life. we all need escapes, time away from the coffee and the concrete, and skyrim provides a window. its not a replacement for anything, its merely an avenue to get lost in your own imagination. those who cant let go, cant dream of fantasy, should avoid skyrim. for everyone else, i high recommend you give this game a try and give yourself a chance to get lost in its wonder.",1
"without a doubt one of the best games i have ever played",1
"really fun. free roam, mods, and so many iteemss! :3 and a huge place to travel!!!",1
"ressurected a dead chicken to fight by my side. 11/10",1
"im gonna be honest here, i really wanted to like skyrim, i did... and i dont know if it was cause of all the hype behind it but i ended up being dissapointed, the world felt empty to me and just downright uninspired... i tried modding it to make it better but it didnt change the fact that the core just didnt fell like much fun. i even loved oblivion, but oh well, i guess i got spoilt by witcher 2 being a much greater game.",1
"i modded mine to , its now an open world zelda game",1
"good bye social life, the best rpg i have played. notice that the game can be even better if you install some mods made by the community, either from nexus or steam.",1
"the most epic game ever thats what i say but its only my opinion. for 3 years of my life this game has kept me from leaving my cave wich is now how my friends call my room. i have easily spent over 2500 hours on this game and im still not tired of it. well, back to the actual review. besides the awesome main quest and its side quests, the beautifully designed landscape of skyrim and its multiple enbs (graphical mods) and the incredible inmersion it provides. this game is very fun to play. from puzzles to dungeons to conquering cities this game has a little bit of everything. every player has his unique play style. well, skyrim has this covered. from a full heavy armor nord to a sneaky wood elf or even a master high elf mage it is easy at first to choose what you prefer the first quest will give you te equipment needed to start either of these but dont worry, these choices arent permanent, skyrims skill system gives you the oportunity to master one of these and/or do a little of everything. the modding community is flourishing and rather friendly until now ive only played vainilla tes v but im looking foward to explore this vast modding community. it is hard to rate such a vast game but to my opinion this has a 10 out of 10. p.d.: remember! this is a role play game. if you dont fancy this kind of game but want to try it is a great start.",1
"excellent game. hopefully waiting for the new release: the elder scrolls vi: tamriel, or something like this, with some lan multiplayer features (why to have just a npc follower, when you can have your real friends and companions playing alongside you?)",1
"really fun with action and adventure get thousands of items and very very fun game with dragons and monsters and of course people",1
"accidently shouted at a chichen,got arrested for it,broke out of prison and escaped.now i play as wanted criminal never being able to enter a town. 10/10",1
"hell of a lot of fun. hours of gameplay and if you run out of things to do you can look on the workshop for mods extending the life of the game",1
"skyrim. its an elder scrolls game, which means youre going to have a huge world to explore again and that really is the main feature of the base game. the combat system, if you want to call it that, is unimpressive and magic feels more limited than it did in previous elder scrolls installments and the main storyline is acceptable but not great by any standards. however what bethesda did do right is the creation of the world all this happens in. dungeons and ruins are more varied compared to what they were like in oblivion and the outside world is huge in its own right and allows for days worth of exploration. so despite its flaws id strongly recommend this game. there is however a lot of snow. you probably should be looking at an other title if you have a phobia for snow.",3
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim comes with the same minor, but frequent glitches that players of the previous the elder scrolls games have seen, but those cons can certainly negligible with the overall experience it provides. the sheer beauty and design of the world sucks the player in, and truly grants the feeling of being part of skyrim. the music is fantastic, and the combat and animations are better than ever. the near complete freedom of exploring easily gives a really lengthy playtime, and surely is worth the price of the game, if not more. the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of the few games that i actually look forward to dlcs and wish to see what more the world of skyrim can offer. hunting dragons have never been as epic.",2
"love the graphics, the voice acting, the side quests, the combat mechanics, the dungeons, the caves, the creatures and animals and mammoths and giants, the songs sung by npcs, the crafting, the chicken hunting, the fusrodah-ing, and everything else about this game. then i hit 75 hours of playtime, and decided ive had enough and got bored of it all. such a pity i never went far in the main quest storyline. would definitely come back to finish the main quest, one day.",1
"there are still many bugs with the game (especially with the main story line) so i highly recommend you start a test play through, download and experiement with different mods, download the unofficial patch mods to fix most bugs and start a new game. this way you are going to save yourself a lot of frustration later on.",1
"modded it so i could kill children with cabbages. modded it again so i could roleplay as pyramid head. modded it again so i could shoot rocket powered exploding mudcrabs. 10/10 would mod and murder again.",1
"absolutely one of the best games ever created. the game is well written, well designed, well concieved, and infitely customizable. i cannot recommend more highly!",1
"want to waste hours adventuring to far away lands, scaling mountains of content, and hunting to find the best treasured objects? oh no thats just the modding section of the game, i cant review the experience itsself.",1
"*warning* this game will take away months off your life and destroy your social life. *play at own risk* this game is one of the best single player rpgs ever created along with oblivion and morrowind and will offer you 5000+ hours of gameplay and community mods guarantee endless replayabilliy value. 11/10",1
"buy it. its a great open world game, and with funny mods i think its one of the best games i have ever played.",1
"skyrim, a detailed game about a prisoner who is making his way downtown , walking fast, faces past and hes homebound.",1
"best game of the last generation made even better with mods :)",1
"i wouldnt call this game an rpg because it isnt but, its still a superb game which i put many hours, the atmosphere is amazing, the landscape is beautiful and with mods you can enhance the game even further.",2
"ive spent countless hours on this game. it is the symbol for the low points of my life where id play this game for hours on end. it is a testament to humanitys failure and a manifestation of my own innate sin. overall not bad.",2
"you can kill people and have a beard. do i need to say any more? 10/10",1
"you can easily sink 100 hrs into this game...and not even scratch the surface. its goty 2011 for a reason....theres just so much stuff to do.",1
"pure video game crack. 10/10 find out why an arrow to the knee is bad for adventurers.",1
"simply amazing. the best elder scrolls game to date.",1
"admittedly, theres nothing here that will change the minds of those who stubbornly cling to the rpg concepts of days gone by. but i think its safe to say that everyone else will find bethesdas work on skyrim to be their best yet.",2
"played this game for 1001 hours now maxed out mods still not crashing skyrim is love skyrim is life everyday skyrim",4
"as always a great keeping in line with its prequels, and adding a lot of great stuff. with a huge world to discover, and plenty of opportunities, just go and explore and play as you enjoy to. dont make the mistake i did and read too much about how to improve youre character on the forums, or you might get to the point where youll way more powerful then anything youll encounter, thus ruining youre game experience. i definitely recommend this game, with all its expansions, and with all the mods out there, youll have hundreds of hours to play and still be having new things to do and discover.",2
"its so fun to walk around and then get sneak attacked by dragons!! this game offers players who have just come to the rpg franchise an easyier start rather than games such as morrowind. the modding community keeps this game going, there are so many visual mods, gamplay mods and even sillier mods such as predators and stuff.",1
"very good game for role playing users. the workshop section allows for replayability and adds more depth to the game. the vanilla version is already amazing, adding dlc and mods is added icing. however, i do wish there was multiplayer with the added mods, would create a really good experience.",1
"its a good rpg game,the dlc are good,like the steam workshop mods, i would give this 10/10",1
"plays beautifully in crossover for mac 13.x!!! mac pro os x 10.9.x. ati 5770 graphics.",1
"skyrim, it is one those games that is so good, there are joke reviews of it on the storepage. 10/10 would review again",2
"this is a great game. 7/10 it does have some bugs and glitches (can be fixed with mods) but in general, its an awesome game. ive spent dozens of hours on this game and i can say, if you dont have the game yet, youre missing out.",2
"this is a whole new world, easy to learn, difficult to master. will keep you entertained for years, and vastly extensible by mods.",1
"do i really need to say anything.....really. do it. do it. come on just do it. do it come on. just the tip. just the tip to see how it feels.",1
"excellent game; great graphics, immersive story, huge open world. a must buy if you enjoy rpgs, as are all games in the elder scrolls series.",1
"awesome game! one of the few games where i have spent over 200 hours",1
"awsome game, emersive story and awsome modding comunity 10/10",1
"op best game ever made until now. doesnt matter what they say about inquisition, skyrim will always be in my soul. doesnt matter if they say you can just download it, its offline i dont give a , just support the ing game, because its epic.",1
"i would recommend this game to anyone who likes open world games. i completed every questline, dlc and faction on the xbox 360 for this game and just had to buy it for pc too. in fact love tes so much i bought the anthology. this game is great, it can get addictive and is easy to rack up hours of playing. if microsoft measured hours of play time on the xbox, i would surely be in the thousands and i cant wait to play it all over again on the pc. i love this game so much, it has great artistic design, which creates a great visual experience. the game also adapts to the player as yuo progress and become stronger, so do your enemies, so youll never run out of challenging oppents. there is so much to explore that you cant help but keep playing! so strap yourself in because this game will keep you up till 4/5 am with enjoyment and will keep you indoors for days on end, even on the brightest of days. this is a game that is easy to fall in love with. so what are you waiting for, love it already!",1
"one of the best games of this type. the quality of graphics processing is excellent, the developer is not the complaint. the gameplay is good and a couple of small mistakes, but they carry up so visible. so this game ssa not say anything that would be players who love this game tip discourage this game.",1
"this game is epic in scale with great combat mechanics and is always fresh with the many thousands of mods you can apply. and if you have an interest in game design or level design the creation kit could be for you, it allows you to customise almost every aspect of the game so get out there and get it!",1
"yeah... did everything on the ps3. even with all the glitches and bugs, i did everything. everything i could, got the platinum trophy and waited a damned year for the dlc. got my character to level 142. now if i did all of that on the ps3, with all of those damned bugs. you gotta know this is a good game. now ive got to do them on steam... with less bugs included. yes i recommend it and yes i feel sorry for you if you have to yet to play it.",2
"i highly reccomend the legendary edition because you get all of the dlc-s for a great price an some more quests,armor,spells,shouts",2
"an excellent, engaging game of its genre. highly recommend it for hours of entertainment.",2
"my favorite game to date. many days have gone by without me noticing, as i continue to plug away at this immersive rpg. lots of user customization and class creation options. great story and gigantic map. i have played it multiple times on multiple playforms and it still hasnt lost its draw. thank you bethesda!",1
"great game. you can do any things in this open world game. in addition, you can add mod from steam workshop and/or nexus mod which improve a lot of things and change the game in your own way. my score: 10 out of 10",1
"an amazing rpg with a lot of things to do and with a variety of weapons , armors , decisions and of course mods.",1
"best bethesda game yet can spend forever playing :)",1

"one of the best games ive played. great storyline, soundtrack and design!",1

"if you like rim jobs why not get one from the sky? 8/10 distinct lack of what title implies",1
"this is the ultimate game. played it at least 100 hours on xbox360, then bought it on steam to play with mods (which make it a whole new experience). get this game - you wont be disappointed. your social life, however...",1
"good game with plenty of mods to add to. it has a lot of replay ability and i found myself playing it more and more. morrowind was my favorite and this game is just about second. the game has great combat flow and i have fun killing my enemies with magic, a sword, hammer, etc. the mods add even more fun and unique weapons and spells. mods even add story lines and missions, even dungeons are added. a very good game.",1
"the elder scrolls v skyrim is a compelling game that doesnt set a main guy. you can create any character you want to play wether its an assissin or a warrior there is endless possibilities. the graphics are amazing and the story line is breath taking. i would rate this game 9.7/10",1
"buying this for you, vlad, but only if you instal macho mann mod.",1
"cool game. tough you should totally use mods once youre done with the main quest. also, like oblivion, it feels way simplier than previous installements. you should get it but be aware that if youre a fan of previous games, you should play at higher difficulty levels, since this game is so much easier than previous ones. id make a fus roh dah joke, but that shout isnt even the best one so.",1
"just started to play the game i dont think i love it but i dont hate it. bought the legendary edition for $20 which was so worth. i reccomend buying this on sale if you dont own it allready.",1

"awesome game, believable and huge world, thrilling quests and enough content for 100h to enjoy. truly an elder scrolls game",2
"ruined my life but still best game ever with or without dlc 10/10",1
"fantastic open world adventure - so much to do, so little time in rl to do it!",3
"my hours should say all you need to know... just buy the bloody game already! i mean, do you really need a review to convince you?! this should be common sense by now.if you dont find fun in endlessly exploring a massive, open world with so many quests no man alive can keep track of, and when youre done you can download mods to make you a jedi, and hobbit, a superhero, a questing knight, or even a bloody space crab, then i wonder how you live! all jokes aside though, just buy the game.",1
"everyone should have this in their library. there is countless hours of story and gameplay, and the skill tree makes that even more adventurous.",1
"do i really need to say anything? go play skyrim you s!",1
"bought it 2 years ago and i still play it... the elder scrolls iv: skyrim is a game full of adventure and stories, when you play it feels like the world is speaking to you. every corner has its own story to tell. also i love the way you can mod thiss game.. it almost has no limits and if there is one there is always a solution. i would love it that people support bethesda and buy this game..",2
"its skyrim; its been rated 10/10 by the pope any other reason not to buy it, i think not, buy it, then mod the  out of it, then buy the dlcs cos you need more to do and there are no friends around as it is lonely in the vatican and the choir boys are busy.",3
"best singleplayer open world rpg ive ever played, go get it.",1
"ive always loved this game and i got it for computer and i find it better. i enjoy this game!",1
"had it for ps3 and xbox but know on pc this is much more fun and immersive with mods",1
"this game is amazing. i dont really need to sing its praises. since its 50% off today, i would entirely recommend picking it up if you can spare $30.",1
"help couldnt get past execution, got killed too quickly",1
"one of the greatest rpgs of all time. it is hours of endless fun with many but limited personalization! if you are looking to kill alot of time, in a mid evil way skyrim is the way to go. -medicus-",1
"i am grudgingly forced to concede, after 200+ hours, that this is easily in the top 5 best games ever made.",2
"this is easily my favorite game i have and ever played. it was my first in the tes series and i have gone back and played oblivion and morrowind, still skyrim is my fav, i first got in on the xbox and had over 1000 hours, made the switch to pc and couldnt be happier to start all over again, if you are thinking about it just get it you will not regret it, my advice also pick up the dlc it is worth it",1
"is there a need for a review? dont you have internet connection? awesome gameplay, great graphics (for a rpg), and a crapton of mods on the workshop to extend your gameplay... this is just pure epic. and dont forget the soundtrack!",1
"between a very nicely executed sandbox, some good dlc and a near-endless supply of interesting mods, theres very little to complain about with skyrim if youre looking for epic faffing-about action.",3
"what can i say? i have been a fan of the elder scrolls for a while now and they get better each time. everything about this game is enjoyable (even the times when a dragon comes down and wrecks your ). the use of mods takes that even further with seperate items and retextures available for use. any rpg fan should pick this up.",1
"i absoluetly recommend this game to everyone. graphics are stunning and the story is interesting. you can literally do whatever you want. plus, killing dragons is the kind of stuff that i dreamed about as a kid, and now with the dlc i can ride one. nothing cooler than that.",1
"i like this game very much but it keeps crashing for some reason.",1
"if you havent bought this game yet you arent using steam properly.",1
"fantastic rpg/action/adventure game. its got an ample amount of places to explore and things to do. theres plenty of quests and sidequests to take on. the game can also be pretty challenging depending on where you are, how powerful you are, etc. you will happily lose 100+ hours into this great game.",2
"the best electronic rpg ive ever played. beat the legendary baldur `s gate and the old (and fondly remembered) final fantasy. freedom, progressive difficulty, challenging all the time, semi-realistic, and without a doubt, the best representation of dragons ive ever seen. pasar by a city and see the shadow cutting on you, and then look around, hear the roar of the monster and find it landing on a bridge while guards run around and people flee to their homes. fight differently in the open, amid forests or snowstorms. and wonderful mods! o melhor rpg eletrnico que j joguei. bateu o lendrio baldur`s gate e os velhos (e carinhosamente lembrados) final fantasy. liberdade, dificuldade progressiva, desafiador o tempo todo, semi-realista, e sem sombra de dvida, a melhor representao de drages que eu j vi. pasar por uma cidade e ver a sombra cortando sobre voc, e ento olhar em volta, ouvir o estrondo do monstro pousando e encontr-lo sobre uma ponte enquanto guardas correm em volta e o povo foge para suas casas. lutar de forma diferente em campo aberto, em meio a florestas ou tempestades de neve. e mods maravilhosos!",5
"this game is fun and it deserves all the praise it gets. getting mods for the game completes it even further.",1
"amazing all of the mods and it has a fantastic story",1
"a very nice rpg. would recommend to anyone looking for a modern rpg! :d",1
"if you have not played this game yet, you have not lived yet.",2
"very good game, beautiful graphics, good replayability, an awesome soundtrack, and insanely fun to play. i can spend hours playing without even realizing it.",1
"ive played all the elder scrolls games so far and i really enjoyed skyrim. the graphics are awesome and of course who doesnt love the thieves guild and the dark brotherhood story lines. great game and one i continue to play even though i also play elder scrolls online.",2
"though not so good at combat experience, tesv sure impresses me with its huge world and remarkable freedom. and its great variety of mods avaliable keeps me a devoted player even after several times i completed its main quests.",1
"skyrim is everything i came to expect from a free-roam rpg. from character customization to spells and enchantments to the different enemies that come crashing through after you on your quest, this game delivers. a healthy mod community also delivers engaging (and sometimes ridiculous) mods to suit your fancy and every occassion. i recommend playing the dlc as well once youve finished the skyrim original content.",2
"an awesome fifth installment to a legendary series. i heartily recommend this game if you enjoy exploration, in depth missions, and an exciting huge open world. the game can also be expanded hugely upon with the additions from the modding community.",2
"one of the best rpgs up to date - vast, open world, tons of quests to complete and complete freedom of you actions - you can follow main storyline or dont mind it and go do side quests. game almost never ends, there always is something more to do. only thing that can be annoying, that after reaching certain level you become almost immortal and nothing can do you any harm. anyway, this game is highly recommended to any prg fan, especially to ones that haft soft spot for elder scroll series in their heart :)",1
"this game is worth paying money if you played xbox version this is waay better because you can get mods and it makes it way more fun",1
"accidently stole a plate trying to talk to a npc, from the towns reaction i can only assume i was worse than hitler.",1
"dragons, destiny, dungeons, and drauger. a massive, immensely immersive world. fully upgradeable, moddable, configurable. and most important of all, the cake is not a lie, not in skyrim. this is easily one of the best games i have ever played, and i consider it one of the great games for the ages.",2
"this is one of my favorite games, id recomend it to everyone",1
"alone, an imerssive game that will make you want to stead away from the main story to complete all side missions and starnge enough youll not get bored instead youll feel motivated to complete everything. with mods? a whole new story. mod developers have proven that anything can be done to this game, weapons, armors, skills, magic, buildings, animals, npcs, just about everything in the game can be moded including the battle animations and voice over, even the music the bards play!!! with mods even after completeing a mojority of the game which took me about 140 hours, youll still be engrossed this time thinking about what mod will come next as you fly around with a fly mod.",1
"beautiful and uncomprehensibly expansive, skyrim will keep you busy for way more than 100 hours with its massive selection of main, side and random quests, ranging from leading a civil war to helping out a talking dog. and holy , you have to see this thing on a retina display.",1
"one of the best games in the world not better than online but still very good a must buy",1
"this is awesome but i dont havea lot of space on my computer so it is laggy so its less experinced but still if you have alot of space on your computer get it",1
"if you have hundeds of hours of spare time on your hands, be sure to check out skyrim. this game will suck you in, even after putting it down for a while and picking up back up. more side quests than you will know what to do with, great voice acting, and with the power of mods out there, you can turn it hyper-realistic, and get a level of graphics you could never achieve in versions out for consoles.",2
"this game is soo amazing i have been playing elder scrolls game my whole life and never get bored with them",1
"im really enjoying this game. just wish i had more time to play.",1
"boring. so tired of the fantasy genre, and thought nothing could make it more uneventful. i was wrong.",1
"picked it up during the summer sale , must say this game was worth every dime, + the steam workshop mods make this game like 10x better. 99/100 would recomend",1
"fantasy hero simulator 2011 stupid nords insulted my choice to become a mage, calling into question my manliness. i can shoot fire from one hand and lightning from another. i killed a dragon and absorbed its power. my shout is so powerful that people stagger backwards. tell me nords, do you still think that i am unmanly now?! (10/10, would mage again)",1
"i hope to get to the end of a playthrough one day... but  tons of fun still. dem mods are  fun too.",2
"this game ... well its not all that great , i greatly prefer the fallout series , however its not just that , this game is extremly buggy and is far over rated, but this is coming from someone who greatly enjoys fallout new vegas . just there are common texture issues and such , i do reccomend it because its fun but i think that a title such as fallout 3 or maybe some of the older fallouts would be better , maybe you might like oblivion more , just this game is just overrated and not all that people say it is , however mods can fix some of your problems",1
"i wanted to write a recommendation , but than i took an arrow in the knee.",1
"the elder scrolls v skyrim: if youre reading this recommendation you probably already own the game, or wanting it really bad and already know the value of this game. this game is probably my favorite game of all time. in my opinion, this is bethesdas greatest creation yet. living the life of the dragonborn, youre a hero, a townsfolk and dragonkiller. hundreds of ingame itmes and features ready for your disposal. i absolutely lvoe this game. but get it for pc, because you know why? mods! yes mods. which can enhance your gaming experience to an all new level! and also fixes everything bethesda missed in the process of making this game. i have put over 250+ hours, started over about a dozen times and still in love with this game, so much replay value, its absurd. what are you waiting for? just get this game if you have not already! b)",2
"i love this game so much you should get it. also skooma",1
"very, very fun game. pretty intense straight from the start. only downfall is that your companions can can get easily lost. theyll eventually come back if you fast travel, but wont do you good if youre by yourself fighting a dragon. other than that, excellent game and i would recommend it to everyone.",1
"i pushed a gargoyle on a wedding ceramony and killed the bride. - 10/10",1
"best elder scrolls to yet, if you dont have this game, your missing out 10/10 :0",2
"this is probably one of the most epic games ever created! it keeps you entertained for hours on end with multiple quests that you can complete or just random running around.",1
"skyrim is everything i came to expect from a free-roam rpg. from character customization to spells and enchantments to the different enemies that come crashing through after you on your quest, this game delivers. a healthy mod community also delivers engaging (and sometimes ridiculous) mods to suit your fancy and every occassion. i recommend playing the dlc as well once youve finished the skyrim original content.",2
"hands down best damn game ever made besides final fantasy 7!!!",1
"just a huge game. i havent played that much of the story because ive just been messing around and having fun. i could see getting 200+ hours out of this game. great deal. note: i havent played any dlc for this game. i cant review this downloadable story quests and packs. 9/10",1
"this game is a masterpiece. i recently bought this for the pc because it was cheaper to get the whole game with the dlc on pc than it was to download the dlc from the xbox 360. this opened up the ability to mod the application as well, which isnt a possiblity on the console version. cant wait to play skyrim all over again after playing for over 200 hours on the console version.",1
"1000+ hrs spent in beautiful skyrim speak for themselves, right? right! :)",4
"skyrim has been a fantastic outlet for me during some pretty rough times as well as good times. if you can modify it, it can be immersive as heck - letting you delve into a deep, fantastical world. i surely recommend it!",2
"love everything about this game. i have played this game across 2 formats (ps3 - pc) and have found pc to be the best as it loads faster and there are mods to get around glitches.",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. great for all platforms. very fun and a lot of things to do! 10/10",1
"300 hours of play so far. still fun and not even finished yet...",2
"this game is better than life. buy it and see. 10/10",1
"when you can see ants on a log, you know its a good game!",1
"i put a bag on someones head and stole everything.",1
"game is amazing!! i just wish the story was a bit more fulfilling than just go to a  ton of little caves, visit a club full of santas on top of a mountain and breath on dragons until they die. i bet gaben could do better <3",1
"awesome, if not the best rpg i ever played. top grafix, lots of quests, armors, npcs, stories. dont forget to mod it with nexus mods for maximum pleasure.",2
"fought a giant and got free lift to the moon 10/10 best game ever",1
"you can put pots on peoples heads and they cant see you :)",1
"its about dragons and people that shout. no more to it. go home.",1
"it starts out great but older players might find the game lacking in alot of rpg features like durability loss, custom spells. my personal big problem is the wobbling camera when swinging weapons",1
"just amazing. i cant wait to playeso idc what people say about it and gets me excited to play eso while i wait.",1
"skyrim is another world better then this one in so many ways, you really do live another life. i always thught skyrim was just another bad aaa game then one day i saw the witcher 2 on sale so i added founds to my steam for the first time and i got it, then i saw g-mod witcher 1 and darksouls 1 and got then too but then i saw skyrim i didnt expect to like it but i got it... i fell in love. i have played over 850 hours of skyrim i have gotten all 75 achievements the level 5 badge all the emoticons and backgrounds, skyrim is one of my top 3 games of all time. if you see this game on sale buy it. i will never forget! i am harbinger!, i am nightingale!, i am arch-mage!, i am dawnguard!, i am legate!, i am dragonborn!.",4
"great game, havent spent to much time, due to school and stuff, the combat is good, graphics are stunning, and the dungeon crawl i went on took me a while too.",1
"the pinnacle of open-world rpgs. you simply wont find a game with more freedom. be who you want. do what you want. go where you want. pros: -you can breathe fire. -rampant misogyny. -overt racism. -ability to decapitate your foes. -alcoholism. -moon sugar. cons: -bears. -two main quests that are in no way related. -government bureaucracy. -milkdrinkers. i would recommend this game to men, narcissists, politicians, bear hunters.",1
"due to my hatred towards bethesda i refuse to play this game. why do i have it? cost $10 at bestbuy.",1
"spider punching? yelling at dragons? mods for every single weird kink you may have? game of this generation.",1
"lame ending. that said the game is full of win! played it for six months racking up 250 hours of game play and i feel like i barely scratched the surface.",1
"excellent rpg. its faithful to the elder scrolls series regarding to combat and spells. i would recommend installing one of the perk mods ( is the best one in my opinion) since the vanilla perks can be a bit on the boring side. great atmosphere, visuals and music. would recommend!",1
"i loved this game and even today i keep playing it i love it and cant wait for elder scrolls online",1
"get. this. game. awesome. my brother and i built a computer for this game, and it was soo worth it. just get it.",3
"fun game, i recommend it, bethesda studios really outdid themselves with this one, character interaction is so much better than oblivion and alot better dialogue",2
"skyrim is an all around great game, but it doesnt feel like a proper elder scrolls game. although it has the same mechanics as previous installments, the shouts make it feel like a different game and the dragons make it seem more generic. dual-weilding was a nice touch though. the fact that you didnt need a class and all skills could level you up was a much needed change in my opinion, and the marriage system and adoption system in the hearthfire dlc, add a sense of realism to the game.",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",1
"the games great but if u alt tab or ctl w the game glichtes and u cant play the u need to start it again and that whole quest u were doing have fun doing it again",1
"love this game to death. if i were stuck on a desert island and i had to chose one thing to entertain me for the rest of my life all i would need is a monitor, a pc, skyrim, and the steam workshop. a must buy for any rpg fan. some people do thing the game is a bit dumbed down from the other games but thats easily forgivable due to all the improvments to things like skills, leveling up, races, classes and so much more. you can pore hundreds upon hundreds of hours into this game and it will feel like minutes. and did i mention all the cool mods you can download or subscribe to. theyre all free and some deserve their own game if it is a story mod. i give it a 10/10 for sure.",1
"it never ends.... it was supposed to end, but it didnt im in this games grasp and cannot escape. please send help please... please... (oh and 9/10, get it)",1
"skyrim, where do i start? great game, great mod support its fabulous! i can ultra the game on my r9 270 no sweat without mods and gameplay is great! a game to recommend to almost anyone who wants to have a good singleplayer experience! could go on but it would be too long (and im too lazy hah) 10/10",1
"most of the local town shops sell spell books that bring back the dead for less than a helmet 10/10 most logical game logic ever",1
"absolutely fantastic. a game that truly offers endless possibilities.",1
"very unhappy...i could of bought this great game five pounds cheaper had i waited a month! :(",1
"bethesda delivers in the next instalment of the elder scrolls series. this emersive adventure allows the player a massive amount of freedom and choice as he or she takes the role of dragonborn. charge in to battle as a hammer wielding berserker, or kite your enemies as a masterful mage. lurk in the shadows as a theif or an assasin. the choice is yours. the possibilities are endless. above all, take the role of the savior of skyrim, choose your side in the epic civil war and bring an end to the terrible regn of the dovah, the dragons.",1
"in my opinion, this game is one of the best games ive ever played. its a whole world to explore, many quests to do and an entire new life to live on. so if you like adventure games, rolling playing games and so on, its a good choice for you.",2
"have played for many,many ours in console but its time to go back to the start... in pc :d",1
"one of the best games i ever played , and here on pc + modes is better",1
"i would reccomend this to anyone who have played open world games like gta or minecraft.",1
"great game...i play it all the time..i havnt played the pc version much but what time ive spent playin it, totally worth it! fantastic game",1
"if you never played rpgs cause they just didnt seem to be on your taste. youre gonna start playing all rpgs after you played this game. 98/10",1
"it is one of the best games that i have ever played",1
"i shouted at some cheese. it fell off of a shelf. i then shouted at a chicken. it died.",2
"bad game, no dragos an where the hel is max vonm sydow???",1
"it raggs a bit much in my laptop. guess its too much for it even with the lowest settings! besides its a great game as ive always known. many fun even with those cheats.",1
"i just got skyrim and so far its good and i can tell the rest is going to be good but the only problem is i get lost easly",2
"if you have always played fps and wondered why anyone would play a game where you look at yourself, heh, then try this one out because you can just turn your mousewheel to go from first person viewing to behind yourself ala third person. i personally got bored of trying to figure out the many, many different components like spells and just a wood bowl you have to learn how to hold or use. the weapons were floating around in midair or falling to the ground, heh, i guess i am spoiled by games like bf2 and far cry 2 and 3 in that i expect to play within a few hours somewhat of an enjoying type game. i would say it must be the best in that it is the only one since turok, dinosaur hunter that made me try the genre out. it really is a big beautiful game, if you are willing or already know how to use all of the devices and tricks. it is the biggest map i have ever played. it keeps the graphics inline, not too much hocus pocus, a lot of reality. you dont even have to use majic if you dont care too, like me. it is worth having if you ever get sick or break a heel like i did, this would have been welcom back then to pass time.",1
"a perfect follow up to oblivion, this game is seriuosly addicting!",1
"one of the best rpg ever! - there is such a big world to discover! - a unlimited amount of quests! - every few steps ypu will find something interesting! - amazing story! - incredible possibilities to change or add something to the game with the workshop story: 10/10 - gameplay: 9/10 - soundtrack: 10/10 - overhaul: 9,5/10 ==> get it! play it! love it!",2
"amazing game. spent hour after hour on it and you still feel like your not even half way. the only problem it suffers is the amount of missions why out lasts the progression in terms of weapons and your character. you quite quickly get to a point where you can kill everything very easily. the weapons are also very limited for such a massive game. they are about 15 to 20 weapons which only change depending on the level of skill they have been crafted and what they have been crafted from. the only other problem i have from it is it is so vast of a game it seems very be littling when you first start. when i first began i honestly had no idea what to do to progress in the game or how to do things people had been telling me where good parts of the game. some may find it a good thing you have to figure out everything in the game but for me i missed too much which annoyed me. overall however an amazing game which deserves at least a 9/10 and you most certainly get your moneys worth. can easily clock up 100 or even 200 hours which rivals a good call of duty game. you will never ever ever want to replay this however unless you are a totally dedicated fan. you lose way too much pressing new game.",1
"this game is an absolute must have. the story is very engaging, and even though ive put over 200 hours in im only using the third best armor tier, so theres still lots to do. i tell you, if theres an engaging game, this is it.",1
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"i cant get enough. just wow. everyone should play this game.",1
"cant recommend this game highly enough for all those out there who enjoy rpg and wide open play spaces. graphics will just blow you away.",3
"in life im a simple 21-year old male in college. but in here, i am odinkerr, dragonborn, harbinger of the companions, vampire slayer and defiler of the cruel! put aside the wothless peon; become who you were born to be!",2

"no matter how many times i break this game with mods, something compels me to fix it and play. its one of those games with near infinite replay value. just wish bethesda would release games that didnt need to be patched by the community...",5
"mods. mods everywhere. cant stop installing mods. buy the game now!!!",1

"the best electronic rpg ive ever played. beat the legendary baldur `s gate and the old (and fondly remembered) final fantasy. freedom, progressive difficulty, challenging all the time, semi-realistic, and without a doubt, the best representation of dragons ive ever seen. pasar by a city and see the shadow cutting on you, and then look around, hear the roar of the monster and find it landing on a bridge while guards run around and people flee to their homes. fight differently in the open, amid forests or snowstorms. and wonderful mods! o melhor rpg eletrnico que j joguei. bateu o lendrio baldur`s gate e os velhos (e carinhosamente lembrados) final fantasy. liberdade, dificuldade progressiva, desafiador o tempo todo, semi-realista, e sem sombra de dvida, a melhor representao de drages que eu j vi. pasar por uma cidade e ver a sombra cortando sobre voc, e ento olhar em volta, ouvir o estrondo do monstro pousando e encontr-lo sobre uma ponte enquanto guardas correm em volta e o povo foge para suas casas. lutar de forma diferente em campo aberto, em meio a florestas ou tempestades de neve. e mods maravilhosos!",5
"any game that allows you to go around as spiderman with majoras mask and a keyblade is a must buy in my book, as is this for that exact reason. do you get my meaning yet?!",1
"better on pc then! lots of extras on worshop. and the rest of this review is just so i can get a badge",1
"loved the game. buy it play it love it do it. best game ever",1
"very fun game, love the graphics and the open world sandbox feeling, as is the soul of the elder scrolls games. leveling system is great, very flexible, good combat and magic system. best of all, great for modding!",2
"skyrim never pulled me in like other rpgs have. i cant really say why, but it just felt... empty, and uninspiring. i was supposed to feel incredibly powerful, but i just felt bored.",1
"this game is fun to play as a waiting for something to download and it has a nice storyline and great voice actors so i rate this game 8/10",1
"skyrim is an amazing game. 10/10 everything about it, the gameplay, the combat, the leveling, just everything is awesome. there is a lot of content in the game, so be prepared to spend hundreds of hours in skyrim. well, go buy it. like now!",1
"if a man came into my house,  me, killed my family,  me again, went into the future and aborted my children, and then came back and shot me in the kneecaps i would hate him less than this game. please. save yourself. dont do it.",2
"if i have 107 hours on record and ive only been able to use 800x600 resolutions and kept all the other settings on the lowest possible level, the game has to be pretty good. 5/5 ebin",1
"great game, a lot of fun. can be a bit tedious at times though if youre searching for absolutely every little thing like i am. [i have a tendancy to ignore the main quests to go exploring....kinda makes the game a lot longer than it already is....]",1
"id like to write a recommendation for skyrim... but i cant seem to stop playing for long enough to do so! ;)",2
"like every other tes game, except its designed for 3-year olds. overrated.",1
"this is game is amazing!!! i loved the quality of it and it has an amazing story line with extra sidequests... its never ending i swear...",1
"great game and if you find it getting boring....steam workshop",1
"i have always loved the elder scrolls series since morrowind and i was only around age 10 or 11 when i always played that game, constantly starting new characters going for the daedric artifacts and such and this is bethsedas current master piece theres still a bug or two, and a glitch where my saves become corrupt sometimes, but i still love it, especially modding it, always have and will love modding the elder scrolls franchise.",1
"good game fun, doesnt take much to run it. and steam screwed me because it was 75% off right after i bought it for full price :(",1
"people who like rpg should really play this game... and if you already have; then good for you, because i really recommend this game to anyone who enjoy playing rpg, adventure.... and i already know that the friends that i have on my list like dungeon siege iii, so play skyrim as well!!! =)",4
"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",1
"awesome game. if you like killing bandits and absorbing dragon souls in your free time definitly check skyrim out.",1
"i have been a big fan for the rpg. countless hours wasted playing the previous game, oblivion. skyrim has been one of the largest, uniquest and funnest games i have ever played. the elder scrolls is truly, without a doubt, the best game series of all time.",1
"cleanist running game and hours of gameplay with the main questline.",1
"it is an amazing mmo rpg game if u dont have it u should buy it",1
"well im not going to talk much about game but just listen to this words carfully and i know u gonna understand actually i cracked this game as to play it normally as any other cracked game althought its single player till this moment but i just decided to buy it (money doesnt grow on trees) im not going to say more i think the message has been delieved:)",1
"why do people like this game? an rpg is about actual story and the choices you make and leveling up your character. none of this makes any difference and no choices in any factions mke any difference to your non-existent storyline. worst of all you wander for 2 hours just getting to your destination so that you maybe get there. major time waster.",1
"i dont play rpg games that much but this one is just perfect .",1
"this game is great very open and there are tons of quests. ive been playing this for about a month and i see no end to this game.",1
"best rpg since oblivion and gothic ii. 10/10! 2 years after release its still the best rpg on the market. the elder scrolls is the best rpg series ever! everyone who loves rpg must buy this game!",1
"i played it like mad until completion, but never touched it again after the ending. it was tons of fun while it lasted.",1

"theres a staff that turns people into a sweet roll 10/10",2
"given the relase of eso, this may be last elder scrolls game worth playing. content...i have never played a game with more content pre-modding than skyrim. i have 80 ish games and only a few are anywhere near 400 logged hours. this game speaks to me in a way that can only be described by playing it. seriously. do yourself a favour...no, do your imagination a favour. go buy this game and and make sure you have a beer fridge and/or freezer with a microwave nearby. let work know youre cashing in your holidays at once. all of them. turn your phone not just on silent, but off. enjoy. that is all.",2
"skyrim is the best game ive played in a long time, i love it, i have it on ps3 and pc. the mods will keep you entertained once you have played it for 200+ hours, which is one of the reasons to have this on the pc. if youre thinking about getting this game you deffinitly should! it keeps you entertained for hours and it feels like minutes.",1
"this game really does deserve a 10/10. and 10/10 does not mean zomg best *profanity here* game ever, good lawd my eyes are melting. by 10/10, i mean that this game has everything that you want in an open world, fantasy, rpg game. +well developed ai dialogue +well written stories +quests and a backstory behind every unique npc +realtime development within game outside of your experiences (e.g. family, guilds, quests that are about to involve you.) +change within dialogue according to players decisions +good combat system +great crafting system +great level up system +great graphics +good ai programming +wide and varying land. *if youre complaining that skyrim looks bland, boring and same everywhere to you, im betting $10 that you exclusively travel via fast travel. shame on you. and finally +theres a well written political strife involved within the civil conflict of skyrim: so factions. right now, this game is a steal for $30. even for its opening retail price, it is one of the best games out there in the market right now. whether you like by the book rpg games or unique rpgs with a strange twist such as sci fi, skyrim is a great game for anybody looking for a game that is quite possibly the most immersive fantasy adventure experience. and this is coming from a cat. so you can trust me.",1
"this game is so badass. even if you end up beating the game, the modding communtity just makes it amazing. it also runs on fairly any pc so u dont really got to worry about that.",1
"love it! one of my favourite games... storyline though was disappointing compared to oblivions.",1
"if you havent got this yet, you are seriously missing out",1
"best game ever created by bethesda. along with the multitude of mods you can get from the wonderful steam community, this game has a very long playability to it.",1
"i have played this game without any hiches until i reloaded it. i will say it is one of the best games i have ever played without a walkthrough.",5
"i spent countless hour on this master piece ....... until i took an arrow in the knee",2
"stepped out into the world. killed by a wolf. 11/10",1
"this game is a masterpiece. after oblivion, we never thought bethesda could offer the player a better experience but they managed to outdo themselves with a game that is now a reference as well as an iconic pop culture icon.",1
"you can turn people into animals using wabbajack. 10/10. spent too much time on it on ps3, now its time to replay it on pc.",1
"this game is: 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of will 5% pleasure 50% pain and 100% reason to purchase the game.",2
"love the game. this vesion being the legendary pack was recommended by a freind. purchased dvd rom version with map. worth every cent. one gripe though serana needs official marrage ability and dialogue. otherwise is she a lover of the dragonborn without the ability nor the lover perks? having been cured of her vampireism the comments about being so bright how can you stand it can become tiresome. the biggest gripe is being disturbed while playing or trying to play...lol ;) how about releasing all games and maps with all expansion packs included maybe before elder scrolls 6 released? (have not tried putting all elder scrolls onto one hd but want to build hd with all elder scrolls games on it one day...). pitty my disks from 1 to 5 vanished when moving a few years back...) if you like the game buy a physical copy and get your maps, if you use stream you dont get hard copies of anything. also pausing game leaving pc running seems to add up playtime i have not clocked the acual amount in world game time as shown on steam. have it paused by pressing esc and game time still logs up...",4
"just when i thought i was out... they pull me back in. - michael corleone who am i kidding? i was never out on this game. 2 years and ~420 hours later im still finding new things to do and places to explore. betwen morrowind, oblivion and skyrim ive probably spent way more time than is healthy traversing the landscapes of tamriel. and the mods available for skyrim now have me wanting to go back to morrowind and oblivion, freshly modded up, for another round.",2
"what can i say about the best rpg of all time!!! j/k. i like it a lot though. 10/10",1
"there are few words which can describe just how amazing this game is. yes, there are a few bugs but they arent game breaking, nor will they reduce your enjoyment of the game. a huge, detailed world is at your disposal, for you to do what you wish. want to complete the story as fast as possible then go ahead, you are free to do so. want to be a completionist and do all the quests available? afraid not, as the quests are endless, randomly generated throughout your time in the world. add to this the steam workshop you literally have endless amounts of content! sorry you completionist types :( the combat feels responsive, the heavy blows feel meaty and the varying types of armour make the character feel different, whether you are wearing robes or heavy plate, mould your character into whatever you want them to be. if you are a fan of rpgs and action then you simply have to play this game. if you arent a fan then still have to play this game!",1
"spectacular game. gives you the freedon to play the way you want.",2
"a game that was quickly accepted as a timeless classic.",1
"definately one of the greatest games i have ever played, last gen game however with new immersion mods etc coming out all the time, it feels next gen. plenty of different storylines, all completely optional. many play styles you suit you and an all round brilliant game.",2
"dived off a cliff and 1 hit a giant 10/10 would do again",1
"easily one of the best games out there. even if you already have it on console, get it on pc for the mods. too bad bethesda ed up tes with elder scrolls online... d;",1
"this is a great game if you like adventures the game is made even better with dlc and mods but the base game is fine without them only 1 negative some guilds quest line can feel empty oblivion was better guild quest wise but apart from that great game. and if you want a good mod with dawnguard try castle volkihar redux by digital cleaner which is a steam exlusive",3
"this is an amazing game!! been playing for over a year and have beat it once and there are so many other things to do it has a huge replay value.",1
"such an amazing game! totally improves upon oblivion and borrows several elements that were good in the fallout series. a truly massive world with endless possiblities, things to do, and places to see.",2
"i love this game everything is great the only thing missing is the lack of co op.",1
"10/10 would play again gives massive boner and more!",1
"awsome game !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

"i copy-and-pasted my pony mods 40 times just to make sure they work and ended up destroying tamriel whole because of the amount of giant derpies that kept spawning all over the place along with some humanized derpy courier giving me pony items every 4 minutes. 10/10 fallout with swords",1
"my game glitched and now im stuck on a flying dragon. 10/10 would repeat",1
"amazing game. great for both hardcore gamers and casual players. the world is expansive and enthrawling. it is easy to get lost in this magestic and dark world.",1
"its a good game to play if youve ever wanted to live in a fantasy world of adventure, and build your way to the top tier of awesome. all kinds of monsters, creatures, and people exist for you to fight, befriend, and protect. and, overall, it has a beautiful way of presenting the world to you. easy to pick up for new players to the franchise.",1
"this game is the greatist game i have ever got i started only thinking this looks good but boy was i wrong. the story is massivly addictive. and you can always find or go somewhere new no matter how many times to restert the game. then you add all the mods in to the equation and the possabilitys for the gave become endless. the grates game i have ever had.",2
"the latest installation in the elder scrolls has had me captivated for so many hours i dont even want to actually know, but buying it from the day of release on 11.11.11, to this day it still lies high on my list of games to play when im bored. escapism at its greatest, and when youre given so much freedom its so easy to get lost in, skyrim is no.1 for rpg games ive come across in terms of replayability, design and gameplay. people may mock it for its petty flaws here and there, but its list of flaws compared to its list of triumphs is dwarfed massively. with lore so deep, i dread to think i may know more about elder scrolls history than real life history, but this is just yet another aspect of not only the game, but the series which makes the world feel so real and alive. with un-beaten character customisation and development, this allows players to create any character they can possibly imagine and play to as style which they choose. to any rpg fans whom havent yet discovered the elder scrolls series or for those looking to get into the genre, i cannot recommend this game enough, if you fall in love with the series like all elder scrolls fans do, youll get your moneys worth without a doubt.",1
"this game is awesome! its been 3 years and im still enjoying it. if you get the chance to buy it, buy it. youll not regret it. mods also makes this game really fun and each and every mod grabs your attention.",1
"to anyone who has not played this game yet - bloody buy this now.",1
"this game is absolutely amazing. i must say that the programing gods at bethesda have really outdone themselves. skyrim offers a free roam world full of quests, secrets, and hidden tresures that litter the stunningly beautiful, midevil landscape. i would recommend this game to any gamer whether they prefer call of duty styled first person shooters, or world of warcraft styled rpgs. it also offers a number of dlc packs that will carry your adventure through the elder scrolls series even further! if you ever get bored of the run-of-the-mill questing crap you can always look towards the steam workshop for over 19,000 different gameplay enhancing mods. this work of art will always keep you on your toes, so keep yourself awake every night playing until your eyes are dryer than the sahara desert!",1
"i have played this game less than an hour and all i can say is this is very literally better than sex. unless its the kind of sex discussed on . you show me a game with   tits and ill ing buy it, mark my words.",3
"i cant add anything that has not been already told in the reviews. i like the new character leveling system. almost 120 hours of gaming and i still find it entertaining.",1
"ran my horse into a dragon, died about 2 seconds later. still trying to get better armour than iron. 11/10",1
"the best game i have ever bought! highly recommended.",1
"looking for a 10/10 aaa game? then youve come to the right place. even without modding, this game is incredibly good in all aspects, sure, there are of course bugs here and there, unpolished things, unfulfilling rewards from finishing major quest lines, repetetive quests, but these things dont really matter, because youll get hooked any way. add modding, and you have a game with unlimited potential!",5
"as most people already know, this game is amazing. the vast amount of content is unbelievable. i have put in over 100 hours, and feel like i am only half way through. as much as i like this game, i want to point the issues that i have faced. - this game is not optimized for quad core processors. my rig can run most new games on max settings at a smooth framerate. skyrim pushes my system to its limits. even at medium settings, i experience hiccups and frame drops. - there is a large amount of loading in this game. whenever you fast travel or enter/exit a city, you must endure a lengthy load screen. although the screens are pretty, it gets annoying. i do not have a ssd, if you do, this may not be as much of an issue. despite these two annoyances, i highly recommend this game. this game is a steal at $20 and if you get it on sale, you should be put in cuffs.",1
"with the exception of the bugs its an amazing game.",2
"even if u hav never played a tes game before you will love this 10/10",1
"tes v : skyrim is the opitamy of cinematic hardcore beautiful role playing at its deepest grandest splendor. you cant simply match a game of this caliber for me it is, possibly and truthfully the best 3d rpg ever made, but so unstable its pathetic. i do not reccomend this game if your looking for a solid product to mod to hell and back, youll end up with crashrim, not skyrim.",1
"i cant even play i bought legendary and normal on 2 accounts and yet it doesnt work ive tried everystep on the help page",1

"this game is an awesome open world fantasy bonanza that has huge potential for replay.",1
"best game of the year , dont be dumb and pirate this awesome game , show them that we pc gamer pay for a quality product like this . its worth your money, you get 200+ hours fun for it .",1
"one of the best wrpgs ever made, and surprisingly well optimized for pc if you meet the reqs.",1
"well, that is skyrim and workshops along with entertainment is assured",1
"its been almost 3 years after its release, and im still finding new locations...",1
"i almost have 500 hours logged into this game. enough said. also, get all the dlcs. theyre seriously worth it.",2
"fantastic game. so much to do, you can re-play and re-play a multitude of times and still find different things to do every playthrough, guaranteed. and then, there are the thousands and thousands (no hyperbole) of mods available, with which you can customise almost every imaginable facet of your character and/or gameworld. and if you ever feel that youre running out of stuff to complete or places to see (i doubt this will ever become an issue), a new mod or dlc will be released which will add dozens of hours of extra play-time to the game. theres tonnes and tonnes of stuff to do and see in the vanilla version of the game, too, if modding isnt your thing. in the time ive spent playing skyrim i could have quite easily mastered a foreign language, learnt to drive a car or settled down with a wife and kids. id still choose skyrim any day.",2
"this game gives us an amazing and terrific feeling from the world of skyrim! a huge world with many places intresting places to explore... many choises to evolve your character. graphics gameplay and soundtrack are all very impressive and its one of the best games i have ever played!!! mods will add unlimited value to this game... skyrim is really a pc exclusive game...",1
"this is a very fun game but eventually gets a little boring.. until you fight some dragons!!!",1
"an epic rpg, with a good story. the choice to play as thieves and assassins is always a great character option that keeps that tired hero theme in check. i found the dragons got boring after a while, but the massive world to explore, and good story twists make this a great game.",2
"i guess this new legendary edition means we wont even get 5 dlc.  you todd howard.",1
"best form of abstience out there since 2004, with wow, in all seriousness, this possibly may be the best open world rpg of all time. its a tough stander with some other games but this one blew me away back in 2011. had to buy again. dlc: its worth it, gives you at least another 40+ hours of playtime if you want to kill time, plus a super hard boss. story: one of the best, starting in a little village called helgen, you are a prisoner, you almost get beheaded, a dragon attacks. then you have to escape with a few guys to riverwood and go to whiterun to find out that you the players character, is the dragonborn. gameplay: top notch rpg, but not the kind of rpg you expect, like kill stuff and level, thats still there. but you level with crafting, sewing, etc. difficulty: suited to all, from novice as in a new person playing to legendary where we have a major league gaming tryout. play time: didnt play it much again on pc, but i played it a ton on the ps3 when i got it on there. probably at least 4000 hours+ on pc. mods: go ahead and mod everything possible. theres unlimited possiblities in the steam workshop. 10/10 the best of the decade so far. lets see if there is a game that can top this one.",1
"exellent game period! i played over 50 hours and still find new and exiting content!",1
"this game is by far the best game ever. its wayyy different to most other rpg games. its worth the money.",2
"i have so many hours in this game on pc and console, i have no idea what to write. so here is a muffin recipe. muffins ingredients 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup sugar 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 egg, beaten 3/4 cup milk 1/4 cup cooking oil directions preheat oven to 400 degrees f. grease twelve 2-1/2-inch muffin cups or line with paper bake cups; set aside. in a medium bowl combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. make a well in center of flour mixture; set aside. in another bowl combine egg, milk, and oil. add egg mixture all at once to flour mixture. stir just until moistened (batter should be lumpy). spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full. if desired, sprinkle streusel topping over muffin batter in cups. bake for 18 to 20 minutes or until golden and a wooden toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean. cool in muffin cups on a wire rack for 5 minutes. remove from muffin cups; serve warm. makes 12 muffins.",2
"this game is great by itself, but for the glorious pc master race enthusiast, the many mods available make this game even better.",1
"you will loose yourself on this one. the mood is awesome and so much fun! just care for the killer mudcrabs...",1
"even though this game is seven years old now, skyrim is still my all-time favorite rpg adventure. what it lacks in default graphics it makes up for in mods and overhauls produced by the gaming community, making your skyrim equal (if not better) to most games on the market today. as far as content goes, if youve finished every quest, explored every cave, and cleared every dungeon, then there are plenty of fantastic quest mods out there and i doubt ill get bored of skyrim any time soon. be sure to check out the skyrim nexus for the latest and greatest mods to keep your game looking fresh. sorry for the rant.",1
"overall thoughts - the legendary edition is a great deal. it is unfortunate that the game doesnt live up to what is was hyped to be. for some reason i was never able to really get into the game as others have been able to. i have played many games in this genre, but this one is particularly boring. the world is beautiful at first, but it gets very dull after about 30 minutes. the mod support for the game is great. there are alot of different mods for you to choose from if you are interested in that sort of thing. the combat is fun, but you do more running around than actual fighting. gameplay 4/10 - nothing special here. the combat is generally boring. the dragon fights are fun but far between. environment/graphics 4/10 - awe inspiring environment at first, but you will soon be fighting to stay awake in this dull, bleak, dreary environment. story 7/10 - the story is decent, all i can say really. length 8/10 - vanalia skyrim has a lot of content for you to explore. however, you might find some parts of the game repetitive and lacking creativity. mods give the game replay value which is the best aspect of this game. overall 6.5/10 - get the legendary edition because it will come with all of the dlc which will add more replay value. if you are looking for a game with a large amount of content and replay value, then this is the game for you.",1
"great game regardless, but being able to mod via the workshop makes the experience so much better and adds huge amounts of replay value.",1
"be man on horse carriage be about to be kill see dragon go tell mayor kill dragon i am dragonman",1
"what else do i have to say besides one of the most addicting games on the planet!!!!!!",3
"*warning* this game will take away months off your life and destroy your social life. *play at own risk* this game is one of the best single player rpgs ever created along with oblivion and morrowind and will offer you 5000+ hours of gameplay and community mods guarantee endless replayabilliy value. 11/10",1
"just pure amazing, i have beat the game, the dlcs, and all the side faction groups. plus being on here you can get mods to make it even better and even a better time! i do have to say though that if you get the skse laucher for it,it may mess up ur hours! i had over 400 hours, then it just started over, but i do have all the achievments so if anyone has a say in the matter; it is me. buy the game, you will love it!",1
"as i write this, only 117 hrs on record. one of the most entertaining of the elder scrolls series as far as exploring and finding new things at every turn. i still miss daggerfall (they need to bring back ships, improve spell creation, etc.) and it feels like skyrim has fewer things to loot than oblivion... but with the right mods this game is superb. id say this makes my top 10 list but with a few crippling bugs and with some need for improvement on the crafting/skill/balance area, it will stay toward the bottom of that list for now.",1
"brothers and sisters are like natural enemies, like imperials and nords or bretons and nords or argonians and nords or nords and other nords! damn nords! they ruined skyrim!",4
"finally bought game in steam, 1010 guys, the game is really awesome",1
"its like oblivion, only with beliveable characters, and a good story, and fun gameplay, and unique locations to explore, and reasonable system requirements, and all those other things they forgot to put into oblivion because they were too busy masturbating over shaders and poorly optimized textures. so its like oblivion only good.",1
"after playing this game, i now have chest hair. i would definitely recommend this game if you want to be a manly-man.",1
"took a potato from a farmer and fined 10 gold. walked into riverwood and was attacked by vampires on sight. 10/10 half eatin cookies.",1
"one of the best rpg games in the last decade. i highly reccomend :)",1

"if you havent played this game......... then what the hell is wrong with you then!!!! get the g*dd*mn money and f*cking buy it!!!!lkhefiuhighidofglksdnglkjdhgkjgnlsjdghiueg",1
"great game, even better with mods. it has a good immersive factor.",1
"if you even vaguely like rpgs, you should give skyrim a try. the scope and dangers of the game are epic, the landscapes breathtaking and unforgiving, and there is so much to do you can literally sink hundreds of hours in this game. it is also the most highly polished elder scrolls game to date, so it is an excellent starting point for beginners and series veterans will appreciate the refinements and new features. if you do not already have elder scrolls v: skyrim, you need to buy it now.",2
"highly confusing at first but when you go to 3 cities its simple (maybe not) it is the best game (fantasy) i ever played 5 stars",1
"if youve enjoyed morrowind or oblivion even a little, then this game even with its unfortunate release issues is a must-play experience.",2
"one of the best rpgs i ever played. the map is huge with thousands of quests and side quests. theres a lot of items you can get, the main story is long and epic. i strongly recommend this game to someone who wants to use a lot of time on a brilliant game.",1
"i found this game as my favorite game on steam, i thought when i picked it up that i would play it, but not as much as i have.",1
"youve ever heard the song where the chorus goes i just cant get enough, i just cant get enough? well .... this game will do just that to you.",2
"skyrim, like most games in the elder scrolls series, is a game for when you want to forget youre you for days or weeks at a time and not even feel bad when you finally return to the land of the living.",1
"this is my most played game on steam. 680 hours at the time of writing this and i havent done half of the stuff thats in this game. its rediculously nice looking, fun, and engrossing. if you get bored of it the modding community is huge. i bought it a week after release at the full $60 and it was worth every penny. the dlc is also totally worth it. best purchase on my steam account tl;dr: 10/10 its alright",3
"a classic in the making. its gorious, it plays great (melee could still use some work, but alas) and you just feel so totally immersed. and pretty much anything people dislike, such as the ui can be tweaked to taste by mods, which are pretty easy to get with the workshop.",1
"if you play this game or u are going to, you must head to workshot or nexus to waste you life! currently play it with 200+ mods and its so satisfying! the immersion,the sound, the art... everything will make you wooooow! and if you(actually you must) use mods as i said before, you can say goodbye to your life! 10/10",1
"skyrim is the last and best elder scrolls single player game ever. it has beautiful visuals and attention to detail, it is one of the most immersive games out there. you will never run out of things todo witht he games infinite quest generator, and the main story is a beautifully written one.",1
"i love this game so much!!! play it play it play it!!!",1
"it is a freerelm/campaign game. ti is one of my favorite games i have ever played",1
"it certainly is dumbing down compared with oblivion and especially morrowind, but its great if you dont want to use intelligence and just want to have fun. use an xbox controller for the best experience.",1
"if you want to play a game that has the features of a badass medieval story than this is it. with what seems like endless quests and well thoughtout and detailed strings of multiple story lines, this is by far one of the best games of all time.",1
"one of the greatest games of all time. although it is still full of bugs and glitches several years on...",1
"this game is the bane of my existance... jk i love it with all my heart and with the mod support backing it up, it may be my favorite game of all time.",3
"this game is awesome! hundreds of hours of fun! roleplaying at its best, the modding community is fantastic and there is so much to do!",2
"skyrim is the best elder scrolls game, and one of the best crpg games, to date. if you dont have it yet, do yourself a favor and get it, now.",3
"its a fun game, even better if you get a ton of mods.",1
"i have played skyrim on a couple of different platforms and its a great game. everyone knows it, however, the pc version is even better as the available mods through the steam workshop really improve the game experience. since playing the pc version i added lots and lots of mods and i have really, really, enjoyed the community content. just looking forward to elder scrolls online now!",1
"pretty much the unfinishable game that makes you want to finish it, will always be coming back to play",2
"one of my all time favourite games. really allows you to do whatever you want. the dlc really do add allot to the game.",2
"this game is amazing just by itself,and yes i do play with mods sometimes, but its still really good. ive always been a fan of the elder scrolls series and this one blew me away! the dragonborn concept is very intresting and action packed and it adds the feel that this is a real elder scrolls game. skyrim adds so many possiblities that others could not, and if you dont agree, why was this game of the year in 2011 then? i highly recommend the elder scrolls v: skyrim to any person that loves action.",1
"wonderful graphics and an in depth storyline, i love this game.",1
"this game is the bomb. 10/10 would buy this. kill dragons get money.",1
"a visually stunning game that had me wanting more.",1
"excellent game, nice graphics, a huge world to explore and a lot of quests, and for those who like, the workshop with mods to take this game even a step further. in my list of all times favourites for sure!",1
"wells there goes you weekend, and the weekend after that, and after that.........",3
"this is the best game released in 2011! i am going to easily sink hundreds of hours into this game.",2
"skyrim keep crashing,and the workshop wont showed up... skyrim with steam is a bad idea.",1
"so many hours of play and i never get bored. i dont know what is better, the story, graphics, dlc, player mods... skyrim is for those who love fantasy world but i think that no matter what you like, it will intrigue you.",3
"there is so much that can be said about tesv. though much more streamlined than its predecessors, skyrims gameplay is the most fluid of all the elder scrolls games. add to this one of the greatest modding communities in gaming, and you will never have to leave tamriel again (including to play that terrible mmo).",5
"very fun game. great with a controller for comfortable gaming.",1
"probably one of the best, if not the best, game of all time. 10/10 would bang.",1
"amazing game you wont reget buying this game, huge modding community. sure the game has bugs but can solved by using console commands",1
"awesome game! i love this. the soundtrack is awesome too.",1
"beautiful game! so many hours gameplay its unreal! the fun never ends....",1
"significanly better than previous incarnations, with the possible exception of the expansion to oblivion, which was amazing. combat tended to be a joke from the very beginning, which was a problem considering that dragons were supposed to be some kind of apocalyptic threat (i mean that was the plot, right?) and by the end of the game you were smashing them in a single blow. also, i felt some of the plot ramifications of your decisions were unrealistic and tended to punish the player for no real reason. still, these were somewhat minor flaws. i very much enjoyed the game on the whole and wholeheartedly recommend it.",2
"skyrim, where do i begin. this is the best game i have ever played in my entire life. i first purchased this on xbox 360 back when 2011 when it was released and i loved it. on the xbox 360 i have probably played over 2000 hours. i got it on pc for the mods and i still love it. if you want to make a character to be evil, good or better yet act like a jester throughout skyrim. it is completly your choice and thats one of the big features about skyrim. this game brings you back all the time begging you to play it. this game normal (no mods) is just lovely. the graphics are stunning and will blow you away with some of the sceneries. i would highly recommend this game. that why im giving it a 10/10.",1
"now initaly skyrim can be a kinda good game, but with mods you can fix gliches,spawn bears with lutes,improve graphics and gamplay and get awsome house and make it a more imersive game so it can realy depend wether you use mods or not.plus it has awsome dlc but that will be anuther review.ehter way you should get it if you like free-rome rpgs normal skyrim 6/10 moded skyrim 8/10 i used to be an adventurer like you, then i took an arrow in the knee.",1
"first elder scrolls ive ever played and loved every minute of it, fantastic game",1
"this game i would give a 5/10 but with the mod id give it a 6/10. i love tes always have especaly oblivion but skyrim let me down, been on and off this game or a fews year trying to find the love that i have for oblivion but it just didnt happen. i would recommend getting oblivion game of the year edition, unless boaring main questline, loss of dark atmosphere and having more mods on than a airsofters primary intestest you.",1
"if you enjoy killing mythical and non-mythical creatures, raiding towns, killing bandits, and having an array of weapons. buy this game",2
"where do i begin for a fps/racing guy i love this rpg",1
"its skyrim! need anyone say more. you can always find yourself coming back for more. even after beating the game 5 times over i am still doing stuff differently. great investment; a lot of bang for your digital buck.",1
"amazing game. had it since its release date. best game i have ever play on pc. need i say anymore?",1
"the elder scrolls has always been one of my favorite series of games!! this one is awesome to say the least!! highly reccomended to anyone who likes a hack and slash rpg!!",1
"this game doesnt even need a review, its absolutely beautiful and amazing.",1
"the elderscrolls v skyrim is one of the bests i have ever played, the open world experience is amazing and the ai is okay. sometimes quests can be buggy but i still play the game, so when you play skyrim praise talos kids.",1
"skyrim allows you to live another life in another world, filled with mystical creatures and eye-popping visuals. hours upon hours of adventures await, with endless ways to play in any style you choose. feel free to do whatever you want in the game. be a hero, or a villain, or a farmer, or a silent assassin. whatever you want to be you can be. i highly recommend skyrim, as well as its predecessors the elder scrolls iii & iv: morrowind and oblivion, respectively.",1
"its a good open world game with lots of mods available.",2
"skyrim carries a promise of wealth, glory, large houses, odd jarls, somewhat insane assassins, men who worship dragons, snoody gaurds, insane gods, staffs that turn poeple into chickens, demons who challenge you to drinking contests, entire guilds of werewolves, and best of all: sweet rolls",2
"beautiful highly realistic graphics, smooth gameplay and enjoyable quests truly makes the elder scrolls v: skyrim the game to beat.",1
"what can i say? such a fantastic rpg, the best of the elderscrolls series to date as far as open world questing goes and plenty of variety to it.",1
"theres lots of stuff to do in this game and the best part of you can do it your way, what i mean by you way is you can create your one followers, create/modify your armor and weapons and ect... . i recommend this game to anyone who craves creativity.",1
"the sequel we all hoped for. set in the beautiful, frozen, frigid north lands, in the same world as previous titles morrowind and oblivion. the player takes the role of a hero known as the dragonborn, a warrior with the body of a mortal but the soul of a dragon, whose destiny it is to destroy a great evil! that being said the game lends its self to moral ambiguity quite well. the player being able kill or help pretty much whoever he wishes, with your actions actually having an impact as you mold the world around you with your decision or indecision - this is of course the holy grail of any open world fantasy epic. a hardcore rpger wont enjoy that turning down missions your charcter wouldnt take on his chosen path of morality can cause you to miss out on some fun parts of the game. but hey! maybe try a second play through as a bad guy! skyrim really ticks almost all of the rpg boxes, want to fight dragons? demons? join a clan of wearwolves? maybe your prefer vampires? no problem! you want to be a career criminal? assasin? hunter? get married and build your own house? its literally all in here. with over 400 hours of game time so far i am still finding new areas, quests and things to explore. throw the workshop mods into the mix and this is a must have game that i believe will come to be regarded as a classic.",2
"this is an awsome game. hours of things to do and see! well worth the price.",1
"every one should play this game,but dont use i has a -ton of errors steam workshop! use nexus mod manager and go to the skyrim nexus at:",1
"summery in a few words - the best elder scrolls to date. even those who loved morrowind and liked oblivion will love this one. though some pc specific ui would have been nice. like implementation of hotkeys. still the sheer number of content will surprise you....... guarantee",1
"you will have no trouble dedicating many hours to this game. it does not get old, and mechanics never seem too repetitive or boring. with an insane amount of quests, a massive world, and seemingly endless dungeons, this game will give you plenty of gameplay, and it gets cheaper every year!",1
"when the game first came out i must have stayed home for about a month playing this game all day long. its super addictive. not to mention the thousands of free mods.",2
"beautiful graphics, excellent gameplay, unforgettable musics, infinite mods, appealing characters, an incredible story and the dovahkiin !! i will never forget this amazing game. this is skyrim. best. game. ever. .. wh.. what ? you didnt buy it ? go :d",2
"i dont always get an arrow in the knee.....but when i do i turn into a werewolf.",3
"this game is pretty fun but not superduper fun and it crashes randomly.",1
"a great game, a must addition to the game collection.",3
"great game, pales in comparison to oblivion though.",3
"as good as an elder scrolls game is supposed to be!",1
"the best game ever!!!!!! belin una figata totale!!! :)",2
"this game is absolutely amazing. it is a game that i can get totally immersed in, and then after several hundred hours of gameplay, i can mod it to make it feel completely new to me. i whole-heartedly recommend this game to everyone!!!",2
"every rpg fans have to play this game. modding is also the best way to experimenting any elder scrolls games so dont do one without the other.",2
"best modabel open world rpg ever. i spent hours playing and i havent seen it all (and i dont have any dlcs yet) so if you like to use mods its this game is awesome. for modding beginners, like i was, i can recommend the website skyrim nexus. they offer a mod manger which makes it easy to mod the game.",1
"not the best elder scrolls game ive played but still by far one of my favorite rpgs.",2
"i have definitely enjoyed this game, and i would recommend it to others, especially with the wonderful mods available. i have spent many, many hours playing, and i plan to throw some more time into it once life calms down a little.",2
"my favorite game of all time, beautiful is every aspect. excellent graphics, gameplay, freedom, story and mods. this game has no end, only a beginning. 10/10 must have.",1
"a very large fantastic experience, especially if you mods it with great things like brighter water, dragon souls for perks and more armors/weapons from the lotr (etc.)",2
"great game for moding and great game not moding. it your chose.",1
"i shouted at a chicken and all nine holds had put a 10000 gold bounty on me. 10/10, would fus ro dah again",1
"this game is one of the best i have ever played. very well designed, and endless hours of playtime.",1
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"i belive that skyrim is litteraly the best role playing game evermade. if if you dont own skyrim or you have never played it i think that you should buy it so that you (and possibly your children) can play it for the rest of your natual born life. i hope that one day everyone will know the dovahkiin (dragonborn) and the many different versions of his story.",1
"if youre into rpg, i strongly recommend this masterpiece of a game.",3
"one of the best games i ever played . a must try game that every one needs to play but buy it with sales",1
"an amazing expansive game filled with things to do and places to explore. many of the problems to be had with this game, ui for example can be fixed with some of the numerous mods available over on the steam workshop. you owe it to yourself to get this game",1
"so my original review of the majestic fifth installment of buthesduhs aaa hiking simulator series was, ing combat qtes!!!!!! which still holds true. oh well you have to deal with it i guess rite? some good things have been patched into the game like the infinite dragons can now fly backwards and also the game ctds a lot but its okay if you run 3 save + an autosave files like a bro. the game world is huge and there are 57,612 quests (yeah i counted( but there is no c&c to be had you either do quest like they say or u just leave it in your log like a quitter and quitters never win. tbh i have a lot of gripes about this game andf i wish it were a lot better than how it turned out and it is incredibly short sighted and frustrating at times but you know i still played it for over 100 hours final rating 11/10.",1
"i played this game for 2 days non-stop. no sleep. but i think, worth it.",1
"lots of fun, endless replay value with various mods.",3
"with all the mods from the skyrim nexus you can truly make this game shine like a gem and mod it to your preferable state. lovely modding scene. the mods also add new content and weapons and armors and all, basically you can find everything, i mean everything. 5/5 with mods. 3.5/5 without mods.",1
"probably the second best game ive ever played (1st being pokemon!!)",1
"epic game. almost feels endless and with mods it can be :) would recommend this game any day, well worth the money.",1
"while i dont usually care for rpgs, especially mythical ones like final fantasy, this one has grabbed me and wont let go. it can be tedious and often overwhelming with so many things requiring attention, exploration and manipulation, but it eventually pays off in making the quests and battles more successful. so in spite of the flaws and occasional quirks, the payoff is in a whole beautiful world of scenery to explore and multitudes of quests and missions to undertake. and you can get sidekick npcs to aid you in your quests, some of who are rather attractive female warriors who wish to fight by your side and stoke your ego. oh, and you get to kill dragons! count me in!",2
"this game has provided many hours of enjoyment on pc and console. i go on terrible binges and will not stop playing for day at a time. after playing so many hours it is great to be able to add mods, some argue that mods take away from the game like when i add master chief armor, but there are thousands of lore friendly mods that will increase the game play. this game is a must play for anyone who loves rpgs. the base game has hundreds of hours of content and will always keep you very busy.",1
"i love the exploration in this game, but bethesda just doesnt seem to invest enough time in their games. the biggest lack is the poor npc interaction, too many fetch quests, lack of impact of your actions on the world, and especially your overpoweredness after a while. especially when they want to make a realistic fantasy enviroment, please dont make the character so overpowered, and the hp of the ennemies is just over the top high. bashing ten thousand times at an ennemy is really annoying, and especially the outdated meele system should be improved. the player just doesnt seem to be involved in the world too much. the game is just spamming stuff whitout actually making it really good. sure it has nice graphics, great world, a good leveling up system and such, and i really think this game is very good, but it could be so much better wit one more year of development.",1
"i love these type of games! this game was made for me!!!! this is a game that is for the total nerd that loves role-playing and fantasy and making your own story. i have put over 100 hours and counting into this masterpeice of a game. its like this game was made for me!!!! for example this one day i went into solitude (one of the many cities in tamriel{the world}) and i went into a house where this kid calling out for the dark brotherhood and i accepted his quest to kill this abusive orphanige owner and i killed her and went back and claimed my prize (a ing plate) and went back to my home in whiterun ( another city ) and took a nap for the night. when i woke up though, i woke up in an abandoned cabin. there was a member of the dark brotherhood telling me to leave that i hade to kill one of the three people behind me that had a contract one their head. when i did she told me to join the dark brotherhood and i accepted ( as i wanted to be in the dark brotherhood forever) and i started a new just because i walked into a house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is what makes skyrim a perfect game!!! it... is... unscripted...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
"this game does not really need any reviews...if you have played the previous games, then why are you even reading this? go play skyrim. however if you have never played a game from the elder scrolls series then here is my extensive review that covers all you need to know : go play skyrim! 10/10",1
"enormous, detailed and living. simply one of the best games ive ever played.",2
"dovahkiin dovahkiin by his honour is sworn to keep evil forever at bay and the fiercest foes rout when they hear triumphs shout dovahkiin for your blessing we pray and the scrolls have fortold of black wings in the cold that when brothers wage war come unfurled alduin bane of kings ancient shadow unbound with a hunger to swallow the world",1
"just played this for 3 days for my blog (3 days isnt enough i know, but i have to limit myself). im posting the link to the review below, but i cant reccomend this game enough. however if you do get it, mod it. it makes the game so much better.",1
"pretty awsome game for the first few run throughs.",1
"skyrim has to be one of the very best, most immersive and over all bad  games i have ever played if youve read this please buy it your missing out without it!",1
"it has it all. open world rpg at its best. very well spent time for those who enjoy long games, rpgs and not to know where it will lead you.",1
"according to one dragon slayer: the hardest part of this game was slaying tuckers mum.",1
"simply legendary, easily 10/10 game. but... beware the glitches, or just find some unofficial patches from steam workshop to fix them.",4
"good game.... played it countless hours.... beaten it several times and completed it 100% despite the fact people say the game can not be beaten.... i say it can, since all the game does it generate random quests after you do all the main quests, all thats left is clearing out forts and such but once you clear the map 100% there is nothing left to do.... i know this because i have cleared all caves and forts.... 100% and i have not gotten anymore quests since then....",1
"ive wasted my life on this game, ps3 and pc. ive probably spent hundreds more hours modding and getting mods to work rather than playing. 10/10 would play that. its got dragons and . stole my reccomendation, bethesda pls moar.",2
"it is by far one of my favorite games of the generation. there are tons of mods for when you get bored, never ending quests. i highly recomend this game",1
"i know so many poeple that built gaming computers just to play this game on their pcs. the graphics are good, not exceptional as it it only dx9, but good. the gameplay is really good too, loads of quests to do, making weapons and a huge map to explore. you can use bow and arrows, ride horses, swords. you can get different grades like iron, steel ect each having different damage rating. you can even make potions to give yourself that extra advantage. best thing for this game would be the modification for it. there is so many mods you can get for this game it is unbeliveable. if your thinking of modding make sure you have a powerfull pc.",1
"you really need a recommendation? its an open world game about killing dragons! buy it already!",1
"awesome game with its expansions and the super duper mod support! oblivion was boring, there was something dull about it. skyrim managed to beat that. morrowind is still the best of the series imho, mostly because of the dialogue system that came with oblivion (and used in skyrim with some touches) is a bit too light. besides that, one of the best games of all time.",2
"this game is superb. a childs story book come to life, with wonderful multi-layered character drama. gameplay is challenging, but not unforgiving, and the freedom to pick your own skills lets you experiment hastle free with every type of interaction this rpg has to offer. your never locked into one style of play, or one storyline. entering many stories at once, makes it feel like youre character really lives a busy and involved life that matters. seeing many stories through to their ends, gives a sense of completion and satisfaction akin to finishing 8 other full length games. skyrim is where wonder, relaxation and excitement come together, in an almost impossible beautiful harmony. this is the current apex of interactive fantasy.",1
"one of the best rpg. you must play in this game if you fan of oblivion and morrowind.",1
"unmodded the game felt bland, ugly and pointless. modded the game was enjoyable for a while before the inevitable feeling of why am i wasting my life? set in. if you are new to bethesda wandering sims, then give it a shot, itll be cool. if you have already played morrowind, oblivion, fallout 3 and new vegas, then this is the same clunkey, poor quality combat with weird leveling for hundreds and hundreds of hours.",1
"good, but a rather large step backwards from oblivion.",2
"if you like role playing games and love killing forever re-spawning dragons and draugrs, this game is for you! also it has tons of awesome mods you can try out.",1
"excellent game, not really hardcore rpg, but still brilliant fun. get the legendary edition and add mods for a wonderful experience and much replayability.",1
"what else is there to say about skyrim that hasnt already been said multiple times by anyone who has ever played it (or any other game in the franchise for that matter). stunning visuals, superb gameplay, and having a quest log that is usually topped to the brim with stuff to do makes this game a definate for any person interested in a game that can easily give you 75+ hours of solid gameplay.",1
"simply the best rpg ever. the scale of the game world is immense and its open world nature allows you to either follow the core story or simply go walkabout and never feel as if you are missing out on anything. as if the vanilla game isnt enough there is a vibrant modding community allowing you to extend the game and provide enough content to keep you coming back for more for a long, long time.",2
"if you are into rpg/frp games and you want to be inside the game as yourself instead of seeing the character from up top, and of course you dont like team play, this is the one for you. in fact play the entire series of elders scrolls from the beginning, my recommendation would be to play at least morrowind and oblivion first then move on to this one, youll get the stories and place names better plus the story lines are loosely connected.",1
"good game skyrim is cool i bought the dlc this game is rated for me 9/10",1
"the only reason i have not recommended this yet is because i have been playing it non-stop since release. it is amazing.",3
"i am not sure why i am posting a review. besides the bugs, this is an awesome game! for example, i went to a tavern and came upon a guy who challenged me to a drinking contest. apparently, i got so drunk that i travelled all the way to the other side of the country, defiled a temple, and was forced to pick up after myself (but not before getting caught stealing from said temple and being charged with a quest to bring their ward). i step outside and i am immediately attacked by a dragon. such is the life in skyrim.",3
"i have played through this game on my xbox and playstation and still had enough love to play through it again on my pc. this game has excellent graphics and a well devolped story. there is much more for you to do in the game even after you have beaten the game. i would definatley recommend this game for anyone who wants to play a fantastic story and who has tons of time on their hands because it will suck you in.",1
"youll be really impressed with the enormous world at first. but by absence of a great overall story and interesting npcs the game itself gets pretty monotonous and pointless after a while. it looks great, though pure game fun is far to be found. if you like rpgs, youre better of with other excellent recent titles like xenoblade chronicles.",1
"took about two days to get 30 hours of play, that gives you an idea of what i think of this game. and in that 30 hours i have only spent two hours of doing the main storyline. i wish i got this game sooner. 9/10",2
"amazing rpg, extremely creative and its worth every cent!!!",1
"great game hunders of hours and quests, a must have",2
"its as great game, i had it for xbox and i never thought it would work on my pc... until now! although the graphics are on low they are by far the best graphics ive ever seen on a game (for xbox or pc). a must buy, especially at that price 11/10",1
"i highly reccomend this game. skyrim has a great background and so many things to do. :3",1
"a game that i enjoy each time i play through, very fun and engaging world and interesting characters and plot overall one of my prefered games to play at any time and is in my top ten games of all time truely worth playing",2
"skyrim, making giants follow you into the mountains so that you can shout them off. 10/10",1
"i know im a couple of years late to the party, but this game is definitely worth the money.",1
"this game is not for people who do not want to take the time in a very detailed rpg, yet this game is one of the best ive seen in a very long time and anyone who is a fan of complicated games such as this should put some money down and try it out for themselfs.",1
"great game with awesome mods i rate it ten out of ten its worth the money but its a heavy game not best for old and light computers.",1
"one of the joyable rpgs ive played and cant wait for elder scrolls online, and all the expansions for skyrim along with the mods; off steam and nexus make it even more fun.",1
"..............................................10/10.................................................. obviously this game has been reviewed to death but i am going to throw my hat in the rink..... i think the only thing i need to say about this game is that i have sunk countless hundreds of hours into this game, across multiple platforms and i dont even know if i have scratched the surface. every time it seems like an all new adventure... the graphics are incredible, especially for such a gargantuan game. the story is too cool!!!! i have never had soooo much fun crafting, brewing, making random things and wandering aimlessly...... this game was a monumental undertaking from bethesda and they did not disappoint one bit... i am amazed at the finished product, polished or not!!",1
"great game! many hours spent exploring and killing dragons! also sneaking around and sneakily killing everyone possible..recommend to everyone to purchase and play. you will not ever put it down!",1
"one of the best games ever made. you like story? exploration? decision making? mods? then this game is for you, its amazing the experience you can have with this game.",1
"big story, big environment, big fights, not enough time!",1
"currently my favorite and most played game, skyrim is a great way to spend time with friends and family or just by yourself. you can go into it not playing any of the other games and still get the concept. from the gameplay to the graphics this is definitly worth your money. with definitly +100 hours of gameplay ready to go. not to mention the dragons are ing badass!",1
"after slaying almost every npc with my bare hands, witnessing dragons in wrestler suits, sending an avalanche of cabbage down the throat of the world, riding a 200 metre tall horse through whiterun and spending a posh evening with a bunch of mudcrabs wearing tophats and monocles i can finally say that im done with this game.",1
"very great, you can go any path you want unlike most games and still have a heavy action adventure! theres so much to do, i never get bored",1
"awesome game! althoug, it gets a little repetitive over time.",1
"theres always something to do in this epic game, just riding your horse and look around is amazing. the main quest is really cool, yet its just a tiny piece of the game. one does not simply finish skyrim! i cant write everything, its seriously so much to know. to make it as short as possible; if you like to slay dragons and other evil creatures, look like a badass, help people with all sorts of tasks and travel through beautiful landscapes and scary dungeons, you have to play this game.",1
"a phenomenal game. so deep and rich, meaning an immersive and long-lived experience. a game i will keep coming back to.",1
"this game is really fun to play, it looks really nice and there is so much to do in skyrim even after the main quest!",1
"sometimes one needs to skyrim the whole night. -chez242121",1
"got this at the midnight release, became so addicted i missed my finales that semester. no regrets what so ever. 15/10 (btw mod the s**t out of it)",2
"90% of the props should go to the modding community instead of bethesda. that being said, be sure youve got yourself some disc space.",1
"one of the best games ever! it is what you want in every rpg, especially with the steam workshop for added content. this is one game i am glad to say i wasted my days on. this is in my top ten games of all time. get this game and the dlc and you will not regret it. why are you still reading this go buy the game already!",2
"an amazing game, so much so that i bought it for pc too (i own it on xbox 360 with 500+hours). i would seriously recommend this game to any avid rpg fan, it has a rich lore which will keep you entertained for hours on end.",1
"pretty damned close to perfection. id place new vegas just a squeak ahead because fallout, but skyrim actually does some mechanics better. the only complaint id have is how easy it is to fall into the sneak and archery route. gorgeous, inviting, involving, and endless. a joy every gamer should experience.",2
"prepare to lose yourself in this imense experience.",1
"great game cant recommend it enough and with all the mods made by the community its never gonna end up dull like the console version 10/10",1
"i love this game 10/10 my favorite game of all time!!!!",1
"thanks to steam workshop and nexus mods, skyrim will never grow old!",1
"this game is literally a high end software game. it was fun when the loading screen didnt take ten minutes for small places! get some really good software if you plan to get the dlcs or your looking at long loading screens. but, this is a really good game to not lie. its got a short main questline. but it does make up for it by having so many quests. the reason i bought this was for nolgastia. i miss playing morrowind.",1
"i thought id edit this review after something like 500 hrs of gameplay and about 6 different character builds to date. by far the greatest open ended adventure/rpg game i have played, i have been compelled to return to skyrim every couple of months, and each time, i have a different experience, i discover new places. the mods created by the skyrim community are what really give this game an edge, with new armors and weapons, better visuals, new quests, new lands, new companions, and overall gameplay improvements and bug fixes, the mods have made this game even better than it was 2 years ago. so go visit skyrim and you can do the following: kill some dragons, climb to the highest peak and stare at a sunset, hunt some deer or rabbit, find all the dragon priest masks, master the conjuration skill or the sneak skill, become a vampire, ask lydia what a thane is over and over again.",2
"more addictive then second life, and i love second life!!!",2
"i would go as far as to say that this is the greatest game i have ever played. by the way... fus ro dah",1
"if you dont have this game.... whats wrong with you",1
"awesome game, youll beat it once, and just keep playing afterwards",1
"playing on keyboard sucks. mouse to sensitive.otherwise great game . graphics are good having fun.",1
"you dont even need to see this. youve already made up your mind about this game. admit it. fine, i suppose ill make a review. so, skyrim. not many games like this, since theres steps from breathing fire onto a dragon and cooking a soup. huh. so, its the 5th in the franchise of games ive never played, and i must admit. i really really like it. its pretty. good. yeah. recommended. gameplay mechanics. waving a sword in a enemies face waiting for them to bleed tomato juice. fabulous. or for them to get smashed in the back of the head by a bear. always nice.",2
"yes just yes, the mods avalable for this game fix all the bugs and add everything you could ever think of and more!!!!",1
"best game ive ever played. fun, long story, lot of quests. lot of playing time, for good money. i recommend this",1
"i highly reccomend this electronic landscape simulator",2
"i started playing in 20:00 pm . i stole a horse and went to jail. i jailbreaked and started killing s*it and geting killed. then i repeated last two steps until i got bored in 01:00 am. waited 20:00 pm and repeated all the steps above. 10/10 would steal the horse again. ony reason i wouldnt recommend this game is that its addictive like crack heroin weed and every other drug there is. the elder scrolls v: skyrim not even once update: became an regular alcoholic after finding out i could have bought the game for half of price if i waited and also buy fallout: las vegas 10/10 would get hangover again",1
"i got hit by a mammoth and it broke the theives guild questline. 12/10 would buy horse and have it die 5 seconds later again.",2
"its a great game and ive already put 40+ hours into the game and im still going strong with exploring.",1
"this is mucj better on pc. i originally have this game on ps3, but i was curious about the mods. i definetly recommend this game to anybody. try to get it on a sale i got mine for 7.50. sorry for bad spellling",1
"crazy fun, but dont buy if you are crunched for time. time disapears while you play.",1
"this game speaks for itself. epic, fun, entertaining, and ever-changing with brilliant mods made by brilliant people. a must-have! ive put some ridiculous gaming time into this and am still finding new things to do all the time! and ive had more fun doing all of the side quests more than the main stuff! its just the way the sweet roll rolls in this gigantic fantasy world :d",2
"if you like the elder scrolls series you will love the new upgrades. plus mod support this game is epic. obviously you need to have the expansions for full experiance and modding is definately recommended",1
"grat story and gameplay, on lower detail runs smoothly even on low-end notebooks, dynamic environment and houndreds of hours of gameplay",1
"redistributing arrows has never been quite so much fun.",1
"this is the worst game ive ever had the displeasure of playing. the only redeeming quality of it are the user made mods , without them i would rate it a 3/10.",1
"one of the biggest games ive ever played. with over 100 hours of gameplay possible, along with the steam workshop mods, skyrim is well worth the price.",1
"what can i say you can honestly do and be whatever you want in this game plus dragons",2
"this game is a 1337 game that is powered on deditaded wam and redbull. buy now!",1
"not the best game i ever played, but the funniest, almost 700 hours and 5 playthrough and ofcours mods, there are no reason not to get this game.",3
"skyrim is an amazing game. there are many great aspects, like the enormous world or the variety of options of who to talk to, what to do, who to kill, and much more. skyrim is definitely worth the $19.99",1
"i can be a cat that has a heart of a dragon. 10/10",1
"good for around 20 hours and then you get bored and start modding it. modding becomes a better part of the game. play about with mods for more hours than you actually played the quest lines. screenshot everything. break your game with mods. play another game.",1
"i was willing to spend 400 hours playing this game, and willing to spend 400 more hours just to explore the diverse, and beautiful world of skyrim!",2
"this game was awesome enough to take 160 hours of my life in under 4 weeks.",1
">murdered nazeem in the middle of town >carried him up to the cloud district >threw his corpse down into some nearby water >retrieved his corpse >carried him back to the middle of town >guards see me, dont care >left nazeems corpse bent over a well >guard hard staring me whole time >decide to leave market place >accidentally hit e while looking at tomato >get sent to jail for stealing tomato 10/10",1
"great game though the command codes can make or break the game for you though. be sure to go to the workshop there is a lot of great additions to the game to improve the overall experience of this game. this is a classic and i can see my self playing this game for a very long time.",1
"this review is late to the party, but this game is still as relevant as ever. my first playthrough totaled over 100 hours.. great open world, tons of main and side quests, interesting npcs, and mods...... oh lord the mods make this game amazing. if you like the fantasy genre and are into free to roam open worlds then please give skyrim a try!",1
"it`s a great action/adventure game.i recomand to buy legendary edition because dlcs are such expensive and if u buy legendary you will have all(allmost 45e dlcs)and legendary is 39.99e it`s great!!!",1
"boring . havent been able to shoot anything after 1.8 hours. boring.",1
"love this game. ive always been a fan of the elder scrolls series and they didnt disappoint on this game.",1
"been there, done that. but i still havent had enough! the elder scrolls v: skyrim is my very first tes game i have played and i love it. i remember playing world of warcraft ( yes, sue me ) around 2012(?) if my memory serves me right, and reading on guild chat saying about how tes v: skyrim was coming out soon and it peeked my intrest upon hearing it to be an open world rpg. there surely are others of such, but something about this game simply drew my attention regardless of being oblivious to the existence of the franchises or at least hardly being interested in it, but when seeing it being played and the glorious moment of taking my first step in tamriel, in skyrim ( though i was actually just sitting on the caravan, getting ready for execution ), i knew an epic adventure was awaiting me and still to this day, i have yet to have come to the day when i must recive an arrow to my knee and retire. *shot for the joke* anyway.. besides wow, this game is my most longest played game ever... well actually sc1 and wc3 belong in that as well, but thats already going off topic. recommend? yes!",2
"this was ome of the games i upgraded my pc to play, having wasted days of my life to the xbox versiion. which does not even hold a candle to this . the base game is brilliant the dlc is good but its the mods that make this game a keeper and truly add to its replability if you dont own this, you should .",1
"if you find the tought of having free time scary this will soon put an end to that",1
"ive played this game on ps3 and xbox360 now that i own it on steam i love the fact i can play it anywhere .",1
"highly addictive and indepth, only complaint is that i cannot craft arrows.",1
"this is definitely goty 2011 material. have put in over 100 hours in the open world and still havent seen everything. the only downside is the whole arrow to the knee meme that it generated. other than that, id highly recommend it to anyone but peta members.",1
"oblivion was the personifcation of an rpg. skyrim takes the crown of undisputed rpg heavyweight for the next few years. unsuprassed excellence, replayability and near perfection with endless plethora of mods to hone and tweak your game. better or equal to dark souls: prepare to die edition until tes vi arrives...",2
"it is hard to hold a candle to the hard work and dedication put into the massive array of content within skyrim by bethesda. if you ever want to play a game that has so much content that it would take hundreds if not thousands of hours to experience it all, while still having the capability of updated by the community, and turning out ot be one of the greatest gameplay experiences of all time, skyrim is your game.",1
"vanilla version of skyrim is pretty meh after first walkthrough, but with a little help from nexus forums modding community and nmm (nexus mod manager), this is one of the best games ive ever played. i recommend modding, it really makes skyrim completely different gaming experience!",2
"very good game, and theres a lot of things to do in skyrim (and a lot of people to talk!). be patience and explore this extensive game.",1
"being a person that really doesnt play these kinds of games with dates set in the past and swords, magic and everything, this has to be one of the best games that ive ever played and will continue to play. i usually play this game when i am bored or have nothing to do, but in the time i have on it. its fun weither i have lots of hours and am a pro or not. 20/10",1
"i bought the legendary edition (with all dlc) when it was 40% off, and im not sorry. the game is just great. it has great replay value, so you can play it over and over again, you can be the character you want to be with almost no limitations. wanna be a ranger? sure! wanna be a warrior vampire? you got it! dlc and mods. my god the mods.they will expand the experience with new weapons, graphical enhancements, armor, quests, locations, cities, activities and more! get this game! i command you!",1
"ah skyrim, youre that one rpg game i keep returning to (i had it on the 360 first in 2011 before i got the pc version last year, so yes i have spent a fair amount of time on this game. just figured id point that out in case some  hat says, you only have 25 hours on the game!!! you havent even played it much !!@@@!@#$#$@#$%) back to the review. this game is unlike any other. there is literally so much you can do in this game and its addictive as hell, plus on the pc version of the game you can mod the ever living  out of it. mods that add to the core game, or mods that enhance the graphics by a bunch. i dont really like making long reviews, but i will say this. if you love rpgs or if you want to get into rpgs. get this damn game! it is worth every penny!",1
"after first 20 hours you will realize this game is excactly the same stuff... just go, explore (same caverns), kill, wow dragon, kill, try to steal something and sell it to a random guy, then repeat all. it can get interesting with some mods, but it can get buggy as well. only if you have a lot of time to waste.otherwhise go for the elder scrolls oblivion.",1
"th!s game !s the game of all games top notch well recommend this to any rpg fan!",1
"one of best games ive played placed countless hours",1
"if i had a better computer i could enjoi this game even more then i already do. if you dont buy it during a summer sale you are an idiot that smells like other idiots",1
"probably my favorite souls game to date. im so proud that as gamers we have someone as brilliant as miyamoto musashi working for fromsoftwares a+ team. the lore is so amazing u wont even believe it source: wikipedia, my dad, musashi miyamoto (american name: miyamot musashi miyazaki)",1
"i love the game skyrim. the graphics are breathtaking, the main storyline is amazing and all the other questlines are fantastic as well. there is so much you can do, and with the ability to add on mods in the workshop, it gets even better. what are you waiting for? come join us in tamriel, and may the gods watch over your battles friend.",2
"well worth all of the money and time i have spent on this game. graphics are great too.",1
"why are you reading skyrim reviews in 2014? havent you heard enough about it yet?",1
"great, vast world that really feels alive, the world of skyrim is so big and there is so much to do you can spend hours upon hours in this game. if youre into rpgs this is a must play!",1
"i think skyrim is a pretty cool guy. eh kills dragons and doesnt afraid of anything.",1
"my review for this game is that is a fantastic rpg-free world game and one of if not the best game bethesda has ever released my opinion of course. this game is one of my favourite games besides aoe (age of empires) and its dlcs (downloadable content) have made it even better exept for the occasional vampire attack an the death of important npcs like alvor,belethor (although hes very annoying) and adrianne. the mods people create for the game are what make up the bulk ofthe fun and gameplay shoutouts to the better hunting prices mod and the craftable guns mod and the deacons dark brotherhood weapons and armor mod .for this game i give it a 4.9 star",1
"its like a hiking simulator, with dragons, monsters, swords and magic.",1
"unbelievable game cant stop playing it. definately reccomended",1
"subtract everything you hate about past elder scrolls games, add everything you love, add a better engine that does not crash on you every 10 minutes and is not a steaming pile of bugs, pretty up everything, make the faces cooler and make just about everything better and you have skyrim. also, if you really want to complain about the crappy interface of how you painfully select everything and how its built for a controller, do one of the two following things : get a mod, or use a controller, we all have usb ports!",1
"this game is great. worth buying for any fan of rpg games.",2

"i know this game has been out for quite a while now, so ill keep it short and simple: skyrim is just what everyone said it was- one of the greatest rpgs of all time. the gameplay is fun and easy to pick up, the characters and lore are deep, and the surrounding envioments are astonishingly beautiful. the only problem i found with the game is that i never really felt immersed in some parts of the story. im not sure why it is, and perhapps its just me, but during some of the quests, it felt to me like the main character was either getting too much of the storys focus, or not enough, and it either of took some of the epic scale from the adventures hero/heroine and passed it on to a side character, or completely overshadowed the story itself just to get on to the gameplay, almost like it couldnt keep focus on what the premise set the plot up to be- not enjoyable or uninteresting, just not well focused. however, where skyrim doesnt have the most solid story, it makes up for it in every other department. if you dont i have this game, i fully reccomend it.",1
"obviously, the moded version is the best rpg ever.",3
"killed a chicken, talos smited me to the ground. 10/10",1
"i love this game and with all the extra workshop and player created content i feel like ill never finish it.",1
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"killed an old woman. stole a plate. got arrested. (because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"the best game storyline if to compare with fallout new vegas and deus ex hr. although the quests are so many, i meant so so many and sometimes annoying, the game never fails to impress.",2
"i... i have a problem...i have rarely strayed from skyrim since its release... ill dabble in other games like assassins creed... deadpool... civ v... but i always came back to skyrim... i dont know what it is. the seemingly endless quests? the rich environment? the deep character building? maybe its because ive only recently transfered from xbox to pc and have discovered the mounds of new content from mods... all i know is this game has been built upon by some great developers and it can be a mod as small as a few new hairstyles all the way to the enhanced weather mods. im in love and i dont care who knows! ^_^",1
"better than daggerfall. the most enjoyable fantasy simulator on the market.",1
"the best occidental rpg so far, incredibly gorgeous and rich.",1
"this game is probably one of my all-time favourites. never gets old.",1
"go and buy it now just do it, its my favourite game of all time. i have it on ps3 and ive completed it several times and i bought it again to play with mods. i have spent months and months of my life playing each race levelling up each skill tree and i do not regret my decision at all best game of all time in my opinion.",1
"extremely awesome. this game provides hundreds of hours of fun with its huge world and its amazing main and side quest lines. the modding community for this game is super active as well, so youll never run out of new things! one of the best games i ever played. 10/10. buy it, its worth it!",1
"how i play skyrim ? 50% focused on quests and 50% on mods. buy buy buy it now. or rather wait for it to be on sale.",1
"played this game over and over and it never gets old! must buy",2
"if you havent played it already, theres no need for further speculation. best rpg in the milky way, period.",1
"this game is awesome, you never complete the game.but it would be nice if it where some more funny quests",3
"i must have played through this game 4 times before on my xbox, and brothers account. i recently got it on steam again for myself, and within a few days, racked up 40 hours. its rare that a game can keep pulling you back in, especially when its a single player game. the modding community kept the game alive, too. i absolutely reccomend the game.",1
"just perfect. so open and so many choices i cant seem to stop restarting the game with new characters.",2
"walked into riverwood killed a chicken big mistake",1
"what can i say its elder scrolls other than buy it and try it, and youll be hooked love this game.",1
"a game where trying to interact with giants holding clubs turns into the funding of nasas space program.",1
"i never played skyrim up until recently, but did i make the right choice buying it. brings back memories of oblivion! :d 9/10",1
"i am forever a fan of this franchise. i never played the previous games, but jumping right into this one, i was immediately immersed in the world. the mods available today, even without enb, make the game look like it was released just yesterday. performance friendly mods even exist. the game always has something to do and if you enjoy exploring and enjoying the world in which you are emersed and having a free scneario to do anything you please, this game always delivers, and the franchise will go down as one of my all time favorites.",3
"i love love love this. this game is so fun. ive gotten to some points where i just like to wander around in the wild. its so fun. i feel like im participating. people know me. there is a glitch where the guards continuouslly attack you. if this happens, leave the room, draw your weapon, and holster it again, until they stop attacking you. if all else fails get away and wait three days. itll cool down. the holstering trick only works if you are going through a door that loads an area. a new guard will see you and ask you to pay the fine.",1
"this is by far one of the best rpgs ever made, and getting it on pc is hands down the best choice, there are so many amazing mods that you can turn it into a whole new game 10/10",2
"good but................ it does not let me play it which mean its crap it opens then shuts all the time so ;[",1
"personal rating: 9 of 10 one of the best game of the year. great story, awesome graphics fantastic gameplay, tonnes of sub quests and execellent mod community. given there are bugs here and there and that is my only beef with the game but most of the bugs can be resolve in the unofficial mod. if you are a fan of rpg games this is a must have!",2
"one of the best games ever made, get it if you have a spare 15 quid.",1
"a fantastic game. the graphics are amazing the story line is incredible this is one of the greatest games for the amount of money i spent on it which was 15. the amount of time you can spend playing this game and the amount of work put into it is insane and it was only 15. buy this game.",1
"absolutely brilliant. even 3 years later. a true masterpeice.",1
"its like a first person zelda that decided to be emo. 9.5/10 stars.",1
"one of the greatest games of the 7th generation and an all time classic. countless hours of exploration and fun awaits.",1
"this game is so excellent that i dont even feel worthy enough to review it. suffice it to say that the bar in terms of role playing games is just a plaything for bethesda game studios. they can put it wherever they want and it will stay there until they come back for it again. nobody else will even come close.",1
"this is a pretty good game. i might edit this review to not be only an achievement holder, later.",2
"no matter how long this game has been out, i can always pick it up and spend hours playing it. it never gets old, and now that i have it on pc its even better. exploring skyrim with the fan made mods from the steam workshop makes it a whole new game!",1
"skyrim is a great game with amazing quests/stories. also the amount the mods available adds so much more to the game after youve beat the main game, and the dlcs.",1
"i spent more time tweaking than i did playing, but with bethesda you know exactly what youre getting: a moddable, fairly cutting edge open world adventure slash loot crawl. pity the engine still has so many deficiencies, but you cannot deny the staying power of bethesdas formula. skyrim is still a great game, even though weve seen this exact same game at least 5 times in the last 10 years (fo3, fonv, es3, es4, est5). who cares. its still fun to drag vilja into the wilderness and laugh as she gets eaten by wild dogs.",1
"this game is great for people who are looking for a good way to pass a few hours as you can explore the vast area of skyrim as well as slay dragons, get better equipment or if youre in the mood kill inicent people that live in the citys",1
"together with batman arkham city the best game i have ever played, you can be anything, from an assassin to a madman. the world is gigantic and beautiful, the questline is epic and the sidequests are too. there is no reason not to have this game, so either when its on sale or not, buy it! 10/10",2
"its very rare to find people that dislike this game, not trying to sound hush but if you dislike a true master art piece like this, then you most likely have bad taste in games, what ever you dislike about this, the game will most likely have 70% of mods to fix your problem in this. what not to like in this, freedom of exploring, quest, treasure hunting, anything you want, but this is game is not about doing what you want but living a life as a medieval style chracter.i will admit this game had a tons of bugs needed to be fix and still have some but not much to be notice any more but other thne that this game is almost perfect, this game is just to impossiable to hate and dislike, try it out, download mods and enjoy, for you people that dislike it, try giving it out shout to it agian with the dlc and mods, you may see that its not bad as u think it is.",2
"you can get naked and murder everyone in a village. sometimes, there are bunnies that run around, they are cute. you also will spend a lot of time running around picking flowers and catching butterflies. 10/10",3
"personally, i think this is the best elder scrolls title yet.",1
"an epic rpg and the latest addition to the elder scrolls, skyrim is one good game! all i can possibly say to explain its awesomeness is: (in the words of taketherisk) youre a fool if you dont have this seriously though, get this game.",1

"it is the best rpg. play at your own risk ma contain awsomeness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"pros: story/guild branches, magic system, open world, quest variety, graphics cons: bugs (ctd, graphical glitches), limited spell selection this is, in short, the best rpg ive played. for those unaccustomed to elder scrolls games: huge world, lots of character options & skills, epic story, great graphics, awesome community mods. skyrim is a continuation of this trend, but better than morrowind [and oblivion]. for those who love morrowind as much as i do: skyrim is a bit better, it really is. ai is better, magic is infinitely more awesome, companions!, dragon fights, voice acting, etc. i expect great things when the construction kit is released. -- my roommates also a huge morrowind fan, and he loves this. we have radically different playstyles, and the great thing about skyrim: they both work. weve each spent ~70 hours in-game so far. (sorry, daggerfall crashed too much back in ye olden times for me to play it substantially) this is the best game ive ever played.",1
"good time killer and the base game does well enough. but if you want to get everything you can out of this game, prepare to mod it a fair bit for the experience you want. otherwise, you might as well get it on console.",1
"this is one of my all time favorite games. there is almost an infinite amount of things you can do with hundrends of hours of playtime. i would recomened this to anyone with even a slight intrest in these kind of games.",2
"best damn game ever damn made! there can be only one and this is the one! this is....the prize!",2

"awesome way to spend your free hours...and the hours youre supposed to be at work!!",1
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim, what could i say about this fantastic game! as always bethesda has give us a masterpiece of a game, bethesda is used to make high detailed open world rpg games, following fallout 3 from 2008 with the open world high detail terain they did it again, but in a much larger world with much more stuff to explore, tod howard is a genious... the story is great, some kind of fetish for prisoners is what bethesda loves, but the whole game is unbeatable, even after you finish the game and start all over again you will find something new, random events are great, so it gives you planty of side quests, apsolutly an amazing game, 9.5/10",1
"100% replayability even after 10 years to come !! you wont bored to death rumraging across skyrim !! massive multiple story creation with endless sidequest !! plus superb character/item creations !! +1 must have for your library",1

"spent last 14 hours modding the game, most fun i had in recent months. recommended! wait, what? there is a game..?",1
"well, much like previous elder scrolls games (im looking at you, oblivion) the main quest line is very short, and very easy. fortunately, theres plenty of other questing to be done, and the modding community is amazing, as it always has been. so, yeah, great (if a bit easy) content, great modding community, great game. except for the guards bringing up knee arrows, but theres a mod to fix that!",1

"it is quite fun, it takes hours to get bored and accomplish everything in the game. its like a life away from reality. choosing who and how you will become stronger and what you want to be stronger in. i believe this is one of the finest, and realist games ever. i wish they even went futher with the quest though they could of made many more......",1
"it is not the fastest selling title ever on steam for nothing. taking everything that was great about tes iv: oblivion and improving upon that which wasnt , tes v: skyrim truly is an epic epic.",3

"a great rpg so many possible ways to custimize your character",1
"i thoroughly enjoyed this game it is one of my favorite games! get it!",1
"skyrim is a single player game based in medivalish times with a massive map to explore. i think this game is good for anyone wanting to take on dragons, murderers and bandits on by themselvs. i would rate this game 8.5/10",1
"this game is not a causal game. it is a big game. you will be playing it a long time. its has years worth of ish to do. the story line is immersive and there is a lot going on. the game is a relationship if youre not ready for it youre throwing money away. i do not have the words to decribe to you just how huge a universe this is. step lively.",1
"oh yeah! cheack it 266 hours just living in this northern region of tamriel. i loved it. with the effects i put in and all the dlc, it was worth to lose yourself in there.",2

"the elder scrolls v: skyrim is one of my favorite games of all time, and is absolutely amazing. it is my favorite of the elder scrolls franchise, and the gameplay is incredible. the amount of quests is amazing. 10/10 left me begging for an elder scrolls online key.",1
"absolutely ruined my college progress. awesome game, i can only reommend it.",1
"i have been an avid elderscrolls gamers since daggerfall and this game has usurpt my life. i love this game! even though they have in my opinion, over simplified some things in the game and combined a few, its very hard to fault this game. you have so many playing styles and you take the souls of dragons and learn many different ways to use them to shout fire, ice or call down a storm!",3

"the fifth installment of the elder scroll series is honestly one of the best games i played. first off, if you are fan of - rpgs medievel action magic/spells awesome mods/mods of almost anything get this game. if i were to give a brief description of the game itself, i would say this. skyrim was the first elder scrolls game i played, and before then, i had no idea what the elder scrolls was and i didnt care. however, when i saw the gameplay of this game, and trailers of it, i was surprised of why didnt i try oblivion or the older games, as skyrim looked so beautiful and awesome. skyrim is a medievel rpg taken to whole level that makes the game feel alive, colourful and wonderful. its one of those games where you could just get lost within the world of quests and gameplay and scenery. it has a unique touch and flavour that makes this game enjoyable still to this day and will still be for a long time. i would go further into detail of the game, but once i go further into detail, this review will be so long, plus skyrim is a game that cant be described entirley with words of its awesomness, you just need to play it to understand how great of a game it is. 9.5/10",1

"imagine earth with magic and dragons around the 1700s. you are a fighter/mage/trickster/rogue/whathaveyou that runs about joining clubs and killing magical creatures. its all the quests you could ever dream of + more free dlc than you could ever hope for. 10/10.",2
"all of oblivions flaws were perfected in the elder scrolls v: skyrim. the magic system is much more appealing than it was in oblivion and the various approaches to a battle are more balanced than ever. the music is incredible to say the least and the graphics are mind-blowing. bethesda also improved their reputation by removing the technical issues that are normally sprinkled in their games. this is an easy recommendation to any gamer out there looking for an awesome game. gameplay: 19/20 ... awesome (the bugs with the dragons and the quantity over quality concept is annoying) story: 8/10 ... great graphics: 5/5 ... perfect sound/music: 5/5 ... flawless (so epic...) controls 5/5 ... perfect overall: 93% (42/45) ... awesome",2
"this game is amazing! hours of gameplay. i liked it so much on the xbox 360 that i bought on pc! i would recommend buying this game anytime especially now since its on sale for $7.49. best game ive ever had.",1
"i have never managed to get into playing the elder scrolls games, much as ive always wanted to. the ui and controls bugged me, but skyrim finally latched its claws into me. the ui still isnt the greatest but i find it much easier to pick up and play than either morrowind or oblivion. and ive barely scratched the surface! i find myself replaying the intro over and over, just creating characters and wandering around looking at the beauty of the world. stunning. combat feels much more intuitive to me than earlier incarnations and if i could stop playing my other obsessions for even a moment, i fear i could be lost for months, if not years in this beautiful, non-linear, open world.",1

"i have had very memorable memories with this game! 10/10",1
"i broke my game after less then an hour of playing it. ten stars.",2
"how could someone not love this game? i dont play a lot of video games but i have so many hours logged into this one. it has so much to do, you can never get bored. and although you may get to a point with one character that you dont feel that theres much important things to do, then you create another character and make this one completely different. its a beautiful game and has stolen many hours of my life away from me. buy this game. seriously. its worth every penny.",2
"so far im really enjoying it. the story is immersive, and i honestly feel like an adventurer when im slaying enemies in cold blood and stealing their loot. do be careful with the workshop, and dont have too many mods activated at the same time.",1
"where to even begin with this game. if you havent already been convinced to play this game, i will give you my reasons to why this game is a must buy. i have played this game on console and pc, and i would first like to say that you get such an incredible and immersive experience on the pc. the mods in this game enhance the game to a new level. i feel that the most important thing to look at when judging a game is the replay value, and this game will have you playing for hours on end and still have a ton of things to do. you have so many different ways to approach the game aswell, so you can always start the game over and play as a different type of character whether it be an upclose heavy armored warrior, a mage, an assasin, a thief, a combination of these, and many more! there are so many skills to master and such a vast world to discover that you will find yourself playing this game for hours without the game losing any pace. there is also alot of history in the game for you to learn about and it will immerse you into the game even more because you have a better understanding of how verything came to be. absolute must buy for any rpg fan and other gamers looking for hours of gameplay.",1
"probably best rpg game ever, or at least my favorite one. this open and immersive world will take u away with all the side quests it contains.",1
"even more then two years after its release, i still play this title. the active community in the steam workshop makes it possible to tailor the experience and immersion as one can see fit.",3

"fallout new vegas is the greatest game i have ever played. this cheese wheel eating simulator is the most advanced piece of modding software i have ever seen since bettysda graced us with the origina fallout. you can be a cat and punch bandits this game gets my official 16/9 i suggest you go buy some twinkies",1
"this game is spectacular. although some find it numbing after the first playthrough, ive played it over ten different times. each time im met with new game content. i go: have i been here before? the answer would be no! i completely missed it through the last six playthroughs. this is definetly a good buy. if skyrim isnt enough, i suggest you get the dlcs and if thats not possible for you, get some mods. the mods really add depth to the game that the console version cant have.",1

"it is epic and i highly recommend this game it is the best game for any one that is in to adventure games",1
"great game. second most played on steam (right after borderlands 2), and thats quite an accomplishment. exploring is really what makes this game worthwhile, and if you pick up some loot mods (or mods in general), everything is as good as you want it to be. definitely pick it up with the dlc.",1
"oh lordie lord. if there is a perfect game, this is it.",1
"you can pause in the middle of a battle and consume an ungodly amount of cheese wheels, making this game one of the best games ever to exist simply because of how many cheese wheels you can consume in the middle of a battle. can you imagine somebody just carrying all these  cheese wheels into battle? bewilder friends and foe alike with your unholy cheese wheel obsession, you daring thing, you. 10/10, would play again for some more cheese wheels. also there are dragons and swords and magic and stuff whatever no big deal. p.s. can someone make it so that a single cheese wheel only takes up 0.1 carrying capacity? no reason just that it would be super useful im asking for a friend ok thanks mate",1
"steam asked me if i recommend this game, erm yeah sure but only if it is modded",1
"great game. skyrim is beautiful and vast. exploration and dungeon crawling and figthing is very fun. the story is pretty basic, and its a lot better than the doorknob level of complexity of oblivion but it still doesnt live up to the awesome sauce of morrowind. the ui has been gimped to accomodate gamepad console gamers too, so thats very dissapointing. having said all that, its still a blast to play and i sunk about 140 hours into it (without any dlc).",1
"do i really have to explain why i love this game so much?? great graphics, good story, tons of stuff to do, and one of the best modding communities you can find. seriously, if youre an rpg fan, you owe it to yourself to get this game! and the dlcs only make it better. dawnguard introduces a new faction, new abilities, perks that actually make lycanthropy useful, and one of the most likeable, most well written companions in the series (which, admittedly, isnt hard, but still). dragonborn, meanwhile, adds an entire landmass to the game, full of quests, dungeons, loot, and colorful npcs. yeah, it can be buggy, but thats what mods are for. this games modding community is one of the best around, and as such the game is always growing and improving. this is one of the definite open world wrpgs on the pc. 9/10.",1

"i had been hyped for this game, ever since it had been announced. i had enjoyed playing through oblivion on ps3, and morrowind on my old pc, the elder scrolls series had earned itself a special place in my heart, as one of my favourite western rpg series. after picking the game up, shortly after its release, on pc, i eagerly put the game disc in, intent on playing what would inevitably me a masterpiece. it didnt work. but many days later, i input the registry code into steam, to play it. i had waited forever for this game, and when i at first entered the world, one thing would be forever clear. it ing suck",2

"theres a lot of love for the elder scrolls series, and as someone thats played daggerfall, morrowind, and oblivion, i have to reluctantly say this was my least favorite of the series. the story line does not compell me, nothing in the game really gives me any real reason to care about the overall plot. the dialogue is stiff and feels archiac in the modern age of cinematic gaming. and worst of all, the gameplay hasnt evolved, aside from a pretty skill tree id say its regressed in a lot of significant ways. the combat is the worst part of all, i was so excited to kill a dragon for the first time and it was easily one of the most bitter disappointments i experienced. it doesnt react to your attacks, it just sort of unceremoniously coils over and disintigrates into ash. theres no rewarding feeling in any of the combat, and to me the fact that these titles havent evolved since 2001 indicates to me a philosophical issue where the developers feel theyre unable to make a truly great game. i did put about 40 hours into the game which is generally seen as a paltry amount for any game in the elderscrolls series, but it was enough for me to know it wasnt a rewarding experience.",1
"i bought this game for $7.50 and only about 16 hours into the game, i believe it is easily one of the best deals i have made and would have bought it for $60. skyrim has an incredible replay value right behind minecraft and i am amazed how big the world is. there is always something new to be discovered. definitely 10/10.",1

"i had not played pokemon games before--i was under the wrong impression that they were just for children and then there was a lot of media attention on fire red and leaf green--i was going on a long trip so i got fire red. it takes a lot of memorization skills to play pokemon games well so adults can enjoy these games, in my opinion. for those who havent played before, pokemon are actually very intricate and there are different types of pokemon so you have to remember their abilities and what types can easily beat other types and you switch pokemon in battle depending on their strengths and abilities. of course the graphics on this game are very, very good. what i liked best was the ability to get ingame help and for some reason it just really tickles me to see the little hand pick up my pokemon and move them to or from the storage boxes. i also like the fact that when i turn the game on it rehashes the last few things i did before stopping gameplay last time. this is really good for me because i dont get to play everyday and if too much time goes by, i do forget my last moves. i also have pokemon crystal for gbc and, i think it is a little easier...so if youd like to try pokemon, maybe that is a better game to learn first...both have been very fun and entertaining for this adult gamer. gotta catch em all...",1

"long hours of immersive gameplay. real-time combat with fun and interesting quests best played at adept diffifulty and above magic spell scaling and arrow damage sucks some gameplay elements and item values are not realistic enough (the above mentioned can be solved by downloading mods on steam) bad walking speed and somewhat limited combat which is similar to older elder scroll games overall. long hours of gameplay if you enjoy oldern methods of fighting with many interesting quests",1
"one of the only games (if not the only game) i can play forever without ever getting bored of it. -new things about the game im still discovering -good questlines (many different factions to join) -beautiful landscape -farm potatoes and if any of that doesnt catch your attention or sound fun, than you can get one of the great assets that were never available to me back when i only had an x360..... mods.",1
"eh. i know this got amazing reviews. but for me, its not that amazing. its a beauitful game, good graphics, lots of play time, and customization. but i stopped playing it when i got to level 20 or so. once i beat the main story, i kinda got bored of the game.",1
"this game ... well its not all that great , i greatly prefer the fallout series , however its not just that , this game is extremly buggy and is far over rated, but this is coming from someone who greatly enjoys fallout new vegas . just there are common texture issues and such , i do reccomend it because its fun but i think that a title such as fallout 3 or maybe some of the older fallouts would be better , maybe you might like oblivion more , just this game is just overrated and not all that people say it is , however mods can fix some of your problems",1

"very fun adventure/free roam game. i would highly recommend this game, it is so much better on pc than consoles as you can get really nice mods. different mods include nice graphics, new quests, new followers, new weapons etc. i am a big fan of bethesdas games such as fallout and the elder scrolls. 10/10",1
"this game is really epic.. intense battles and awesome weapons. seriously the best elder scrolls game created",1

"i have no idea what i am even playing. is this even a game, or is it random madness? i assume there are multiple levels, but i cant even figure out what to do in the first level, which is a horrible asteroids type game where an anime girl is ranting bible quotes at you. from reading some more the intent was to make a supposed old bad bible game -- well, they succeeded absolutely. 0/10 jesus is a prick",2

"i have played countless hours of this on consoles and i was in love with this game but it got really dry once i beat the game. well with the wonderful mod community on here and nexus this game is like brand new! i suggest the frostfall mod with ineed immersive armors enhanced blood and of course the sxp and the random begining (so you dont have to spend all the time going through the first mission and it also a level of difficulty because it can start you anywhere in skyrim!) mods and this is the perfect setup for endless amounts of skyrim fun!",1
"in a lot of ways, it is a typical open-world game: there are missions you can go on, if you chose to accept them; there are no level restrictions to certain areas; you are free to level up your character as desired with no pre-set formats. in other ways, the game can be a bit tedious: the combat is not that complex; archery is a bit over powered; and the skills system is mundane to level up (you either gain skill points by using the skill or purchase them from trainers). but that said, i love this game, a fact evidenced by the almost 300 hours ive spent playing this game. the level of detail to the environment and atmosphere is tremendous. the ability to mod the game, and the mods that have come out, its what truly give this game its beauty. if you are the kind of person that loves expansive, immersive environments, you must have this game. if you are a game-lore nerd, you must buy this game.",2
"this is a really well made game that will provide hours and hours of entertainment! i have played it quite a bit and i am sure i have not finished half of the game yet. there is always something new and exciting to do. 10/10",1

"to put it short this is my review: this game is amazing and immersive. some people say it is a grind to do all the side quests but i beg to differ. each side quest offers up new opportunities and new experiences. and i mean some quests are really serious and then there are just plain out weird/hilarious ones. but overall this game gets a good 9/10",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. bought it for the computer after i played on the xbox.may not be the best graphics. but this game is great 9/10 rating thumbs up. very good rpg fantasy adventuring game. if you like rpgs dont miss up a pass to get this one.",1

(because of the plate). fought a dragon. stole a crown. got drunk. became a werewolf. killed bees with fire. followed a talking dog. visited the old dwarven cities. killed robots. became an assassin. killed the emperor. got beaten to death by a whole town for stealing a cabbage. became a respected general. fought bandits. poisoned mead. stole cabbage again. 10/10 would skyrim again.",1
"this is probably my favourite game of all in my steam library. i actually preferred skyrim over morrowind and oblivion, maybe because of the setting or the graphics. i cant really explain why, but this game is incredible. the main storyline is somewhat disappointing, but a lot of the side quests are really really great and clearly had a lot of thought and research put into them. as you can see by the hours i have played this for, even when you have done every single quest in the main game and the dlcs, skyrim is till fun to come back to and play around with or try some mods out. definetly would recommend this game above pretty much any other. 10/10",2
"now, at 80 hours in, it still feels like its just the beginning. there is so much to do and explore that a perfectionist like me would feel overwhelmed at first. that is before you realize that this game was meant to be overwhelming, so that no matter how many play throughs you put in, there is always something new to discover. a lot of it is due to the immersive and dynamic world the developers have created. if you somehow manage to get bored or too familiar with vanilla content, the products of the mod community will keep you occupied for a long time. would i recommend this game to others? of course! downsides: you need a few weeks off work and a diaper.",1

"must say this is possibly one of the best games you can get for pc. the workshop creates endless possibilities!",1
"this game is in my top10 of all time. i would completely recommend buying this game...just not at the 59.99 mark this late in its rotation. two and half dlcs and main game is still at new game price point...boggles the mind. wait till a sale or better yet wait for consolidated version at same price point eventually.",2
"a great rpg experience. improves heavily on the mechanics of oblivion. skyrim provides hundreds of hours of gameplay and builds apon its predeceer (tes:oblivion) graphical fidelity is sadly not the greatest in skyrim but mods and enbs are available to add to the experience. but the game makes up for this with lush landscapes and mightly mountians to explore. the environments range from snowy mountians to the sunny town of riverrun to the towering capital solitudes blue palace. outdoors environments help build the epic atmosphere of skyrim with wildlife and bandits. but best of all. dragons. fighting dragons is the pinnacle experience of the game as they approach from the sky you will have to use shouts. as the dragonborn, you can use these shouts to cast a dragon from the sky to the ground, breath fire and even freeze time. as the dragonborn your primary quest will be to save the world from the almighty dragon alduin. but not just that, you can pursuit many more quests, you can just the dark brotherhood, become a mage, join the companions and even become a bard! skyrim is a world so engrossing that its flaws are more than made up for with its impressive open world, immersive character development and amount of incredible content. i recommend this game to everyone, skyrim truly is an epic experience!",1

"you could spend years on this game!! with the dlc too you will be happyly engaged for weeks :)",1
"game is good, user mods are better. since this seems to be hard to understand: bethesda made an absolutely awesome game, with a great storyline, and a wonderfull landscape. but there is something that makes this game one of the best rpgs ever made. the compatibility for user mods. (called workshop in steam). the users make all the mods for this game for things which bethesda coulndt finish because at some point ppl didnt want to wait for it anymore. it takes some time til u can use all the user mods, but they greatly improve this already great game.",1
"this game is amazing and that is coming from someone who isnt that big of a fan of majic and all that stuff. there is infinite possibilities with mods from nexus and steam workshop. highly reccomended",1
"ignore haters. bethesda delivers, once again, one of the greatest epics of videogame history. youre back in tamriel, hundreds of years after the oblivion crysis and right in the continent of skyrim. the empires in shambles, theres a civil war to get rid of them going on, and dragons are back. and as always, its simplier than morrowind. get it. play it. and wait for elder scrools 6 and avoid eso like the rest.",2

"hands down the best rpg ive ever played. its so deep and open ended. there are tons of things to do in this epic single player experience. i cant get enough of it. ive poured plenty more hours than what my playtime says, yet i have not explored all of skyrim. if you love rpgs, then you need to own this game. this is the rpg killer. this is the one that sets the bar and beats them all.",1
"its skyrim 10/10 great mods, and great world. a must buy",1
"great game with a huge world to discover. you can tell that its related to fallout 3 and fallout new vegas, so if you liked those you might like this as well. i prefer the post apocalyptic future fallout universe, but for a fantasy world this game is quite well done. i can tell, because i like it even though i usually dont like fantasy scenarios with dragons etc. at all. it seems to still have some stability problems, though - at least on my windows 8.1 with a radeon graphics card and intel processor. if i put the setting for shadows to ultra, my frame rate is still alright (amds gaming evolved even suggests these settings), but the game crashes to the desktop almost immediately. took me a while to figure out what was causing it, because on the internet people seem to have found some more things that apparently can cause this game to crash to the desktop (without any error message) as well. i already had similar problems with fallout, so i hope bethesda is going to consider stability more in the development of fallout 4. anyways, you might also want to get the official hd texture pack here on steam for free (if not even the countless unofficial graphics mods), because many textures are not very nice to look at.",1
"unfortunately, this is by far the worst game ive ever own on steam (or anywhere else). skyrim is full of bugs and its even not playable. try getting past the intro-scenes in-game and youre a champion. the horses and wagons are all f-cked up.",1
"one of the best games ive ever played. back when i was a mere console pesant i had over a hundred hours clocked into this masterpiece. but now that i see this game on pc im never going back. from the beautiful views of the moon and mountains to the faciel expressions of the people in the cities. smithing and potion making has never been this great in any other game i have played in the past as well as the different perks that come with the races. all in all, i would recoment this game to my friends. stay fabulous people, -wordsmith",1
"amazing game. but if you dont mod it... youre missing the pont. the thing is: if you got if for console when you could get it on a pc that can run it then youre missing out. the ammount of mods is uncountable and is increasing by the second. if you think this game is boring then youre wrong. mods allow for endless playing with constant new stuff and things ;)",1

"this is one of the best video game ive played in my life.it has great gameplay,music,story,graphics.it really catches the nordic viking vibe and put it in a fantastic open world fantasy rpg.once you start playing and get into the story you become hooked to the world of tamriel.if you like fantasy games,dragons or magic you should definitely play this game!.i and probably evry single person who has played this game would say its easily on of the top 10 video games the have played or will ever play.if you should pay any respect to the gameing universe this is the game for you!!!. 10/10 -dittife",1

"i took my pants of and punched a dude in the face. pig/420",1
"i am recently play two bethesda game: fallout new vegas and this one. personally, i like this one better than fallout(someone might disagree with me). this game somehow makes you eager to face dragon, because you can unlock more dragon shouts,and a big world, adoption, building a home, marriage, loot, adventure. all of this can make this game worth of 40 bucks, i am sure of that.",1
"the elder scrolls v - skyrim is with no doubt one of the best games recently released. an open-world rpg with an infinite amount of quests and modding support ? count me in. the replayability is also almost endless, because you can make a totally new character with other skills and so have a new experience. installing mods can also help you fighting the boredom when youve reached 300+ hours ingame.",1
"my review of this game is pointless as there are already hundreds of people extolling its virtues. ill just say that any new players might consider doing an initial playthrough without mods just so they can appreciate how much the mods add to the game.",5
"amazing, mods on the workshop and on the nexus are awsome gameplay 10/10 (interesting combat) quests 9/10 (most are very fun only a couple are boring) mods 10/10 (i suggest immersive armor and weapon) (on nexus only) faction 9/10 (the factions are cool and also u can get more with mods) (without mods ones are imperial,stormclock,dark brotherhood(assassins),theifs guild and more! graphics 10/10 (stunning) overall 9 1/2 /10 btw game is under priced its worth probley around 40 bucks not 30",1
"best gaming experience ever! not as good as the story in morrowind, but still a darn good one. however, the vanilla graphics suck but can be enhanced with mods, created by the massive mod community of skyrim and basically all bethesda games. everything about the lore and immersiveness has driven me to addiction over this game. 10/10",1
"skyrim is an epic rpg adventure, ive been playing it for months now and it never gets old.",4
"this is a brilliant game.... due to the massive open world and a multitude of play styles, you really can play this one over and over again with the freedom to use your own style. there is also a huge amount of modder support, meaning once youve seen all there is to see from the vanilla game, you can add and tweak to your hearts content. at the time of writing i have 154 hours of game time. its one of those games i just keep coming back to.",1

"huge, in depth and custimisable..... the elder scrolls skyrim is one of the best rpgs in history with and in depth skill tree, lots of races to choose from and over 150+ hours of content. note:the reason i dont have many hours on skyrim is because i used to play it on console but now i play skyrim on pc the way it should be played with loads and loads of mods",1
"this game is in depth and has so much lore and hidden details going into it.... other than the lore and the in depthness it also has brilliant gameplay and role playing elements to it e.g if you dont want to fight dragons in brilliant battles to the depth you can get level 100 blacksmithing without entering whiterun (i dont suggest that)... im mainly doing this for a badge so bye",1

"first of all, if you havent heard of this game by now, you should check it out right away. it was probably the best 40 i invested in my gaming career and it still after 200 hours offers an insane amount of fun. there is simply so much to do and so many things to discover. with all the skills and the rich backstory, this is just the pinnacle of any rpg. the graphics are beautiful even without any mods, and you can actually empathize with some of the characters. of course, you can become a rampant mage-warrior-orc, but the holds are so beautiful and on higher difficulties any enemy becomes dangerous. i recommend playing on a higher difficulty, because then it feels like you are really on a quest. tons and tons of fun to be had with this game!",1

"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4

"shouted a bandit off a tower to watch him ragdoll through the air only to smash into the ground and practically swim away. 10/10. skyrim is one of the best games i have ever played, being allowed to use different types of weapons, magic, and shouts gives a feeling of diversity and vastness to the game. being allowed to shout someone off a tall tower, well, you can tell how awesome this game is just because of that. having hundreds of hours of gameplay and dlc allows the player to engage in fun combat without becoming bored quickly. having a large amount of customization also gives the player a bit of a creative and inviting feeling. i would recommend this game to anyone (apart from the occasional young child that thinks its fun to play only violent games, that is.) who enjoys a long, action filled adventure through a countryside to only then be attacked by giants and mammoths and the occasional dragon or... well... who am i kidding, being attacked by all of dragonkind.",1

"beautiful, expansive, epic, and addictive. i litterally sat down for a summer and racked up over 400 hours and still had so much left that could be accomplished on a single character. and i played this unmodded. with the rediculous amount of mods out there, you could continue to play this game until half-life 3 finally comes out. skyrim offers everything i would ever need in a game: exploration, adventure, customization, excessive item hoarding (optional), entire weeks disappearing, replayability, and so much more. ive sunk so many hours into this game and ive enjoyed every second of it.",3

"note: i did not put over 200 hours into this game, i let my freind use my acount and him and his dad racked up these hours. quick thoughts: -it seems like the only people who like this game is people that either dont like rpgs or have never played a tes game. -this is not a rpg, its a action hack and slash game with rpg elements. -this game is like jumping into a ocean and finding out its a just a pool. -its riddled with things that make no sense and every quest is generic and boring. negitive: -its riddled with things that make no sense and every quest is generic and boring. -the leveling system is just and bad as oblivion. -dragons are way to easy to kill. -you need mods for it to be playable. -horrific ui -boring combat - arrow to the knee - companions - boring world - ruined magic - boring caves positves: - dual weapons is awsome! - music - dlc overall: 2/5",1
"tons of fun, i love the elder scrolls series, and its a good addition to it",1
"its skyrim. another game in the elder scrolls series with the previous title being oblivion, lets just say ive played this game over 3 times and still enjoy it. in fact its my favorite rpg series with fallout being close behind. so i definitely recommend skyrim to any rpg fan.",1
"with skyrim, bethesda manages to include nearly every favorite feature from previous games in the series while adding a mind numbing amount of new content. i hit level 81 at 100 hours and im still excited to explore the rest of the 200 hours worth.",1
"it was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"very nice game, lots of shinny things too touch 10/10",1
"i fus ro downloaded this awesome game. adding some fun mods so i am hunting evil wicked my little ponies!",1
"i wish the skill system was more like oblivion, but. whatever. i became bored of this game very quickly on console. however im still having fun with it on pc do to modability, which made it so i can have the oblivion/morrowind system through mods. if you can, get this on pc, not console.",1
"its an amazing $60 terrain exploration simulator, and maybe thats not a bad thing after all. you can lose hundreds of hours in the beauty of this world, if not the characters. bethesda produces immensly solid titles that perhaps target the median a little too much, but they do it with a sincerety and devotion that is impossible to ignore. i strongly endorse this game.",1
"pretty good game so far. the graphics are beautiful.",1
"i highly recommend this game for all rpg enthusaists and gamers wanting a noob-friendly game. :)",1
"gay... for 13 euro you have the legendary edition wich includes all dlc`s.. diden`t see that.. ><",1
"this game is fun! so much replay ablity! never gets old!",1
"this game is way too addicting, but that is mainly because it is just so amazing with the way that it allows for fantasy style gameplay integrated with thousands of mods. if youre a fan of immersive rpgs, modable first-person environments, and/or amazing scenery (especially with texture mods), this is the game for you. gameplay can be adapted for people who like anything from simple slash-and-bash games to more elaborate role playing, and therefore, as long as you dont have some unexplainable need for guns, this game can bend to your every whim. it does take time to get used to though, as this is nothing like tetris.",1
"the game is really great and the mods make them even better",1
"a masterpiece of the open world rpg genre. the base game alone has mountains of content. but when you add on the offical dlc and the many mods that can be found on steam workshop as well as the nexus, its a game that really has no end.",1

"great game, good value for the money if you can pick it up on sale. im over 80 hours in and still have tons to do if i want to.",1
"im not going to write a big review for this game, because its been talked about so much by pretty much everyone already. the amount of playtime you can get from this game is staggering. the atmosphere and immersion is also awesome. based on that alone, the game is worth it any way you put it. that said, the game has a lot of problems. combat becomes boring real fast. most places you visit looks just like everything youve already seen. the amount quests is just insane, and youre going to be really dissapointed eventually as you discover youre never going to finish them all, without ruining the experience along the way. and the road is long. incredibly long. i dont think im even close to finishing this game. the problem is that i dont think i can find the motivation to go on. there are a lot of mods available to offer tweaks and different experiences alltogether, but the base game is what it is. i prefer the newer fallout games over this one, but even though there are lots of stuff that annoy me about skyrim, its an undeniably successful game that deserves being played. its worth it. im really looking forward to the next game from bethesda.",1
"almost jumped off a cliff because i thought i pressed f5. 10/10 would",1
"an awesome game overall! a lot of depth into the story and multiple quests that will keep you on your screen for a long time. the only minor drawback is the multiple bugs and glitches which may hinder your progression into the storyline.",2
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"skyrim is one of the best rpg games to be on steam. it has a sort of replay-ability because there is so much you can do. if you want to be a sneak thief, as the guards would call you, do it. if you then decide to be a mage, you can either switch in the same game, or just start over and take a new path. 10/10 all in all a great game.",1
"an epic game made all the more epic by the fact that it is so easy to mod and so well supported by the modding community. the elder scrolls series has a large following and often you will hear people argue over each new tes game comparing it to the last, but for me each tes game stands on its own merits, and skyrim is no exception. the story is pretty good and there are plenty of side quests, but what makes skyrim so great even when not modded is its large and open nature. this is a land you can just pick a direction and with no quest in mind and just explore. you will find danger and excitement on your journey ... and loot. lots and lots of loot. but once you start modding this game, that is when you unlock the true value that is skyrim. potentially thousands more hours content (for free) in a game that can be improved ten thousand different ways from graphics, textures and sounds all the way to game mechanics and user interface changes. you can make the game exactly what you need it to be, and play it for so long you may still be playing when the next game in this series comes out.... and sometimes longer than even that. if you are interested in modding the pc version of the game, be sure to check out my guide for beginners:",1
"this game is amazing! its a great rpg with amazing graphics (even better with mods), great combat, fun gameplay and a huge world to enjoy. you need to own this game i mean need to! for me its a 9.5 out of 10. buy this game.",1
"very nice game - can stand next to the classics like morrowind and oblivion - cant wait to see eso released.",1
"there was assuredly a lot of things to fix with oblivion and bethesda managed to fix it all and make it better, not that it was hard to do better than oblivion. the thing is, that game is really gigantic, very impressive and i honestly think its the best game bethesda did since morrowind, both gameplay-wise and graphically.",2
"one of the greatest games ive ever played. seriously. and ive played just about everything.",1
"i walked from helgen to solitude and stopped in every dungeon. i dont know how.",1
"i find this game repetitive and dull, there are fun aspects in it but i feel that when you have gone into one cave filled with either zombies or bandits, youve been to then all, they are always laid out differently but they all look the same and they all have the same enemies in them so it becomes repetitive. ps: pro tip for fighting a dragon, it doesnt matter how strong you or the dragon is, just stand behind a rock and shoot it and it cant hit you.",1
"it took me way too long to start playing this game, and now its so fun i cant stop",1
"a game that is definitely worth the buy, it will take you more than hours to finish the game completely while not even including the expansions packs. so much quests to do and several ways to play the game with different styles.",1
"flawless. everything about this game is amazing. it manages to hold its own against more recent rpgs despite being older. this game will always be a classic.",1
"i highly recommend this game to anyone who has still yet to play. by itself its already a great game, but when you add on top all the mods you are able to use, it essentially makes this game one of the best in the rpg genre. its a must buy!",1
"very great game, it is one that is hard to put down .",1
"love this game! however, just make sure your computer can handle it.",1
"i highly reccomend this game, i may be really pissed about this one mission and spiders scare the living piss out of me, i still really like this game. once you start playing the game you cant stop. the quests are challenging, enjoyable, and may i say awesome. so yeah if you get this game i highly suggest you get a man servant because you wont leave your computer. this game also is pretty bloody so if your under 13 i wouldnt suggest this game to any parents. thats all for today kings and queens, bye!",1
"great game, great content, amazing inmerive story over all an awesome game. when you beat the story i recomened getting mods it makes the game much better",1
"the elder scrolls series has a come a long way since its origins in the old days of msdos, and skyrim is at the pinnacle of modern graphics and story immersion. if you enjoy the thought of losing yourself in a world for hundreds of hours while exploring, questing, and customizing your character to levels only the elder scrolls has truly offered, than skyrim is for you. all youu have to do is look at my played time and i think youll understand what i mean :op be prepared - this game requires a lot of time and attention, but the controls are simple, the world vast and forgiving, and the opportunities to level and advance your character with or without the need for combat are literally everywhere. the dlcs are extensive and enjoyable, and with the newly released legendary edition of the game, you can get the entire experience bundled together for the current price of $60.00 have fun!",2
"i honestly do not understand why people like this game so much. the only reason i can think of is that is it a great time killer. you can walk around for hours, days, weeks even in this game and still you will have a quest log that is literally overflowing with things to do. now the problem for me, however, is that even after the 100+ hours i put into it, i still have not had any fun with any of these quests. they are almost all fetch quest for which you have to enter a dungeon, kill stuff, and go back to collect you reward. now this would be fine if the rewards are actually valuable and if the world and dungeons were interesting to explore. but they are not. the world, while big, is extremely repetitive. everything more or less looks the same. snowy mountains, plains and a few forrests. all dungeons look the same and there is very little enemy variety. and i found the graphics to be very bland and outdated. there are older games then this that look much, much better. the combat in this game is very clunky and lackluster. there is no challenge whatsoever, even if you crank up the difficulty. the story is boring, the characters are boring, and they stripped away almost everything rpg to make it more casual and accessible to the masses. in short: this is a bland, repetitive, unexciting hiking simulator in which you can kill some stuff every once in a while.",1
"great stuff! you dont need to choose a class, because each character can use magic, swords, bows, etc. lots of loot, quests, and... dragons! love this game!",1
"if i had to choose between this game, and my girlfriend. id pick this game. edit: im single now on a more serious note: this game is the best in its genre. in previous bethesda games they made a sad balance in between questing, and exploration. some having more quests and less places to go, and others having very few quests and more places to explore. but in skyrim, there is no shortage of quests, and if you are like myself and just wander around aimlessly, you will stumble into places that just blow your mind. every time i have replayed this game, i stumbled into something new. for more info id very much recommend mods, with mods such as texture packs, difficulty, quests, armor, and weapons, this games replay value is endless. go through the game once with plain skyrim, then mod the hell out of it. overall id rate this game an easy 10/10. if you havent already. please buy it, give it a little, and i swear you will be hooked.",4
"10/10 - would kill a dragon and make armor out of its skin again.",2
"this is a pretty good, obscure game. i wonder why its not getting any press.",1
"while i normally play on a console, skyrim on any console is one of the greatest rpg/single player games, in my opinion.",1
"great games. great mods with hdr effects. good lore in skyrim.",1
"one of the best games that i have ever played! however, everyone should make use of the great mods available, they make the playing experience even better!",1
"this is a very satisfying game to play. mod heaven",1
"epicness ing fun you have pc so mod the  out of it and its really awesome",1
"awesome graphics and brilliant gameplay and fairly good combat. could do with a better storyline and diolouge system though",1
"all you need with this game is the zelda audio converter. buy it when it goes on sale if you like sp rpgs.",1
"this is the best game i have ever played. it is very epic and totally open world. if you want to get a good game heres your soulution.",1
"one of the best rpgs in recent time. there is so much you can do that i dont even know where to start. if you like warriors/mages and dragons, then you will love this game. there is so much to explore that you will get lost after a while. you can follow the main quest line or you can wander off and do your own thing and come back to the main quest anytime. there are tons of sides quests, so you will never be bored.",2
"i was half way through main quests... my ocd wanted to remove the 2 infamous side quests... 50 hours later im still trying to finish them and theres 7 side quests now... 10/10 would play all day again",1
"huge game with lots to do. however the story and quest lines are weak. played around 120 hours of it never bothered with finishing the main questline or even most of the guilds questlines. new fun mechanics were added in this game ,but also sadly alot of great mechanics from previous installements arent in here which was a bit of a disapointement (like making your own spells). but overall if you can have 100+ hours of fun in a game without even doing most of the main questlines, then you know you have a really good game. so stop reading this and go play the game already.",1
"400 some hours put into it. yeah its is a good game",2
"if youre going to buy one game on steam. this is it. get mods, and you get an infinite game.",1
"its the elder scrolls. it is skyrim. nuff said...",1
"amazing game. so much fun to play and a lot to do.",1
"possibly one of the best rpgs ever with a thriving modding community to keep the game fresh.",5
"im pretty new to the gamer world so you can take my opinion pretty lightly, but i really love this game! it was the first real rpg i ever played and now i am hooked! i love the open world feel and the graphics are great. i really feel sucked into my character and into skyrim.",1
"if your ok with a dull grey white black world with ugly tunnels only good if you like oblivion and can deal with all those things or if you want to kill ai scum",1
"bethesda knocked it out the park with this one. very immersive medieval type gameplay set in the elder scrolls lore. get nexus mod installer as always with bethesda games they need a little bit of tweaking, probably due to the console porting, but its very minor. the mod database is strong with this one, and some of the mods extend the game beyond even the dlc. go get it when you can, put some headphones on, and prepare to immerse yourself.",1
"i first purchased this game on ps3 when it first came out, but after i got an alienware i decided to take the plunge and get it for pc. boy was that the best decision ever. this game is beautiful. the graphics absolutely blow me away with the detail, and the ability to make me feel like i am walking in the world of skyrim. the gameplay is great too. i prefer to play with a controller, and it is extremely easy and inuitive to get that set up and working. all controls are easy to use. as for the gameplay itself, i could play this game endlessly and always find somethign new. i have started over i think a total of 10 times and havent gotten bored yet. (i just like to try different characters out) wonderful wonderful game and i can safely say one of the best i have ever played.",1
"do i recommend this game? is this even a question? **** ya i do!",1
"best open-world rpg currently in existence. if you want to have a living breathing open-world experience this is the place to be.",3
"summery in a few words - the best elder scrolls to date. even those who loved morrowind and liked oblivion will love this one. though some pc specific ui would have been nice. like implementation of hotkeys. still the sheer number of content will surprise you....... guarantee",1
"this game owns!!! buy it! no internet? no friends? tired of fapping? no problem!",1
"a wonderful game by itself, the modding community only helps this along to its true potential as a great free-roaming rpg.",2
"i love this game. way too addicting but that shows how great it is. a huge map with stuff to see, and also dont forget the mods!",2
"if you were a fan of tesiii: morrowind or tesiv: oblivion, skyrim is a must. it is a great open world rpg waiting for you to jump in and explore. from cities to caves, mages to thieves, and everything in between, skyrim will draw you in no matter what type of player you are. the scenery is amazing, especially if your computer can handle high quality. there are occasional glitches, but hopefully they will be sorted out in time. overall, skyrim will send you on an intense journey across a warring land, shaping your game play as you go. i would give it a 10/10, mainly because the arnold schwarzenegger voiced guards make up for any of the rare glitches. good job bethesda.",1
"with the right erotic mods from the nexus and lovers lab this game becomes the ultimate fapping simulator of 2014! 10/10 would bang",1
"skyrim is the type of game where you spend 30 mins+ in a dungeon then spend another 30 mins+ selling and stashing your loot and buying new armor and weapons and then you find a new quest or dungeon to do then repeat the process. how i say it makes it sound boring but you are engaged every single second.",1
"i think we all know why i recomended this but if you dont know why, i will tell you. hours and hours of gameplay, open world, you are the all legendary dragon born, you can choose how your player acts (good, evil), hundreds of different quest lines, many different armors and weapons, kill dragons, buy, build your own house. i could go on for hours.....buy this game (and the dlc)",1
"the epic rpg game, the elder scroll! skyrim continues the story in the elder scroll. highly free style rpg let you adventure in the massive world. fantastic visual effect and extraordinary stories make skyrim the best rpg game ever! rpgskyrimrpgskyrimrpg",1
"i absolutely loved this game. i created a multitude of different characters and exploration never got old for me and after 700+ hours of gameplay thats saying something.",3
"a very fun game that fully immerses you into a prodigious world i have yet to find the end of. there are so many places to explore and complete. i havent progressed much in the main storyline due to an extreme interest in the plethora of sidequests that better explain the world, bring to life the characters, and strengthen my own i would highly recommend to those who like adventure, fights, role playing, and long, immersive hours of gameplay",1
"you skyrim for updating to the point where my computer cant run it... thank you whoever updated it for being a ing ...",1
"pretty cool. ah what the hell its awesome. especially with mods.",1
"its honestly the best thing that has happen to my life.",1
"definitely recommend, but also get a feel for the mods as bethesda always seems to need a little boost from the community.",1
"one of the best games out there, well worth the price. 10/10",1
"has it already been two years?? damn that went fast. you can easily put 100+ hours into this thing. cant wait until the next one.",1
"one of the most boring games i have ever experienced. even more boring than oblivion. will be the last elder scroll game for me. just not my thing, i suppose.",1
"the best game of 2011. story and the characters are a bit weak, but the sheer amount of things to do and places to see cannot be matched. this time its not just endless cut & paste dungeons either - it feels like for the first time in the elder scrolls series the technology, gameplay and general scope merge together to form a really satisfying game.",1
"best sandbox game ive played since fallout 3. pros: got me through multiple  new england winters without gaining 25 pounds in delivery calzone weight. cons: i used to have a life until i took an arrow in the knee.",2
"you can take this game to whole new levels on pc. its a must-have.",1
"nothing like some good old generic skyrim, eh? while there are glitches in this game, it holds a special place in my heart. if you enjoy adventure, or just cliches, pick this game up when it is on sale. mods make it enlessly replayable as well. 11/10",1
"so this year on the steam summer sale i spent over $100 in games, and i can honestly say that out of all these games, this is the best one. i never liked this on console and never got into it but i love it hear. so many mods to make it realistic and beautiful. i highly reccoemend. plus there is a free hd content dlc, just click the down arrow for the dlc packs. if you ever need help in this game contact me",1
"picture a sandbox with a sword sticking up in the middle. 10/10",1
"this game is awsome and a must play when you buy the game your going to have a awsome time playing and if you get bored then get mods on the steam workshop thay will inprove your gameplay :) so good job steam ten outa ten beat buy evar waring:game will cause lost of social live and events.",1
"it is a perfect mixture of tes iii: morrowind, fallout 3 and tes iv: oblivion in all aspects(probably earlier tes games, but i havent tried those). its like you think youve ordered a pizza; but get a whole buffet of all your favourite foods and a symphonic orcestra playing that epic tes music you remember. this game is epic from the moment you receive the dvd/download, and just never ends beeing it. 10/10, 100/100 6/6, yeah and all the other top scores possible! buy it, be dorahkiin!",1
"of all the games i own; skyrim remains the crown juvel of my collection, and it is to this day still one of the only games that i would recommend to everyone regardless of their gaming experience.",2
"this is one of the best rpg games ive ever played. 9/10",1
"i was married when i got this game. 10/10 would lose everything again",1
"i loved this game on xbox 360 but the pc version is much better especially with the plethora of great mods.",1
"i had a lot of fun with this version of skyrim i think it is loads better than the consle versions pros you have mods now. to me that makes it so much more fun. cons it is confusing how the controls work at first. some mods dont work for the game",1
"are you looking for a game that can pass time like never before? then this is your game! 10/10",3
"open world & fantasy. filled with dragons, cool magics, badass weaponry & armour. i personally enjoyed it.",1
"you can play this game over and over again trying different builds (though i mostly end up being a sneaky archer and swords man). this game never gets boring, and if it does somehow, theres a ton of addons and mods you can choose from (my personal favourite in terms of user mods: helgen reborn). over all this game will fill many hours, as long as you fully play it (meaning not just rushing the main quest). there are many nice side quests that are often better then the main quest (the thives guild quest imo for example). the dlcs dragonborn (having started the elder scrolls with morrowind, i especially enjoyed dragonborn) and dawnguard add to the many quests and play time. a great game!",1
"i personally have played this game for such a long time. i love open worlds and i still come back to this game every now and then to play it.",2
"one of the best games ive ever played. great enviorment and combat engaging gameplay. also the game is very moddable. anyone who hasnt played needs to.",3
"one of the best games on my steam. 10/10 would rullsko again!",1
"you can have a dog as a follower and get a 1000 gold bounty from killing a chicken 11/10",1
"i found this to be a dissapointing fps as the gunplay was awefull i realy think that bethesda should work harder as an rts like this should deserve better, that being said it did not have a supporting franchise/ previous games to assist its release in all i would give it a /1000. would recomend it to that guy that works in the supermarket!",1
"skyrim will give you hours, upon hours of gameplay. with the workshop community constantly making new content, it is like getting free dlc. it almost feels like a self-sustaining world, growing by itself. awesome game.",1
"last update received today will not allow me to play skyrim. steam is terrible. i dont recommend it.",3
"this is a good game but you will soon relise it is worth getting something like arma2 with the dayz mod i do not regret buying this game as you can walk around and fourm groups but it all depends on the type of pc you have bad pc = lots of lag. good pc = not anylag at all",1
"i recommend to play skyrim. this is the first game in years, which i would say is worth its money. a lot of content, 5 major quest lines, and uncountable side quests and missions. the world is huge, and nice in various ways. each dungeon is well planned and makes a lot of fun to adventure them. if you rush, you can play through a dungeon in 6-7 minutes, but normally, you will end up in discovering each and every corner of each and every room, and in the end, you needed more than 1 hour for the cave. if you like rpg-games, you have to play this game. its a must. i hope that a lot of other games will follow the quality of this game. 10/10 points for skyrim",2
"the elder scrolls: skyrim is a huge and immersive rpg one of the best one i have ever play 10/10",1
"a great game, but you dont need vino to tell you that. come on, dude. what are you doing reading my review of skyrim? go out and do something with your life. or play skyrim. thats what im doing.",1
"a superb title, in spite of the sometimes moronic ai (its easy to overcome). massive world to explore, beasts to slay, and bodies to loot! truly, a must-have for every fan and newcomer. oh, and theres a plethora of astounding mods for better graphical fidelity, quests, and items. even just the vanilla version is worth the purchase!",2
"my mom says that this game turned me mad. my friends say you are killing your own social life 10/10 one of the best games ever",1
"if you havent at least tried skyrim yet, do it. with the modding community still thriving and the price continuing to get lower, its a great investment.",1
"its an amazing game. if youre contemplating buying it buy it. its sooooooooooooooo worth it. buy it buy it",1
"this game is awesome i would recomend it to anyone and everyone!",2
"give this game your money, it will take away most of your free time. too good for words 10/10",1
"used to visit real life, then i took an arrow in the knee. 11/10",1
"i have always loved bethesda studios games and this one was no exception i have spent countless hours playing this game i never seem to get bored of it. and then if you want more fun you can always go though the mods",2
"this game is well good. you can get drunk and punch bears. 10/10",1
"i love this game. mainly because i enjoy he graphics. there so many places to go and things you can do. its an entire world of its own.",1
"not nearly as good as people make it out to be in my opinion, but now that its $30 id say its worth playing.",2
"game of the year, highly modifiable! i enjoyed this game, but it does get old once you beat it",2
"please dont make me right a review for this game. just buy and then tell me how much sex you had with lydia of whiterun",1
"oh, beautiful skyrim! prettier than most women, more fascinating than any other game. the hours we spent together were absolutely beautiful. if youre and rpg fan and dont own skyrim - well, dont call yourself and rpg fan.",2
"such an amazing game, despite its many bugs the shear size and length of the game make it worth it, and mods add even more playtime to it",2
"yeah this is rpg crack. get me an iv drip, im not leaving my pc.",1
"good rpg, was addicted to it on xbox for awhile. only downside is that there are alot of perverted mods (not like its a huge deal though). damn people are perverts",2
"skyrim has one of the best rpg atmospheres and stories ive ever seen in a game but its a bit unbalenced and clunky. i wish bethesda would put more programming and testing love into the game and fix up these problems.",1
"if youre into open world rpgs then this is your type of game",1
"this game will never get old. always new mods being made for the game and endless hours of exploration added. 10/10 would play till im old.",1
"this game is so good that i forgot it didnt have multiplayer the game is so immersive!",2
"very immersing feeling on this game. so much quests to do. and extra nice makes all the mods created for this game.",3
"the elder scrolls v: skyrim buy. this. game. the newest installment in the elder scrolls franchise does not disappoint. the multitude of quests, side quests, and scenery will have you coming back again and again. even if youve not played an elder scrolls game before and are unawre of the lore involved, skyrim will get you well aquainted with tamriels history, and provide many hours of entertainment. pros: -quests. many, many quests. -charactor development -charactor customization -multitudes of spells, enchants, weapons, and armor -dlc is worth it -steam workshop gives hours and hours of replayability and enhancements cons: -repeated objectives (go here and retrieve x item) -charactor models a bit lack luster (fixed with mods) if youre looking for a game that has just about everthing in a pseudo medieval setting, then skyrim is for you. if youre not, i still recommend this game",1
"does this game really need a recommendation? you must play it.",3
"excelent game! the game world has tons of places to visit and things to do even if you want to ignore the main questlines, but you will want to do them too since they are well crafted. the mod community on this one is huge and well worth looking into. there are so many mods ranging from aesthetic to animations, content, convenience, audio, etc. that you can make the game into whatever you prefer. often times the mods are made so as to not destroy the intended content of the game, they just make it more to your liking. i personally like it more than morrowind and oblivion (especially since leveling is no longer like the atrocity it was in oblivion). you can make your character whatever you like; wether that be tanky, sneaky, mage-y, a mix of the above, or anything you want. you could even max all skills if you really wanted to then just swap out gear i suppose. highly recommended if you are a fan of rpgs.",1
"one of the few games you spend 200 hours on to complete only then to decide to start again whilst looking forward to it. ive now completed (and brought it with all the dlc) on ps3 (twice), xbox360 and most recently pc (total usage on all platforms over 1000 hours) and still believe its money well spent. cant wait for the next installment",1
"brilliant game, fun, challenging and has lots of hours of gameplay to keep you entertained. i definitely suggest you pick up this game.",1
"this may be the greatest rpg of all time. its simply amazing. this is one game you must experience.",1
"i have played over 100 houes and i am always finding some thing new i will say the story is not as good as oblivion but has a good story and good dlc go for legendary edition",1
"i wish you could kill the kids. otherwise a great game. on a scale of 1 to 10. 1 being bad. 3 being awesome. 8 being jurassic park 2. 9 being the hangover 3 and 10 being ghandi. i would give this game a 11.",1
"one of the best rpg i ever played. 10/10 must play with mods.",1
"bought this thinking oh, it cant possibly be as addicting as everyone says. i was wrong. very wrong.",2
"this game is worth the money spent on it...me and mate are always playing it now...the mate txts me if he can come down just to play skyrim hehe. weve noticed one or two bugs in the game.... im loving it",1
"okay first of all, this game looks amazing! and for twenty dollars its a giant game! this game has so much stuff that you can do, like explore caves, talk to people, do sidequests, or do the story, if you dont feel like playing a game that forces you to keep moving foward like the portal games (which are amazing btw) play this game! you can find so many secret things refrencing minecraft, portal, and other games. the coolest one has to be the headless horseman, so idk why you need me to tell you all these things about a four year old game, but oh well :) very much recommended",1
"i loved this game when i had it for xbox 360, now i love it even more on pc!!!!",1
"this game is awesome.variational{my new word hehe}",1
"a gaming experience that offers a variety of enjoyable playthroughs and a character development system (perks, guardian stones, etc.) that lets you play without as much of a hinderance on playstyle as many other games would seem to enforce, while keeping the door cracked open for interchangeable playstyles without being overly forced to make a new character to play as you want.",4
"fus doh rah!!!!!!! one of the best rpg games there is. fullstop",2
"great game! played it first on the xbox. i played as a meathead mauler, then a battlemage. now that i have it on steam im playing as a pure mage, and am really looking forward to checking out the workshop. skyrim still looks good, and is really fun. however it is a time consuming game. spam save!!!! i cant tell you how many times ive been sucked into the gameplay forget to save, only to be killed by a spider or a mammoth. which i hilariously fun but instantly frustrating when you lose several minutes of gameplay",1
"amazing graphics and endless fun with steam workshop. from making a mountain of cheese wheels to killing as many dragons as you can, you are not limited by imagination. test and see if you breath is as bad as a dragons.",1
"understandably its not as *good* as oblivion but skyrim itself is an artistic/gameplay masterpiece. if you ever want to sink into a game for hours on end skyrims your game. i highly advise buying it if you havnt already. ~ 2k + hours on console",1
"alright 350 hours later, ill finally write a real recommendation. its the buggiest game ive ever played, npc dialogue is recycled and annoying when walking by them, the textures look awful up close, ai is hilariously bad, melee combat is unvaried, etc. and yet despite all the flaws i cant get enough of this game, exploration is just so much fun and the world is fantastic. when you have mods it gets even better because theres thousands of them. the lore is rich and theres hundreds of books and notes to read. theres not as many spells as previous tes games but the spells look great and feel great provided you have a mod to make them scale to your level. the score is amazing despite some repetitive combat music. models for items and creatures look great, blah blah blah. technically the game is pretty bad but if youre able to get past that stuff, its arguably the best open world game ever made. 10/10, game of the decade, would recommend to my cat, thumbs up, best game since duke nukem forever, etc.",3
"brilliant game. bough it as soon as it came out and it did not disappoint. i wont spoil anything, but just buy the game. if not, youve made a life mistake",1
"not only is this game flippin gorgeous, theres nothing more satisfying that shooting people in the face and them go about their daily lives with an arrow in their face.",1
"excellent replayability, as well as a long life (as you can see with over 90 hours on a single save, and thats without any big mods).",1
"this is the game i built a pc for allowing me to become a part of the pc gaming master race, but unfortunately turning away from my former misguided peasant console gamers. friendships have faded, my own brother has spat in my face, and i lost the love of my lfie. 11/10 would break all social and family ties to fight thomas the tank engine dragons",1
"if you like previous elder scrolls games you will like skyrim. there are lots of mods so you can customise the game to your hearts content.",1
"its an elder scroll game... what else to say? like most game... it does have its small quirks and bugs but overall... one hell of a game",1
"probably the only game i have seen to excede its expectations",1
"an awesome rpg with an epic world and decent combat.",1
"this game is the best rpg open world game i ever played",1
"one of the best games out there. couldve had better fighting physics, instead of swords just slicing through people. 5/5",2
"i love this game i played it on the xbox then i got it on my pc :)",1
"i have to say i liked some things about oblivion more, it just had something that skyrim lacks. not really something you can discribe to someone, however this is still a great game and more then worthy of the elder scrolls name (looks at redguard adventure). you start out as a prisoner in true es fashion, right before you are killed by an axe a dragon destroys the town and you are able to make your escape. from there you learn that you are dragonborn a rare skin disease where you whole body grow scales and horns, making you the only one who can sneek up on a dragon and kill it while it is confused about what you are. all in all a great game :>",1
"skyrim is one of my favourite games ever! its a fantasy,rpg were your choices make your own story. if you get it one steam you can get mods and make the game even more fun :d. i would rate this game 10 out of 10 for the pc!",1
"this is a wonderful world to get lost in. it is very much a story driven narrative, and you arent required to play oblivion to understand what is going on, though it will help. great music by jeremy soule adds to a wonderful atmosphere. wandering around and finding dungeons and camps and cities makes for an in-depth experience... for the first 2 or 3 times. there comes a point where you start running around naked punching mudcrabs because you can, because the dragons really dont matter eventually. the dlc is fantatsic, though the boss fights for dlc and main game are lackluster. it feels like you are helped along too much, or that you are too limited in the world. the side quests are the biggest portion of the game, and some of them are fantastic, others just seem strung along for no purpose other than to add time. i would buy this game again, in fact i did on 360 and now on pc. after the first few playthroughs, go to the mod section and go wild, because that will keep you entertaiend for ages. praise to be the dovahkiin!",1
"one of the best games your pc can ever run. this is a must have!",1
"excellent game!!!! this game is one of the best out there. is there an end to the game? only you can find out. the graphics are amazing. the amount of detail placed in the game is awesome. you will spend lots of time this game and with all of the mods out there you will enjoy it even more.",5
"skyrim is one of the best free exploration games i have ever known. it is based off of the elder scrolls series (hence elder scrolls v) and is a medival type of game. you can steal, pickpocket, and the graphics are great. the 30 dollars it takes to buy this game is definatly worth it.",1
"ruined my life more than once, both here and on xbox. 10/10",1
"one of the best games ever created. seriously, buy the game.",1
"this game, just wow! i never thought of it as a wonderful rpg single player game, but it is an amazing, beautiful, adventurous, great story game, ever. i would defiantly recommend this game, because i cant stop playing. especially once you beat the game, use steam workshop and gets weapon, armor, quest, and all the add ons that help with graphics, foilage, just the smallest details. i have 230 add-ons and the game looks beautiful. though even with the add-ons it still is the amazing story line, great engine and funcionality that it is.",1
"skyrim is probably one of my favorite games. i have played it on the xbox, ps3, and pc, and all i can say is... wow. the game is great ; it has an awesome plot, graphics, and interesting mods. because however, i have played it on different consoles, it is annoying to have to restart, and then proceed to get through all the cutscenes and quests i have completed so many times before. but time and time again, i find myself dealing with the struggle and continuing where i left off previously, and strangely enjoying every minute of it. this game has a few flaws, but if you like rpgs, get this game now! 9.5/10",1
"amazing game, very buggy, but what matters and fun and he has a lot",1
"i put a bucket over a guard to sneak past him. 10/10",2
"this is one of those games that has so much replay value. with the help of steam workshop this is almost a new game everytime its played through.",1
"you wouldnt really spend 500+ hrs on a crap game.",2
"i tried going back to console after playing this heavily modded version. 5 minutes in, i missed my call of madness, and came back. 42/10 did rain cheese again.",1
"buy this game, say goodbuy to any other facet of your life, and you wont miss them, trust.",1
"excelllent. truly lives up to the elder scrolls name.",3
"played it on 360 first, as most pc gamers know, pc ports are usually better, this is no exception. amazing mods out there adding hours of content. must buy.",1
"while the base game is good entertaining for about 40-50 hours, the mods and workshop will give you almost unlimited content. this extra content can alter the already existing gameplay or add even more. is it worth 15? yes. and if you get it during a sale be sure to pick up the legendary edition to get some sweet dlc",1
"absolutely amazing! there are so many mods to enhance and/or make the game funnier/more entertaining",1
"absolutly fantastic, this is a exemple to all other developers that modding sells copies and increases the quality of your game in a huge way.",1
"played roughly 1,200 hours on xbox have all achievements and dlc but after 1 year of not playing ihad to buy it on pc just to play again",1
"one of my favourite things to do in games is to explore every nook and cranny of the world, find every bit of loot and lore, see everything. in terms of satisfying that desire, skyrim is like crack cocaine. i cant get enough of it. not to say that im into cocaine  you know what i mean. full review here:",1
"skyrim is the best video game ive ever played. the graphics and storyline are incredible. there are so many routes you can take in building up your character and i love it. i would definitely recommend it.",1
"honestly?.. i dont even think i need to make a review but... who cares. elder scrolls v: skyrim is probably one of my favourite games. you can go anywhere you like and do anything you want and nobody will care, except the guards if your feeling lucky. 20/10 you need to get elder scrolls v: skyrim, you will not regret it :)",1
"such an amazing game! totally improves upon oblivion and borrows several elements that were good in the fallout series. a truly massive world with endless possiblities, things to do, and places to see.",2
"this is the most cash game ever, if you dont beleive me youre probably gay.",1
"this game is pretty awesome! a brief list of key features: go on adventures. get cool mods. get mad at crashes. kill nazeem but seriously, this is probably the best game around for just going on random adventures. while maybe not as large in explorable space as other elder scrolls titles, with steam workshop support, you can easily add all kinds of mods to increase your explorable land mass, and more. and who doesnt want to be a totally awesome superhuman hero? this is the only game i have ever heard of/played where you could potentially decapitate someone with a shield bash. 100/10",2
"the only place that killing chickens that could actually get your char killed",1
"got drunk and had sex with a goat. best game ever.",1
"even though the previous titles in the series were far better, skyrim still overshadows a great deal of other rpgs and fantasy games.",1
"you need to have at least 100 hours to enjoy this great game.",2
"skyrim is a game i would highly recommend. the fact that you can get so many different kinds of mods for the game is pretty cool. being able to go anywhere and do just about anything in the game makes it pretty superb in my opinion. the story line for the main quests are interesting, making you feel like you are in world of skyrim.",1
"so after installing the sexmods i went and started my life as a redguard  who also enjoyed animal . game of the year 10/10",1
"i climed a moutain with a horse 10/10 would play again.",1
"i had the pirate copy of this. barely played it. now i bought it, and it consumed all my life. 100/100",1
"definitely the best rpg and possibly the best game i have ever played. the world is immersive, the graphics are realistic and engaging, and its the first game where i havent disabled the ambient music. magic effects are incredible, as are the enhanced kill shots. variety of game play from exploration to puzzles to battles keeps me entertained and engaged in the story. there are numerous side quests - and its easy to get distracted from the main storyline because of that...but with the feel of never-ending game play i dont worry that ill eventually get to killing the big dragon. mods bring this game to life as well - adding more realism to textures, water, and giving the player the ability to truly customize their experience. kudos to bethesda / steam for making this process simple, easy, and fun. this game is going to be part of my collection for a long time.",2
"bethesda did it again! a fun rpg that you will spend countless hours into, 100% worth the $60 i paid. plus on the pc version you get so many epic mods by the many communitys of mod makers. 9.5/10 goty rpg 2011",3
"my game keeps on crashing but i still recomend this game because it just needs to update",1
"this is an epic game!!!!!!!!! its one of my favorites but not my absolluter favorite. the great thing about is mostley never lag.",1
"i have played all the chapters of the elder scrolls series and i can safely say this is the best one ever. even more, this is the best action rpg full stop. great choice of races, the chance to evolve the character to suit your fighting style (long/short range weapon/magic) and an immense open world to explore. the main quest will entertain for many hours however it is easy to go over the 200 hours just by exploring and completing the side quests. the scenery is very detailed however the entire game can become basically life-like with the help of mods. the steam workshop makes adding/removing/creating them very easy. the community behind this workshop will bring new material almost every day. currently i run the game with over 20 mods and i never experienced a crash. i would definitely recommend this game not only to fans of the series, but to anyone who is even remotely interested in pc gaming, thanks",1
"truly amazing game, even in the vanilla 10/10, add in dlc 30/10 and/or mod it yourself or find something that suits you! skyrim is fantastic",2
"i have bought 3 copys on steam, 2 for ps3 and 1 for xbox. im so inlove with this game i fear for myself for when the next tes comes out.",1
"my most played game, must return to playing... and its dawn!!! i am the dragonborn!!!",1
"this is the best elder scroll game yet. it has 3 different addons, dawnguard,hearthfire,and dragonbor i give this game 5 out of 5",1
"an amazing game to have and i cannot wait to see what the next elder scrolls will be like for the next the gen consoles! one game will be for the record books once more!",1
"a very amazing game. im not usally a rpg guy but this game is incredible. the main quest is kind of dissapointing in the end, but fun noetheless. tons of weapons and armor to keep combat fun, and for once i liked using magic commands. very entertaining with the billions of quests too. its a nice change from all the shooters too. i also recomend it if you want to take a break from multiplayer. the giant world is amazing, you could spent hours just traveling village to village, but its actually beautiful, not boring. if you like rpgs, this game will make your fus do ra. 9.7",1
"playing it through the 1st run through is great as it takes a while to finish off the campaign. the missions are diverse and intense, yet some show surreal serenity. the one problem which i have come across is repetitiveness, as when you make a new character you will find that you will drop off slowly. - squinty",1
"this game consumes almost your entire life it is so overwhelming at first. the weekend i got it i put like 30 hours in, it is fantastic fantasy base and the modding community really shines. if you plan to get this make sure you dont have parental responsibilities or work/financial.",1
"elder scrolls is the best damn series ever and lore is epic in the world of tamriel and im a true nord myself but theres alot of lore taking action in this game and on pc this game is just badass mods make the game more exciting i mean on 360 and ps3 i still loved this game so yeah and just to let you know this games like four years old and its 2014 and people are still making those great quest and other epic mods i suggest you get this game you will know it when you get and play it you will surely enjoy the elder scrolls v skyrims experience.",1
"having spent many hours (days, weeks :-) playing skyrim, i finally feel qualified to report that it is without doubt one of the best games available on steam. the vanilla game is very good but where this addition excels is in the mods and the modding community attached to it. with over 8,000 mods, you can play as anyone from an immortal god sent to save the planet, to a serial  and murderer intent on destroying it (i have been both). and anyone or anything you can think of in between! be warned though, this one will consume you and your time. having cut me teeth on tes iv oblivion, i had high hopes for this sequal and it did not disappoint. if you consider yourself a true gamer or have ever wondered what it would be like to really live another life (within or outside the law), skyrim is a must have!",2
"it is awesome to mod this game and  around with the console commands",1
"this is a masterpiece, a perfect game, i love it!.",1
"absolutely fantastic! i put 86 hours into this game before uninstalling it, and that was all on my first playthrough. im sure ill eventually go back and try to get more done and even start another character. there is so much to do, and this is the first gave ive ever bothered to get 100% achievements for. if you played oblivion and enjoyed it, you will love this as well. there is an equivalent to a mages guild, thieves guild, fighters guild, assassins guild, a civil war pick a side questilne, and the main quest line, along with countless side quests along the way. there is so much to do and explore that youll defintely get your moneys worth, and if you pick this up later on sale or even with a bundle if/when they come out with an expansion/dlc, you wont be sorry. not one bit.",1
"best elder scrolls out in my opinion. i played oblivion which was awesome at the time, but then i played skyrim. i was amazed. full of non-stop action, and also has a couple of puzzles and interesting things to find out. defo worth tha money. and if you like these games and graphics are not a problem 2 u (you are not botherd if they are not as good) you should try oblivion( iv ) and morrowind ( iii ).",1
"best rpg ever, simply amazing how the game makes you feel immersed and if you dont like something you can just download a mod for it on the workshop!",2
"for my money, skyrim is the best game to come out on steam in 2011. bethesda gave a 11-11-11 release date for this game, they stuck to it and they wisely used steamworks to launch it. bugs be damned, skyrims visuals will make your jaw drop, it has one of the best soundtracks of any fantasy anything, and its packed into a relatively tiny 5gb download on steam. in many ways skyrim is now my de-facto fantasy rpg that all others will need to live up to. the amount of content in the game is staggering, and the ways you can play are numerous. if you ever thought you might like to slay a dragon, skyrim is your jam. it has the best dragon fights ive ever played because they are completely unique every time and there are an infinite amount of dragons to be slain! i will be replaying this game for years to come, which is about right for how long it takes for a new elder scrolls to release.",2
"enormous beautiful world with loads of places to loot and visit. plus an infinite ammount of addons to freely download to mod your game to your hearts content. a bit much the same as the previous installments though, the world and its inhabitants are very static and the main quest/storyline is pretty lackluster. 3/5",1
"this game wtf. trying to install mods not working+trying to install free hd textures not working= why even try to buy it?",1
"i avoided this game because people were so crazy about it when it first came out... well, now i understand why. the graphics are great, i love bethesda, there are endless missions, so the game is seemingly endless, the open world is awesome... i could go on and on. there are always things that irritate me about games, but i let them go because i love playing this game.",1
"you are wasting oxygen if you havent clicked purchase yet....",1
"i have played alots of hours on xbox 360, it was great but with a new pc and the grapics! <3",1
"skyrim is the latest addition to the elder scrolls serie and it is stands triumphant on the smoldering remains of a dragon looking down on its smaller and amazed siblings. a great game, all in all. totally recommend this to friends. now buy it. damnit. now.",1
"played skyrim for the 360. its a hell of a game. gaphics are great and game play is long. if you enjoy open world play its a must play. i spent over 100 hours playing it. loved it. i still like fallout 3 more but skyrim was a great for the melee play. i recommend this game!",1
"mods for all (even fandoms!), great visuals, good atmospheric effects, reasonable enemy difficulty, spectacular leveling mechanics (i played oblivion); marvelous dlc which brought new areas, weapons and armor, locations, characters, and different possibilities for your character. in short: buy this amazing ing game as soon as you can. and get the legendary edition.",1
"if you have never played this game. then dont. its gonna steal your life away. 10/10",1
"pure excellence !!!!! this game is amazing, the scenery is incredible and the gameplay is outstanding. 9/10",1
"no one does sandbox rpg games like bestesda. i tell you now, this game is a significant edition to the elder scrolls series and you will enjoy every single hour of the 100+ hours you will play this game. you create the character you want to be - wizard, thief, warrior, a mixture of two, or all three! and the vast story of the elder scrolls series including its history (stuff like the great war, but also all the other law stuff!) just makes the game so rich. things like graphics, combat, magic, dialogue, and side quests are a significant improvement from oblivion. however, some steamlining has been done so that some features that should have been in the game but arent, such as that magic spell to unlock doors, crates, and chests has been taken out, but honestly these features are so small that they have no impact on the experience of the game. and, youll probably just find a mod to sort out any features you want in the game due to the best steam workshop experience ever done! now buy the god damn game.",2
"the best elder scrolls game to this date. the mod community makes this game easily game of the decade",1
"skyrim is an amazing game where you can be the dragonborn, cast shouts, do magic, and defeat the neverending waves of evil in the land of skyrim. you can do outstanding things like dying repeatedly, sitting in your desk chair for hours trying to farm your smithing skill, killing innocent people, and if you have mods, killing children, and fapping to naked women! what else could you want from an amazing rpg game where youre the ultimate badass *to an extent*? 10/10 it was ok",1
"addicting game! too bad the vanilla characters are so ugly :/",1
"i never was so elder scrolls fan but i tried game jus blow my mind game is so epic! 10/10",1
"absolutely one of the best game ever... so much to do with so much immersion this is the pinnacle of rpgs at the moment, you can lose yourself for hours.",1
"ive seen warriors from hammerfell. they had curved. swords. 11.5/10",1
"quite possibly the biggest rpg ive played thanks to the ever growing list of mods to add to an already great vanilla game, skyrim is without a doubt, a must play for any modern rpg fan.",1
"like bland open worlds where you dont care about the story or any of the characters in the game? then this is the game for you",1
"best game ive played so far most definitely worth buying",1
"the base game is complete rubbish. mod it and make it worth it. thank you steam workshop. regardless though stealth builds are still overpowered and at a certain point the game proves no challenge. but hey if you like to sit at home and talk to yourself as you play your character to mimick their interactions then good on you. this game is for you. i played this game on the xbox, and i thought i could repeat it. i was wrong. even with mods i was wrong. knowing whats to come just made it boring. i cast it aside. so if you like a game that proves no challenge, lets you kill leaders of badass groups with a single swipe of your hand, and forces you to do similar quests over and over again this game is for you! just remember to mod it up or else you will hate your life.",1
"nearly unlimited possibilites thanks to bethesda and the modding community!",1
"there is so much to do in the game and it is so much fun",1
"had this on the ps3 when it came out and bought it during the thanksgiving sale. totally worth it. it is so much better on pc then it is on console",1
"you would have to literally be blind to not at least try this holy taco of a game.",1
"one of the best games. only real weakness is multiplayer.",1
"girlfriend leaves for a week. one handed increases to 100.",1
"alright so, i own this on xbox, ps3 & pc. i actually cant get enough of it. it gets a little old sometimes and ill stop playing for awhile maybe a month but trust me, i think i can safely say ive spent at least like 300 hours playing this game and havent even come close to clearing all the places, finishing all the quests or even finishing the main story <3 i do start new games often and swap from one consle to the next but my freaking god this is a game that ill probably still enjoy when im like 60 (: im also writing a fan fiction about some of the things you do in skyrim <3 i know lame isnt it? but still, this game will stand the test of time , cant wait for dawnguard ! 100/100",1
"this game is so cool.the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is interesting. the details is so gorgeous. dragons flying in the air and wolfs attack you.....so fantastic. you can hunt rabbits, deers and who knows what else. i can tell..... the game is worth the money :)",1
"no doubt about it! this is the game of the year! massive open world, do as you chose, play however you like. very atmospheric and beautiful world (and the characters no long look like manequins) buy this and it will suck you in for ages. well worth the purchase and much replayability!",2
"excellent, well rounded in every way. imagine got on steriods. 10/10 dlc is amazing as well",1
"more fun than a bag of thermite and a box of matches.",3
"one of the best games ive ever played. skyrim has a ton of things to do too",1
"just amazing okay do i need to say more its elder scrolls",1
"graphics: fantastic outdoor locations make sure you have hd textures downloaded for the best experience, i still stop and stare at the mountains from time to time :d 9/10 story: like most es games the main story can be ignored and adventuring and side questing can be had! 9/10 gameplay: the first person hack and slash combat does feel a little weird like your slicing air... but its still fun enough its always fun to play with shouts and experiment with them as well. spells are great and look really nice too. random encounters are pretty cool but they are few and far between. the questing bugs are also really annoying sometimes npcs dont trigger a certain event and you are a bit on the stuck side >_> 8/10 replay value: tons of replay value here customizing new characters and choosing to do things differentlly will be prominent in your skyrim experience. 10/10",1
"if this game were a potato, it would be a bacon-wrapped potato.",2
"great game, add some mods from the workshop with ease.",2
"this game is definitly one of the most axesome games ever! you can literally do what you want: you can be a dragonslaying badass, or just a random idiot who kills everything and everyone he sees, or if you are more a friendly type, you can talk to random people and help the with the most farfetched problems. i also do like the questlines, but mostly they are quite predictable. i mean every time you join a faction, the leader dies, and they need a new one. gess who that will be... a while ago, i found out that all the caves are made by the same 8 persons! (i hope they era well payed) so if you were wondering why all the caves are almost the same... but i really love this game and it nevers gets boring. fus ro dah!!",1
"got murdered 5 times and lost all my stuff becouse i stole a cheese wheel. 10/10",1
"this is the best game i have ever played :) so many things to do and so much fun!",1
"any game where youve logged in excess of two working weeks in and still want to spend more time on is doing something right. i particularly love the soundtrack, and the hours and hours of incidental & background music that helps draw you in deeper.",1
"excellent, open world rpg. in my opinion, not as pretty as oblivion, and far easier than oblivion - thus more accessible. immersive, beautiful title, play your own way. can easily log hundreds of hours just exploring side quests. dlc are fun, though not as good as oblivion dlc (horse armour aside!). played extensively and completed on xbox.",1
"the definitive fantasy rpg by one of the two definitive rpg studios (i.e. bioware and bethesda), this game has to be played.",1
"do you need read reviews to buy this game? was cave cold?",1
"skyrim is a great game for people who like rpgs and being able to make their own choices and having lots of fun mods to screw around with",1
"this is an amazing game so much fun you will spend days on this game, good graphics and gameplay",1
"i initially bought and completed this game for the 360, but like all elder scrolls games this gem truly shines on pc. with the incredible mod community skyrim feels like a whole new experience. 9/10",1
"welll dont get why you would not like this game it has a good story it has to many mods that just make the game alot more fun. if you are done with the story line and you dont know what to do thare are alot of side quests to go on or just get a dlc like dawnguard one more thing thare are alot of easter eggs and secret npcs and items to find.",1
"help me! im starting to see dragon everywhere! i cant....stop... doing one... more... quest!",1
"the best rpg game ever created. i wish there was more dlcs.",1
"one of my favorite games to date. you can literally play this game for months and not complete everything. you make make the game completely unique to how you want to play. got a little easy as you became more advanced and crafted higher items, making the fights a little less challenging. however the stories were always interesting and just the fact that i could make the game my own kept me coming. so many little secret areas and things to find. tons of side quests. amazing graphics. completely recommend.",1
"controls are awful. i constantly find myself trying to bring up a shield (or any other item) with the numeric hotkeys, and it just brings up some useless spell. im not just pressing the wrong keys because i check my hotkeys after dying and the spell was at 8, my shield 2. completely intersting game with useless pc controls. just deleted from my computer.",1
"after 557 hours, ive betten all that dlcs and snagged evey acheivment.. both proud and sad at the same time.. but i loved every minute!!",2
"i absolutely love this game. the graphics could be better, but back in 2011 i thought they were magical. the games only flaw is that it is single player. i know that there is the elder scrolls online now, but i would prefer a two to four player co-op game with a single player option. aside from that, this is one of my all-time favorite video games. the freedom it permits is spectacular. i have played this game on both consols and my pc since the day it came out, and i can count the number of times i have run into the end of the world on one hand. the steam community also contributes heavily through the steam workshop, producing mods that add even more adventure and excitement to the game. totally worth buying. 10/10 p.s. the dlcs are worth it too. buy the legendary edition.",2
"fus ro no wait too many mods my game crashed. 10/10",1
"just get all the mods. vanilla, this game is so unbelievably terrible. i could not play five hours. but on the flipside- get skyui, skse go check out gophers channel, get my favorite mod of all time- interesting npcs. just dont play vanilla.",1
